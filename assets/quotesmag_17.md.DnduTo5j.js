Any one of them (including the villains) could be a member of your family. All were flawed with humanity. The mystery is always secondary to the individuals involved. This is a great read that gets better with each reading."},{"Title":"HAVE HIS CARCASE.","review":"The mysteries of Dorothy L. Sayers are intricate and intelligent, models of perfectly maddening puzzles that readers can barely solve. \\"Have His Carcase\\" is no exception, a fine round and round-about mystery that keeps readers (and the two detectives) searching till the final chapter.The story finds Harriet Vane, recently acquited of murder, on a walking vacation. Mystery has a way of following her, and she encounters a dead body on the beach. Was it suicide or murder? Knowing that the tide is about to come in, Harriet takes pictures and clues to preserve what she can, and searches out the local authorities. Lord Peter Wimsey, gentleman detective, comes to Harriet's aid and also delves into the crime, a case of murder with a baffling array of suspects and alibis. Every clue and every alibi makes a strong case for suicide, but Wimsey knows it to be a murder, if only he could prove it.\\"Have His Carcase\\" is a story with a lot on its plate; the wide cast of characters creates a web of further mystery and cluelessness around the death. This is all layered in with the flirtation between Wimsey and Vane, a delectable pairing of romance and comedy, as Harriet rebuffs Wimsey's marriage proposals at every turn. Sayers is perhaps almost too intelligent in her mysteries, giving her detectives almost unlimited knowledge on a wide range of topics. The chapters involving ciphers are particularly hard to decipher, but do little to distract from the excellent mystery at hand. And while the story does seem to go round and round, it comes full circle in the end."},{"Title":"HAVE HIS CARCASE.","review":"Sayers once again delivers a solid, old-fashioned mystery story set in the English countryside. The body of a gigolo is discovered by Harriet Vane, who was recently rescued by Lord Peter from being wrongly convicted for murder. Vane is supposedly on vacation--on a walking tour to recover from her ordeal, but ends up investigating a murder instead. Lord Peter is madly in love with her but she does not return his affections.Vane discovers the bloody body on the beach as the tide is coming in. She rushes to town as quickly as possible to notify the police but is unable to do so before the body is swept away on the tides. Lord Peter comes to stay at the seaside resort to investigate the crime and continue his courtship. While working on the mystery together, Vane's feelings for Lord Peter vary from irritation to camaraderie to a reluctant affection.Lord Peter is a charming, intelligent sleuth who has met his intellectual match in Harriet Vane. This further installment of his adventures evokes the nostalgic atmosphere of an English seaside town during the early 1930's. It also provides an intricate murder mystery and the growing pains of a passionate relationship. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"HAVE HIS CARCASE.","review":"Harriet Vane, well-known mystery writer, has decided to take a walking holiday along the English coast. She would like a bit of solitude to work on her latest novel and to recover from the unpleasantness of being tried for the murder of her former lover (STRONG POISON). She would also like to put some distance between her and Lord Peter Wimsey who had uncovered the true culprit and saved her from prison. Since this is a mystery novel by Sayers Harriet's plans quickly changed.She stopped for lunch and a short nap on the beach and woke to discover a dead body nearby. In this pre-cell phone age (1930's) reporting the crime to the police became a lengthy affair. Once the police became involved the press and Lord Peter were not far behing putting a decisive end to Harriet's quiet holiday. Soon Harriet and Peter found themselves embroiled in the world of resort life - middle-aged widows, professional dance partners, fishermen, farmers, 'kept' women and long-lost royalty. In the end of course the two triumph, solving the baffling crime.Lord Peter's infatuation with Harriet begun in STRONG POISON, has a chance to grow during this novel and is beginning to be returned by Harriet. The interactions between the two are well written and a treat for the Peter/Harriet romance fans without detracting from the mystery. As always with Sayers' work the secondary characters are well written and engaging, the plot intricately plotted and clever. Unfortunately Sayers goes into excrutiating detail at times, particularly concerning a rather complicated cipher - skim or skip that chapter.All in all this is an excellent story, a definite must read for Lord Peter fans, particularly those into the Peter and Harriet romance but this is not the place to begin start with one of the earliest Lord Peter stories or STRONG POISON to begin the Peter/Harriet romance."},{"Title":"HAVE HIS CARCASE.","review":"An intricate, well-paced plot full of pathos and farce.

I particularly enjoy Mr. Carmichael's rendition because he has a lovely range of accents and vocal patterns that easily differentiate the characters.

Parts of the solution were glossed over quickly leaving confusion and other parts were explained ad nauseum. The ideas and plot were good. The end came too quickly without a good summation/ conclusion to the story. It sort of left you hanging."},{"Title":"HAVE HIS CARCASE.","review":"The second of Sayers' Wimsey/Vane mysteries, \\"Have His Carcase\\" never quite gripped me the way \\"Strong Poison\\" did. The earlier mystery placed Harriet Vane in jeopardy should Lord Peter prove unable to exonerate her. In this book there is no such risk-factor, consequently the story is little more than a mental exercise regimen for two not-so-old, not-so-dear friends (although they do get quite a bit better acquainted on this outing). The book is also a few chapters too long (or short, depending on your point of view); \\"the evidence of the mannequin,\\" for instance, made only a minor contribution to the denouement and could have been eliminated - or it could have been better capitalized upon and drawn in several of the women characters as suspects. The murder plot is definitely overcomplicated and would likely never occur in real life ... unless you wanted to commit a murder that would baffle the police and almost thwart Wimsey and Vane as well (in which case it's *exactly* what you'd do).For its several shortcomings, \\"Carcase\\" is still a very enjoyable read. The verbal sparring between Wimsey and Vane is priceless. Vane's perspective as a mystery novelist adds a bit of behind-the-scenes color. The local police force occasionally comes off a bit too indulgent of the amateur investigators, but it was very nice that they were portrayed as neither blustering know-it-alls nor no-nothing bumpkins. Bunter's quest through London involves some of the best written pacing I've ever read.A couple final points: The word \\"carcase\\" in the title would nowadays be written as \\"carcass.\\" Before reading the book I thought it had something to do with those large trunks that used to get strapped onto the back of cars. The title actually refers to the fact that before a murder investigation can go forward, the police need to have the body (or its remains) at hand. Point two: Don't read \\"the evidence of the cipher\\" (Chapter 28) when you are tired; while it provides a very good look at a cryptographer's work, it carries with it the potential risk of causing your head to explode. Be careful, you really wouldn't want that to happen. Trust me."},{"Title":"HAVE HIS CARCASE.","review":"Dorothy L Sayers provided some of the great treasures to be found in the so-called &quot;Golden Age of Detective Fiction&quot;. A classical scholar with a formidable intellect, she was an eminent practitioner and an eloquent critic of detective fiction. Her feisty, detective fiction writing character, Harriet Vane, and her aristocratic, monocled, amateur detective, Lord Peter Wimsey, may be found together for the second time in her 1932 novel &quot;Have His Carcase&quot;.On a walking holiday, while recovering from a court case in which she was alleged to have killed her lover, Harriet Vane discovers the body of a man. It is lying on rocks on a beach, close to low tide level. The evidence suggests suicide. After taking photographs with her camera, finding a cut throat razor and removing a shoe from the corpse, Harriet vainly tries to enlist help in moving the body before it is washed away by the incoming tide. The local police force is alerted and so is Lord Peter Wimsey.This is a long novel. Interest focuses not only on the solution to the mystery but also on the likelihood of Wimsey succeeding with his wish to marry Harriet. There is witty dialogue, there are fulsome reports from a range of eccentric characters, there are descriptions of the human anatomy and how it responds to the throat being cut, there is an interminable attempt to decode a ciphered letter, and there are classical quotations provided at the start of each chapter. There is little dramatic tension, no suspense, and no thrills. Dorothy L Sayers was a cultivated, fluent writer, sometimes boring but never banal.If your tolerance of boredom is low, but your credit balance at the bank is high, then invest in the audio tape reading of the book provided by Ian Carmichael. English actor Ian Carmichael has had great success associated with various adaptations of the novels of Dorothy L Sayers. He brings wonderful energy and gusto to this full-length reading, enough to keep you delighted for more than fifteen hours."},{"Title":"HAVE HIS CARCASE.","review":"I recommend this book primarily because it contains Lord Wimsey and Harriet's solution of a Playfair cipher.Most readers will recall Sherlock Holmes' solution of the Dancing Men cipher (recounted in Conan Doyle's The Adventure of the Dancing Men) and Legrand's solution of Captain Kidd's cipher (recounted in Poe's The Gold Bug). Both of these are simple substitution ciphers, easily broken if one knows certain facts about the English language, such as the order of letter frequency (E, T, O, A, N . . .) The Playfair cipher, on the other hand, is an order of magnitude more difficult to solve. It is a digram cipher, using pairs of letters (there are 26x26=676 possible digrams) instead of individual letters to encrypt the message. Tables of digram frequencies are of little use in decrypting short messages. Other methods are required. The mechanics are explained in the text.The Playfair cipher was used operationally in WWII and to this day remains unsolvable as a one-time, short message, unknown-keyword cipher, unless you can guess one of the plaintext words. Wimsey and Harriet were lucky that they were dealing with an amateur.Sayer's audacious trump of Conan Doyle and Poe caught my attention. The rest of the book is, to put it mildly, well-plotted. There is evidence here that native British intelligence far exceeds what one finds in the colonies. No wonder Sayers is so popular."},{"Title":"HAVE HIS CARCASE.","review":"All of Dorothy Sayers' mysteries are worth reading. She has a command of English and a story-telling ability that makes her, in my opinion, one of the two greatest mystery writers of the twentieth century. Most of Ms. Sayers' mysteries feature Lord Peter, second son of the Duke of Denver. He is one of the most delightful characters in English literature and well worth meeting in any of Ms. Sayers books. Most of the Lord Peter mysteries stand alone and can be read without worrying about sequence. However four of the mysteries involve Harriet Vane, and for maximum enjoyment, those four mysteries should be read in order. Strong Poison describes the first meeting between Harriet and Lord Peter. Have His Carcase explores the relationship between the two of them as they investigate the death of a man whose body Harriet discovers while hiking along a deserted beach. The interaction between the two of them can best be understood and appreciated if Strong Poison is read first. Have His Carcase may be the least enjoyable of the four romance-mysteries involving Harriet, but this book leads to the final two books in the series, and those two books are the finest romance-mysteries ever written."},{"Title":"HAVE HIS CARCASE.","review":"Though I eagerly awaited the Kindle editions of Dorothy Sayers' Lord Peter Wimsey/Harriet Vane novels, which are favorites of mine, the enormous number of typos make for laborious and irritating reading, with multiple errors per page. Indeed, were I not already intimate with the books, some passages woud make no sense as transcribed: my familiarity allows me to decode the errors. For ten dollars a book, Amazon, your readers deserve better.The book itself is literate and serves well to advance the relationship between the two main characters. From first book to last, Sayers' style develops from superficial to highly reflective and deeply emotional."},{"Title":"HAVE HIS CARCASE.","review":"I was quite enjoying this lengthy book - both the mystery itself and the Vane/Wimsey interactions - right up to the last page or so when the abrupt, vague, disappointing, and out of character ending left me completely flat. It's almost as if the author got tired after 448 pages and just wanted to finish the story ASAP. I don't want to spoil it for anyone, so I'll leave it at that except to reassure that the mystery itself is solved; it's the *resolution* that's lacking.I've been reading the Lord Peter Wimsey stories in chronological order (and would rate nearly all of them so far as 4+ Stars). That's a good thing, because if this book had been my first Wimsey book, I'm not sure I would have read any further."},{"Title":"HAVE HIS CARCASE.","review":"A puzzling murder where the time of death is crucial.

I hated it."},{"Title":"HAVE HIS CARCASE.","review":"The reviews I value most on amazon are those for audio books, because not only does the quality of the writing need to be ascertained, but also the quality of the reader -- a much more nebulus and subjective thing to assess. I have several of my favorite Sayers novels on audio, and the Petherbridge ones are my preference, despite their being abridged. David Case also does an excellent job on his narration of Whose Body. But I must add my support to the previous post which noted that Ian Carmichael can be difficult to follow. Carmichael does a decent Whimsey, but cannot bend his voice enough to create distinct characters beyond Whimsey. All too often I find myself backing up to replay episodes of conversation because I can't keep track of WHO is talking -- and this is despite having read the book! I cannot recommend the Carmichael readings to those unfamilar with the original works. Start with Petherbridge instead."},{"Title":"HAVE HIS CARCASE.","review":"In this, the second of the Vane/Wimsey novels, the story starts with Harriet Vane walking along the seaside and finding a corpse. Death by throat-cutting. Enter Lord Peter Wimsey. He and Harriet set out to solve the mystery of who killed the seaside corpse, with help from Bunter and the local police. Sayers excels at witty dialogue, of which there is plenty between Harriet and Peter, and at overly-complicated most-unlikely murder methods. This novel also contains a cipher, which Peter and Harriet decode. This is a good read for those who are already fans of Wimsey and Vane, but the story isn't as strong as \\"Strong Poison\\" or \\"Guady Night.\\""},{"Title":"HAVE HIS CARCASE.","review":"Dorothy Sayers was far ahead of her time when she wrote the Lord Peter Wimsey mystery novels in the late 1920's and early-to-mid 1930's. She gave her prime characters hearts and souls to the point where her truly excellent mystery puzzles actually became secondary to our following the lives of people we came to know and care about through reading her books. Even her minor characters were three-dimensional and recognizable as \\"real\\" people. \\"Have His Carcase\\" is one of her best, with Lord Peter and Harriet Vane solving a fascinating mystery while carefully exploring, with the civilized delicacy of their time, their feelings for one another.

Unfortunately, not the parts that the writer intended to be funny.For a writer who always was so painstakingly correct about timetibles, technicalities etc, Ms Sayers had made an astounding mess with her facts.The victim is a Russian - and Pavlo is his name. Sorry, Dorothy, had he been a Russian, his name would have been Pavel or Paul, given that we're supposed to be talking about Russian aristocracy. Pavlo is an Ukrainian name. It tantamount to calling a character Pierre and insisting he's an Englishman.Also, if one insists on the poor victim receiving letters with Czechoslovakian stamps, one should not make the evil-doers send them from Warsaw. Polish stamps would surely be better.Thirdly, it doesn't do to make seemingly intelligent characters speculate that an illness which can be inherited only through female ancestors could have been a proof positive that the sufferer is a descendant of a specified man... not after the female-line business was thoroughly explained in a previous paragraph, anyway.And, top of the tops, there comes a scene when the good British jurors are not too slighly ridiculed for thinking in cliches about the foreigners...

Unfortunately the only thing that tends to let this book down is 'Erik's image'. With Christine narrating it is very difficult to find out what Erik is feeling inside. Christine is more determined what is good for her character but slightly demanding and bossy. Erik is also prone to cruelty and temper fits. The first few pages of the book are very good but it starts to fumble towards the end. Fans of Erik will not be pleased by the way he is described ie. his face and eating habits, although on a brighter side some of his comments are incredibly funny and will make you laugh.

Young. The series details events, people, places, and the language in which Isaiah was written, in a style that makes this commentary easy to read and understand. Just like any commentary, Young takes Isaiah verse by verse and phrase by phrase and comments upon the text. Moreover, Young is a conservative scholar and is therefore not convinced and trapped into the ever popular liberal view of the Deutero-Isaiah hypothesis; a source division that was spawned by Johann C. Doederlin in 1789. Young sees Isaiah as being written by a single author and thus his commentary is built around this idea. Young is very in depth in his commenting and understanding of the text of Isaiah. For that reason there are certain details that he covers which aid in the reader's understanding of what Isaiah is communicating to his audience; details which might otherwise be overlooked to the untrained eye. Therefore, if you are wanting a solid and very helpful commentary on the book of Isaiah, then I highly recommend this one."},{"Title":"The Book of Isaiah (3 volumes)","review":"The hardcover 3 volume set seems to be out of print!

His exposition rests upon a firm conviction that the text is holy and is God-breathed. Isaiah is the sole human author, and according to Young it is not a compilation of the efforts of various editors.He avoids injecting many of the popular and wild theories popular today, instead he sticks to the text and the facts as presented in the Biblical context, supplemented with some archaeological data. Hence the reader stands upon revealed facts, not contrived theories. Young moves along verse by verse, adding wonderful illumination and clarity when needed.One proof that we have a very stable copy of Isaiah is the Qumran scroll from the 2nd century BC, with a text 99.5 percent identical to today's Hebrew edition.As a commentary, it is one of the best. It is HIGHLY recommended for every believer. Most of the Hebrew words are transliterated, but not all. The text is very readable, and useful for beginners or experts in Biblical studies.At the end of each volume is an index of persons, authors cited, and passages cited.

I would highly recommend Brevard Childs's and Motyer's commentaries on Isaiah over this 3 volume set, but this is still something of a standard resource for more traditional conservative Protestants who veer towards an amillennial eschatology and interpretation of the Old Testament. If you do not appreciate historic pre-millennialism or dispensationalism you will prefer Young's interpretation of the eschatological passages in Isaiah that have been traditionally interpeted by most Chrisitians since Augustine as referring to the Church age, rather than as literal future promises to the people of Israel of Isaiah's time."},{"Title":"The Book of Isaiah (3 volumes)","review":"Young has done a fabulous job teaching the book of Isaiah in print.

Cobban gives us his vision of the reigns of Louis XV and Louis XVI and the French Revolution. His accents are sometimes very pronounced (e.g. 'the sinister shade of atheism').His general position is that 'theory plays little part in the determining policies. The actions of the revolutionaries were prescribed by the need to find practical solutions to immediate problems.'The central theme of his book is 'bread' (famine) for the Third Estate and 'financial crisis' for the powerful in the Old Regime. The financial crises were provoked by war (e.g. the American War) and the refusal by the wealthy (aristocracy, Church) to pay taxes.Other factors were the weakness of the kings and the functioning of the Old Regime with its bureaucratic control of industry and trade.Louis XVI had to summon the States-General, which permitted the Third Estate to take power (normally it was always in a minority position of 2 against 1). But immediately, there were internecine fights between the different factions in it. The Committee of Public Safety eliminated the right (Danton) and the left, but the members of the Committe then fought among themselves: Robespierre was guillotined. In fact, 85 % of the guillotined belonged to the Third Estate.When the new revolutionary army became sufficiently professionalized, the political role of the people was finished. The well-to-do within the Third Estate, who had used the discontent of the peasants and the craftsmen, could lean on the army to take power, until one of the generals rose above everybody and became France's new autocrat.Of course, this small book cannot give detailed explanations of all events or insightful portraits of all important characters, but it is told with dash, insight and vision.It would not have been written had the Church still ruled, because the Vatican attacked vehemently the 'monstrous right to liberty of thought and writing.'A masterly told tale about 'the nursery of the modern world'."},{"Title":"A History of Modern France: Volume 1: 1715-1799","review":"It's hard to believe now, but back in the 1950s the standard academic interpretation of the French Revolution was a Marxist one. The revolt against and eventual fall of the French monarchy, went the standard version, was the inevitable product of social contradictions and class conflict arising from processes of industrialization. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, historians such as Francois Furet and Alfred Cobban began to advance alternative explanations for the revolutionary upheavals of the 1790s. Their revised views of the Revolution looked to social and political motivations rather than purely economic ones. In 1964, Cobban, a professor of French History at University College London, published a now-famous lecture series outlining the new \\"revisionist\\" view, under the title _The Social Interpretation of the French Revolution_. However, he had already published in 1957 a slightly less well-known study of the late ancien regime and revolutionary period under the relatively innocuous title _A History of Modern France 1715-1799_. This earlier book lays out and argues for the central points of the revisionist thesis while providing a succinct and fluid overview of the period.Cobban's narrative commences with the death in 1715 of Louis XIV after 54 years of personal rule. Louis XIV had used those five decades to perfect a system of absolutist monarchy and to exert French power and influence throughout the continent of Europe. However his unquestioned ascendancy over a traditionally proud and independent aristocracy had not come without cost. Cobban writes, \\"Louis had not so much suppressed the declining aristocratic elements in the state as bought them off at high price.\\" In exchange for obedience, the wealthiest members of French society received broad exemption from royal taxation. Even so, vestiges of noble privilege persisted, in particular the \\"parliaments\\" - regional law courts responsible for registering royal edicts, traditionally dominated by the aristocracy, of which the Parliament of Paris was the most influential. For now, the parliaments lay quiescent; later under less domineering monarchs they would spearhead a reassertion of noble rights and privileges.Louis XIV had sought French dominance over the continent through a seemingly endless series of wars. The War of the Spanish Succession (1701-1714) had been fought among the great powers of Europe to determine who would succeed to the Spanish throne and, as importantly, what would be the parameters of the empire inherited by that successor. After more than ten years of conflict in Europe and the Americas, the Bourbon candidate favored by Louis XIV succeeded to the throne of Spain, but under condition of exclusion from the line of inheritance to the kingship of France, thus ensuring that Louis' dream of a union of the French and Spanish kingdoms would not come to pass. Moreover the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht effected a partition of the Spanish empire, with the Spanish Netherlands and territories in northern Italy awarded to France's traditional antagonist Habsburg Austria.The War of the Spanish Succession, then, had concluded with meager political gains for France. It had also concluded at great financial cost. The mountain of war debt left behind by Louis XIV would occasion the first great fiscal crisis of eighteenth century France. The future Louis XV being only five years old in 1715, the governance of France fell to a regency under his cousin Philip of Orleans. Recognizing that a period of peace was essential for national regeneration Orleans embraced the settlements of 1713-1714, concluding an alliance with Britain which would persist until 1731, and even participating with Britain, Holland and Austria in a short war against Spain (the War of the Quadruple Alliance, 1718-1720) when that monarch attempted to challenge the new status quo in Italy.For all his prudent management of foreign affairs, any fiscal dividends which might have accrued fell victim to catastrophic economic policy. Orleans entrusted the state finances to a Scottish adventurer named John Law, a man possessed of some singular theories of finance economics. Money, reasoned Law, had no value in itself but was simply the instrument through which trade is effected. Trade being not only the lifeblood of the nation but also a source of tax revenue which could plug the hole in the royal finances, it would be desirous to stimulate economic activity by maximizing the availability of currency. Law proceeded to consolidate the operations of the French overseas colonies into a great state monopoly trading company, including the slowly developing Louisiana territories in the Americas which brought the trade of the Mississippi region down to overseas markets via the trading post at New Orleans. Combined with a new state banking institution, the Mississippi Company began to produce currency in the form of shares backed by the presumed future profits to be generated by the trade of Louisiana. The resulting speculative bubble burst in 1720: the Mississippi Company collapsed and Law fled into exile. A French distrust of central banking would persist throughout the remainder of the 18th century; France would not again have a central bank until the reign of Napoleon.Law's financial engineering did nothing to solve the ongoing fiscal crisis. True, the wars of Louis XIV had destabilized the royal treasury, but as Cobban makes clear, the essential problem of French finances was one of taxation, not of expenditure. France in the eighteenth century had very considerable resources available to her. It was a period of rapid expansion in trade overseas and population at home. The number of French ships engaged in overseas commerce quadrupled between 1715 and 1789, while the value of trade handled through the port of Bordeaux, France's richest, rose from 40 million livres in 1724 to 250 million livres in 1789. The population of France grew steadily through the course of the century, from about 17 million persons in 1715 to perhaps 26 million in 1789. Revolutionary France was the most populous country in Europe.The expanding wealth of the highest tier of Frenchmen was on view throughout the 1700s in the construction of grand chateaux and manor houses, and the perfection of luxury items for nobles and beneficiaries of the commodity and slave trades with the rich sugar colonies of the French Antilles. The mid eighteenth century was \\"a period in which the cult of the lesser arts\\" - goldsmithing, tapestry weaving, chamber music, the culinary arts - \\"reached perhaps its height.\\" Eighteenth century painting reflected the spirit of the times. The weightier themes of the seventeenth century - the enigmatic classical allegories of Poussin, the luminous seaport sunsets of Claude Lorrain, the brooding midnight portraits of La Tour - gave way to Watteau's whimsical minstrels, Pater's country fetes and the flirting shepherds of Boucher. Cobban's summation of eighteenth century French literature could as well serve for its painting: \\"it was an age of wit rather than wisdom, of optimism rather than a sense of tragic destiny.\\"To be sure, the economic expansion of France did not reflect a perfectly modern economic regime. In many ways France of the eighteenth century represents a curious hybrid of medieval and modern. It was for example, the high-water mark of guild influence over craftsmen and trades, complete with a tangle of rules and regulations governing work and innovation: \\"they prevented, and were intended to prevent, the development of new methods of manufacture.\\" Consequently the pace of industrialization in France lagged far behind that of England: in 1789, Cobban relates, 900 spinning jennies operated in France, while England in that year boasted twenty thousand. Internal customs fees and tariffs further retarded trade. With the pace of industrialization thus stifled, population growth could not be translated to economic growth as it was in England; in fact population increases in these circumstances may have acted as a politically destabilizing force: by 1789, \\"It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that France must have been suffering from intense and increasing rural over-population.\\" And in fact widespread starvation in the countryside motivated revolutionary mobs in the late 1780s and early 1790s.The tension between the middle ages and modernity in France extended to the sphere of governance. As Cobban summarizes, \\"the great king [Louis XIV] had endowed France with a modern system of government while retaining a semi-medieval system of financing it.\\" The taxation system was corrupt, inefficient and increasingly regressive. The single wealthiest institution, the Catholic Church, was entirely exempt (although the clerical government would customarily vote to the crown an annual \\"free gift\\", usually two to three million livres on revenues typically in excess of 120 million per annum). The diminished crown power of taxation hobbled France as a great power; an increasingly chaotic and faction-driven policy process at Versailles under the rule of Louis XV and his son and successor Louis XVI hastened her decline. The popular impression of an extravagant court spending the state into bankruptcy on palaces and finery is a misleading caricature - the greatest pressure on state finances came during wartime. Indeed, \\"The expense of even a small war was greater than that of the biggest palace.\\" Furthermore, \\"war inevitably brought a fiscal crisis.\\" In tracing the history of France's involvement in costly and unproductive wars under the personal rule of Louis XV and XVI, we trace also the slow drift of the ancien regime towards collapse and Revolution.With only brief exceptions, the Orleanist regency and the succeeding premiership of Fleury (1726-1743) were periods of peace and recuperation for France. Fleury followed in the tradition of strong premier minstres in the spirit of Richelieu and Mazarin. If he did nothing to reform the revenue system, he did everything possible to avoid straining the state finances with unnecessary wars. Fleury continued the Orleanist policy of peace with Austria and Spain. With Fleury's premiership we see \\"the most prosperous and successful period in the history of eighteenth century France.\\" When Louis XV plunged France into the War of the Austrian Succession in 1741, it was under the influence of an aristocratic war party at Versailles led by the Comte de Belle Isle and against the advice of an aged and fading Fleury.Upon her father's death in 1740 Maria Theresa of Austria had succeeded to the crown lands of the Habsburgs. Seizing upon a moment of legalistic uncertainty surrounding the accession, Frederick William II of Prussia (\\"the Great\\") invaded and occupied the rich and populous Bohemian crown land of Silesia (now southwest Poland). Belle Isle and his confreres saw the opportunity to neutralize Austria if France could manage the installation of an ally as Holy Roman Emperor. Making common cause with Frederick in an anti-Austrian alliance, Louis XV was persuaded to support the imperial candidacy of the Elector of Bavaria. In 1741 a French-Bavarian force embarked upon the invasion of Bohemia.For France, the war would prove an ill-fated venture. Frederick proved an unfaithful ally: no sooner had France joined the war than Prussia concluded a secret truce with the Austrians. Austria quickly occupied Bavaria and the French army was forced back behind the Rhine; Britain entered the war on the side of Austria. The year 1745 saw decisive battles in Germany, Bohemia-Moravia and the Low Countries: Bavaria was knocked out of the war at Pfaffenhofen; Frederick inflicted a crushing defeat on a pursuing Austrian force at Hohenfriedburg then secured his hold on Silesia with a follow-up victory at Kesselsdorf. The war concluded in 1748 with Prussian control of Silesia secured. The war had not been without battlefield victories for France especially for Maurice de Saxe, the victor of Fontenoy; overall, however, France \\"had gained nothing.\\"No sooner had hostilities concluded than trouble began to brew between France and Britain in their overseas colonies. Through the 1750s minor armed conflict simmered in the Indian subcontinent and in the frontier regions of the American colonies. Open war broke out in the Ohio Country in 1754; by 1756 colonial conflicts in India and the Americas had meshed and entangled with great power disputes in central Europe. By the outbreak of the Seven Years War (1756-1763), the network of alliances among the great powers of Europe had shifted. Maria Theresa, seeking a continental ally to support her effort to recover Silesia, abandoned the British alliance and effected a rapprochement with France. The British for their part looked to Prussia to help guard the security of Hanover. Sweden, Saxony and Russia allied with France and Austria. Frederick William II precipitated continental war in 1756 with a preemptive invasion of Saxony. French fortunes were mixed from the start: Frederick defeated a massive French invasion force at Rossbach in 1757 though French armies succeeded in forcing the surrender of a British army at Hastenbeck. Then in 1759 the French suffered a series of devastating defeats: two fleets were lost to the British at Lagos and Quiberon Bay, and Wolfe defeated Montcalm in Quebec. The 1763 Treaty of Paris resulted in the loss of Canada, Senegal, a handful of Caribbean islands, and all influence in India.The continental wars of 1740-1763 had by and large yielded nothing for France save defeat and humiliation, particularly at the hands of the British. Furthermore, from 1763 the state experienced continual fiscal crisis under a crushing debt burden. Attempts at reform were made: in 1749 Machault's finance ministry proposed a universal income tax. By 1753 Machault was sacked under withering opposition from the clergy and the aristocratic parliaments. In 1771 the ministry of Maupeou attempted to restructure the royal finances. To overcome the objections of the parliaments to any reform, they were broken up and their members banished to exile in a \\"veritable coup d'etat.\\" It might have succeeded but for the death of Louis XV and the accession of his son as Louis XVI in 1774; a partisan of the the aristocracy, the new king dismissed Maupeou and restored the former parliaments. Faced with the perpetual crisis of the royal treasury, however, even Louis XVI turned to a reformer for solutions, appointing Turgot in 1776 to implement physiocratic theories in the form of a general land tax. But under heavy pressure from the Parliament of Paris, Louis was forced to dismiss him.The final fiscal crisis of the ancien regime arose from the War of the American Revolution. Since 1763 France had sought revenge against Great Britain for her humiliation in the Seven Years War. The French saw their opportunity with the revolt of the American colonies against British rule. After Burgoyne's defeat at Saratoga (1777) France began to provide money, troops and naval support. Spain and Holland soon joined the effort. But French support for American independence was not only produced by a thirst for revenge. Benjamin Franklin had captured the French imagination on his embassy to Paris, his carefully calculated rustic frontiersman image dovetailing nicely with the Rousseauist tenor of the era. It was a time when even Marie Antoinette had abandoned extravagant luxuries in favor of elegant simplicity and a strange simulacrum of rural peasant life at the Petit Trianon (\\"Luxury was becoming boring\\"). As well, and somewhat ironically, men such as Lafayette and Rochambeau found it natural to take up the cause of American independence having become accustomed to hearing the language of liberty and freedom from the parliaments in their remonstrances against royal demands for greater aristocratic contribution to the national finances.With the British defeat at Yorktown in 1781, France had the satisfaction of seeing Britain humiliated by the loss of her American colonies. The finance ministry of Necker (1776-1781) had sustained the war effort through miracles of debt finance: \\"His great expertise, and the one thing he could do really well, was to borrow money.\\" Interest payments on the royal debt skyrocketed: between 1774 and 1789 the total rose from 93 million to over 300 million livres per annum. Last-ditch reforms were attempted. Colonne's land tax proposal was no more successful than Turgot's. Brienne's pitch for tax reform in 1787 was the last straw for the parliaments. They refused to register any further royal loans unless the king convened the Estates-General, a representative body preponderantly weighted towards aristocracy and clergy which had last met in 1614. In 1788 Louis XVI's move to disband the parliaments en masse provoked open revolt throughout the country. His show of backbone had come all too late. Backed into a corner he was forced to call the Estates-General for May 1789. Truly, \\"the price to be paid for American independence was a French revolution.\\"In September 1788 the Parliament of Paris registered the royal decree convening the Estates-General at Versailles in May of the following year. At the same time they provoked the first of a long series of revolutionary moments by stipulating that the procedures governing the last meeting - in 1614 - would again apply. This was to marginalize the Third Estate - one third of the Estates, and collectively one third of the vote under the old rules. The new professional classes of the Third Estate had misinterpreted the parliamentary rhetoric of individual rights as applying also to themselves. Now faced with the revealed intention of the nobility to keep them marginalized, the Third Estate found leaders and entered open revolt. The Abbe Sieyes articulated the spirit of the professional classes: \\"What is the Third Estate? Everything. What has it been heretofore? Nothing. What does it seek to be? Something.\\" In December 1788 Louis XVI decreed double representation for the Third Estate. Cobban writes, \\"at the very moment when the parliaments and noblesse thought themselves victorious, a new revolution, which was directed against them, had already begun.\\"In August 1789 the National Assembly issued the Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen. Cobban finds the key influences of this seminal document of the French Revolution not so much in Rousseau's Social Contract (\\"little read and less understood\\") or Jefferson's Declaration of Independence (\\"American precedents are obvious but not fundamental\\") as in the remonstrances of the parliaments. The Declaration replaced the concept of monarchical sovereignty with that of national sovereignty, following on the parliamentary remonstrances and the declaration of Sieyes that \\"the Third Estate is the nation.\\" Cobban sees in the Declaration, as he does in the Revolution itself, the culmination of a long process rather than the inception of a new one: \\"... in the history of ideas it belonged rather to the past than the future. The age of individual rights was not beginning but ending.\\" Furthermore in the new assertion of national sovereignty Cobban identifies the first stage of a process which would find its fulfillment in the Napoleonic period and its ultimate expression in the dictatorships of the 1930s.By year-end 1792, the revolutionary experiment with constitutional monarchy had collapsed and the revolutionary government was fighting a major war and an internal royalist revolt. The constitution of 1791 had retained Louis XVI as monarch despite his attempt to flee the country in June of that year and the open secret of his plotting with exiled aristocrats for restoration of absolutism. In April 1792 France declared war on Austria, simply because both the royalists at court and the radical party in the National Assembly, known as Brissotins after their leader Brissot or Girondists after the region from which many of them hailed, believed they had something to gain from it. For the Brissotins war with Austria might consolidate the opinion of an increasingly rebellious and ungovernable populace behind the new constitutional regime and therefore safeguard their own grip on power; for the king and his partisans a French defeat at the hands of Austria might lead to restoration of absolutist monarchy. The king's treason finally brought a revolutionary assault upon the Tuileries Palace in August 1792 and in the following month the abolition of the monarchy. Louis XVI's execution took place on the Place de la Revolution - formerly Place Louis XV - in January 1793.Maximilien Robespierre, leader of the opposition Mountain party in the National Convention, had spoken against the invasion of the Austrian Netherlands in 1792, observing presciently, \\"No one loves armed missionaries.\\" More ominously he had warned that revolutionary energies would be best spent fighting enemies closer to home. By the time of the June 1793 coup that displaced the Brissotins and brought the Committee of Public Safety to supreme power, the French state faced acute crisis. Austrian armies menaced her frontiers; a Catholic-Royalist revolt rose to a boil in the Vendee region; food shortages squeezed the restive populace. Clearly the time for strong leadership was at hand. This was found in the \\"great Committee of Public Safety\\" which ruled France from June 1793 to July 1794.Beyond our understanding of the motivations for the revolt of the Third Estate in 1788-89 Alfred Cobban would also revise our appreciation of the Committee of Public Safety's period of ascendancy. The Committee, he writes, provided \\"a government of perhaps the ablest and most determined men who have ever held power in France.\\" Of Robespierre himself, he writes that \\"the part he played in the Revolution has been reduced to nonsense and himself to a meaningless horror by the systematic blackening of his reputation after Thermidor.\\" In fact, following the coup of June 1793, \\"for the first time since 1789 France had a real government.\\" At the same time Cobban reserves all his contempt for the foot-soldiers of the Paris mob, the sans-culottes: \\"It is difficult to find anyone else in the whole history of the Revolution as completely contemptible as the leaders of the sans-culottes... professional revolutionaries who spent their time at the Section meetings, orating and denouncing in an alcoholic haze.\\"The \\"great Committee of Public Safety\\" may have saved France and rescued the Revolution but by July 1794 the excesses of the Tribunal of Paris had caught up with their orchestrator Maximilien Robespierre: he was guillotined in the revolt of Thermidor. The men who engineered his overthrow and organized the new regime of the Directory acted from no high ideals, but took for their object stability and security: \\"The Thermidoreans were united only in their fear of Robespierre... [they were] practical and limited men driven to ruthless action.\\"If the theme of the Revolutionary era is the exploitation of social forces by which one is in turn overmastered, Napoleon Bonaparte offers perhaps its best example. As challenges arose to the Directory, its leadership looked increasingly to the army, and the person of Napoleon, to guarantee security. In 1795 Bonaparte was called to Paris to suppress the revolt of Vendemiare (\\"Parisian revolts, whether of the right or left, were evidently out of date\\"). Campaigning in Italy during 1796-97 he drove the Austrians from Lombardy, then settled with them in the Treaty of Campoformio, in the process taking de facto control of French foreign policy. In 1797 he sent one of his own officers to suppress the threatened monarchist revolt of Fructidor. In 1798 he was dispatched on a rather mad empire-building scheme in Egypt which in the end redounded to his benefit: roused by the threat posed by a French army in the Middle East, Russia and the Ottoman Turks joined with the Austrians and British in the Second Coalition against Revolutionary France. Napoleon, with his fellow conspirators Talleyrand and Sieyes, could exploit this imminent threat to the republic to seize power as First Consul in 1799: \\"Then, and only then, did the logic of Bourbon absolutism finally triumph over the liberal ideals of the Constituent Assembly, and divine-right monarchy find, with Bonaparte, its historical sequel in the sovereignty of force.\\"More recent scholarship on the French Revolution has focused on the role of the mob, of women, and of the marginalized; in this respect _A History of Modern France 1715-1799_ is somewhat dated in its approach. As a precis for the study of the period, however, Cobban's work represents the best tradition of British scholarship: vast erudition worn lightly. It is a minor masterpiece of expository history, worthy of the attention of any student of the period."},{"Title":"Workouts in Intermediate Microeconomics","review":"This workbook supplements the Varian textbook, Intermediate Microeconomics.

Apparently, Antonia did not read Belloc's earlier work, she simply has a similar sensibility (no surprise, both being Catholic). Antonia is a great writer, and her treatment, being the more up-to-date (such as deciphering exactly why Louis XVI could not &quot;do the deed&quot;) deserves the nod. But Belloc is always entertaining and worth reading. Here, his judgments do stand up to the test of time; and he clearly had fun writing this rollicking biography. An overlooked gem."},{"Title":"Marie Antoinette,","review":"Belloc's erudite, opinionated and symphonically dramatic biography of the ancien regime's last, maligned queen feels like the work of a lifetime, yet it is only one of many dozens of books the author wrote during his very long and productive career. A social critic and Catholic apologist attuned to the notion of civilization in decline, Belloc is a wonderful temperamental fit with his heroine and her milieu. As you would expect, Belloc is at drawn sabers with the frivolous sophistication of the Enlightenment philosophes, and finds in the royal couple unlikely, indeed rather unintentional martyrs for what he usually calls \\"the Faith\\". His sense of the pair's underlying humanity only helps him, however, to place their acts of indecisiveness and overreach in a more alarmingly dramatic light. With every chapter one feels the underlying beat of Destiny's drum, marching us inexorably forward in the Queen's footsteps to the guillotine. Each apparent reprieve of fate, each seeming change of fortune only serves to tighten the coils even more. Belloc also has a great appreciation for the splendors of the time-- exonerating the Queen of most of the foolish exaggerations of her expenses that found such perilous belief in the minds of her subjects, he can still evoke the splendors of a ball, the rituals of the Court, the relief of an extravagance indulged, with terrific and memorable economy. That does not contradict, however, the luxurious Late Romantic template of his prose. Though Belloc, like his great friend Chesterton, is the sort of single-minded religionist who many persons, even of faith, might regard suspiciously as a \\"crank\\", his \\"Marie Antoinette\\" is, as historical writing, scrupulously scientific in its approach to evidence, though it is overlaid with a prominent, indeed firmly explicit, metaphysical agenda. For me, Belloc's assertiveness is one of his charms, and while I must firmly decline to believe some of his broad contentions, I am very happy that he has woven them into his work. There is hardly a page of \\"Marie Antoinette\\" without a substantive claim about broader humanity-- about education, economics, military affairs and their impact on events, public opinion, the theatre, the arts, the art of living, and of course on religion and philosophy-- and these are extraordinarily ponderable and noteworthy. Belloc finds in Marie Antoinette a tragic heroine for the 18th Century-- an era which, as he notes at the very beginning, was quite at odds with the very notion of tragedy-- and thus implies that Fate can choose to write us out a tragedy whether we will have it or no. In limning the life and downfall of this glittering princess, Belloc finds an Everywoman who yet remains, surprisingly, a Queen to the end."},{"Title":"Marie Antoinette,","review":"Hilaire Belloc tells the tragic tale of the storied Queen of France with style and a proper sense of wonder. Most particularly fascinating about Belloc's narrative is his detailed and clear description of the famous, or rather famous, affair of the diamond necklace. Here we see the true villians of the plot as the scheming La Motte and the nefarious Cagliostro, the dupe as the foolish Cardinal Rohan, and the quite uninvolved, but nonetheless tarnished target of the fraud, Queen Marie Antoinette. Belloc illustrates here quite clearly that the propaganda surrouning this rather absurd, and yet critical episode, emanated from Masonic London, the great enemy of thrones and order.In his preface, Belloc records his philosphy of writing history, which explains volumes about his unique style and his peerless position as a popular historian. Here, he writes thusly,\\"But undigested detail is of the very essence of academic or university history, as it is still conceived, because such an accumulation give the uninstructed reader an impression of prodigous learning in the writer. Now, in my conception of the way history should be written, not the writer but the reader comes first; it is the instruction, and even the pleasure, of the reader which should be the aim of historical writing, not the reputation of the writer for prodigious reading.\\"How remarkable! Writing in the early twentieth century, Belloc then correctly discerned a trend which has become ever so much more profound over the years. As a history undergraduate at a great American university in the third quarter of the last century, I could certainly attest that university historical writing was then so encumbered with meaningless detail and devoid of literary value as to drive the most motivated of students to other disciplines. We needed then, and still need more so now, historians in the great tradition of Hilaire Belloc.Read this excellent book. And be both enriched, hugely entertained, and well informed by the experience."},{"Title":"Marie Antoinette,","review":"This product was in great condition when I received it. Also, I received it in a shorter time then I expected."},{"Title":"God-Centered Biblical Interpretation","review":"Poythress attempts to develop a hermeneutic of Scripture that is radically God-centered--and in this book he surely succeeds. He argues convincingly that communication, meaning, language, and interpretation all involve triadic perspectives which image the Trinitarian God, as Father, Son and Holy Spirit. This was a refreshing and incredibly informative book. Although Poythress shows hints of reader-friendliness by employing imaginary dialogues (e.g., with Herman Hermeneutic and Dottie Doctrinalist), his thinking and writing are complex enough to cause the reader to go through the arguments a couple of times. Many times the readers is left wanting further elaboration, as the material provides so much potential for deeper study. In other words, each chapter could easily be turned into a book (something Poythress himself recognizes). In conclusion, I highly recommend the work and encourage others to adopt Poythress' (along with Frame's) multi-perspectival approach to theology and other disciplines and write the other books this one begs for!"},{"Title":"God-Centered Biblical Interpretation","review":"Poythress tackles the issue of Biblical hermeneutics in this book. He seeks to introduce the reader to a Trinitarian approach to interpreting the Bible. He comes up with a whole bunch of triads, which are very similar to Frame's triad in the _Doctrine of the Knowledge of God_. With the triads of purpose, imaging, etc. Poythress shows the analogical nature of human knowledge and language. Of course, the human body and psyche, I believe, are also analogically related to the Trinitarian God. Also, Poythress gets much from Kenneth L. Pikes work (and triangles).Overall, I think it is very much worthwhile. I was surprised at how *Biblical* Poythress was. He recognized equally and fairly the dangers of both postmodenrism and modernism. This is a good read if you want to know more about the Trinity. If you want a more detailed, longer, and more technical form of this, there is Poythress' *The Supremcy of God in Interpretation* (available, I think, from WTS [215-886-099]).The reason that I only give it 4 stars is because I found the discussions among Dottie Doctrinalist, Amy Affermationist, Oliver Objectivist, etc. very annoying. They were unnecessary, I think. But, you may find them helpfull. Yet another reason that I didn't quite enjoy the book was that *every* diagram in it was 2D. Squares, triangles, circles, they are all 2D. The world, God's creation, is always 3 dimentional! 2D objects feel unreal and less personal. Well, if these type of things don't bother you, you may find it to be a five star book."},{"Title":"God-Centered Biblical Interpretation","review":"This book is written in very dense academic prose. I wouldn't recommend it, especially to the layperson.Poythress needs to understand that his audience may not have several upper-level degrees like he does. He's obviously smart, but has the usual downfall of academic types: the inability to convey complex ideas in an easy-to-grasp way.I find the most well-presented theological books can convey valuable ideas to 3 audiences: the non-Christian, the simple Christian, and the learned Christian. I can't see how the first two groups would even remotely get the book. Which is too bad, the subject of interpretation/hermeneutics should be much more widely understood in the church.There are some interesting points, but I wish he would define his terms better. He throws around philosophical terms as if people should already understand them.Also, when he presents Scripture verses, he doesn't really bother to explain how he gets and idea from a verse. He just assumes that anyone can see a verse supports his idea.I really wanted to like this book, but I'll be looking for a better book on the subject."},{"Title":"The Gospel According to John: 2 Volume Set: Anchor Bible","review":"I don't want to say much, but was surprised no one had reviewed it yet. This is a great commentary, and as some of the older Anchor Bible Commentaries can vary in detail, Brown offers a good mix of critical notes and discussion. I would definitely recommend it."},{"Title":"The Gospel According to John: 2 Volume Set: Anchor Bible","review":"Professor Raymond E. Brown is at times presented by publishers as the dean\\" of the New Testament scholarship. It means this commentary is as work of in depth analyses of the scholar who has also written superb introductions to New testament literature, as well as classic reference books on Messiah' birth and death, also published by Anchor Yale Bible, as is the case with this volume. It is \\"a must literature\\" for biblical scholars, theologians in general, bible and theology students but also readers that are interested in a comprehensive information about the life and knowledge of the Jesus from Nazareth, developed and transposed by the early Christian circle we tend to call the johannine church. This is first of the two books that reveal all the crucial question in johannine theology and proposes the outlook of the Gospel given by professor Brown. The content of the Word, given by Jesus of Nazareth, his biography and theological and literary way of its transmission is analysed from the macro level, to a level of the verse and vocabulary.Forth Gospel is far from being \\"just\\" spiritualized gospel, departing from historicity of the Jesus' life reports provided by synoptic Gospels. Its rich layers of theological understanding of Jesus and His mission are certainly not a result of departure and compromise with historical validity of it. In explaining why is that the case, Raymond Brown was and still is one of the best.

It just seemed to me like the author was trying to hard at times. I had hoped that the physics (though used for great allegorical effect) would be better integrated into the plot, as Mawer did with genetics in Mendel's Dwarf. Relativity, etc., is really fascinating stuff-- the author should have perhaps given us more credit for being able to understand it beyond the most simple explanations. I also felt that the story just went on to long. After the critical events, the book really lost narrative and emotional momentum. Despite these criticisms, I did find the book a touching, worthwhile story. The disappointment comes because it seemed like the book could have been so much more."},{"Title":"Mrs. Einstein: A Novel","review":"If you like &quot;What if...?&quot; kinds of books (&quot;What if... Einstein's illegitimate daughter was as smart as her father?&quot;) then you'll enjoy this thoroughly. What happened to Einstein's daughter Lieserl remains a mystery, but Anna McGrail's work of fiction brings Lieserl Einstein to life.Let's just say that most people deal with unresolved abandonment issues a little differently than the protagonist. It made me wonder &quot;What if&quot; Lieserl had had a good therapist....There is a lot of &quot;Thelma &amp; Louise&quot; interplay between Lieserl and her lifelong friend Maja; the two always seem to be on the run and changing their identities. Maja, the expert on mascara and haircurling, also happens to be pretty handy with a Mauser pistol.For those who know the history of physics, there is a lot of name-dropping involved (e.g. &quot;A physicist called Feynman drafted me in to work on one of the endless calculations....&quot;)The story is by turns a comedy, a scientific detective story, a story about the Holocaust, and a revenge drama.... It's a hodgepodge that has a little something for everyone.

I've read the other reviews in this section and count myself fortunate for not taking the book too seriously. Perhaps that is why I so thoroughly enjoyed it. The author has created a marvelous central character in Lieserl. She is exquisitely drawn, the matrix of her emotions and motivations crystal clear without being tedious. There are two stories running in tandem here; the apocryphal story of Einstein's daughter and her integral involvement in the development of the atom bomb, and the story of this extraordinary woman's personal development through soul-numbing deprivation and loss. And it's funny. The &quot;science&quot; of the first story is beautifully foiled by the spirituality of the second. Sure we've seen this story before, though not lately, and as far as I know NEVER with a woman as the central character. I do not hesitate to recommend this book with the following caveat; if you take it too seriously you may throw it down in disgust within the first 50 pages. I have a feeling the author would agree."},{"Title":"Mrs. Einstein: A Novel","review":"This novel joins Michael Ondaatje's &quot;The English Patient&quot; in raising important questions about the development of nuclear weapons and the decision made to use them at the conclusion of World War II. It is time for our literature to begin examining these issues. We have countless fictional works based on the holocaust in Germany, and certainly, we need these works. We need to understand what happened, and how it could have happened. Too often, however, American and British authors find the answer all too easily. They simply create a fictional universe in which the German people share a passion for sadism carried to extremes and an average IQ of about 50. So much of this literature becomes formulaic, and finally, silly. You do not have to scratch &quot;Winds of War&quot; too deeply to discover Colonel Clink. Meanwhile, we have our own unpardonable act, which we have not until recently brought into critical focus. Ondaatje lulls his readers' attention away from the horrors of war in the charmed atmosphere of the abandoned hospital where the English patient lays. This idyll shatters suddenly with the sapper's undeniable utterance. &quot;You would not have dropped this weapon on a white people.&quot; McGrail's novel moves in a similar way. Einstein's abandoned, illegitimate daughter Lieserl slowly ceases to be a human character, and becomes instead that aspect of human intellect that made the bomb possible. She is the mathematics. She has no morals, no religion, no values. She is not impeded by national boundaries or physical limitations. She is a force, supposedly driven by revenge, but that motive cannot be examined too closely. In fact, Lieserl does not work as a character with human motivations, and limitations. The reader has to accept her as a type of abstraction or the story becomes entirely implausible. This woman can change her identity and nationality by the simple act of changing her name. She and her companion sail across boundaries and easily assimilate into the most closed communities. In the context of the American project to create the bomb, Lieserl becomes the cloud that obscures the light of ethical considerations from the teams of scientists working on the project. She is the abstract knowledge, blameless yet responsible. After the unthinkable occurs, however, Lieserl has a moment of self-awareness. She suddenly realizes that once they had the bomb, the politicians, ignorant of its actual power, incapable of understanding anything close to its destructiveness, would certainly use it, and use it proudly. The novel brings home the fact that some of those working on the project knew exactly what they were unleashing on the world. We need to ask ourselves, &quot;What can they have been thinking? Why did they pursue this unwelcome knowledge? Did they really imagine that the politicians would refrain from using it?&quot; Once the moment of revelation is past, however, the novel does not hold together. McGrail tries to return her character to the mundane considerations of domestic life, and she really cannot do that. Lieserl's has to remain figurative in order to be believable. This is really a minor problem, however. The development of this interesting figure for a mysterious aspect of the human intellect rewards the reader amply."},{"Title":"Mrs. Einstein: A Novel","review":"If you're in the right mood for it, this story will just pick you up and carry you along. It covers a whole century, several continents, an ever-changing cast of characters, and all takes place just at the edges of major historical events.

It's amazing that this book was written from only a few factual events of Einstein's daughter's existence. But then....that's fiction. I thought the &quot;scientific&quot; thread running through the book was too fundamental: pre-physics 101. I had the feeling that the author assumed I wasn't capable of grasping something a little heavier.The reason for Lieserl's complelling desire to destroy a father she never met, was not brought out as strongly as her desire for that revenge. Something more important than &quot;she felt abandoned&quot; would have been nice. She sacrificed a husband, her children, and herself for some undefined reason. I guess that would make her worse than the father she sought to &quot;destroy.&quot;The parallel of Maja and she to the chaos/order of the universe was interesting. Maja had the ability to control the chaos and create a certain order in their own little cosmos. While interminably depressed Lieser! l simply accepted herself as a constant without the ability to change, Maja utilized everything available to alter the &quot;inevitable.&quot; In many ways Maja was a more interesting and complex character. She was both pragmatic in home and education matters, yet she was a progressive female aware of her powers. The ending truly lacked credabilty. Lieserl lived entirely too long and the book should have ended 30 pages earlier.I was engrossed while reading it, yet the book lacked a real story line. The author, however, is a poetic writer.

EINSTEIN is certainly one of the most compelling and unusual novels of the past several years. Missing it would be a great loss. The scientific discussions of gravity and light, of relativity, and of nuclear fission are expertly woven into the thematic fabric of the novel, spun delicately into the order/chaos images that flow through the book. This, my friends, is an epic, moving from turn-of-the century Hungary through WWI, the influenza of 1918, the rise of the Third Reich, WWII and finally to Los Alamos. How can that be &quot;boring&quot; even from the pen of the most pedestrian writer? Anna McGrail has not only created a convincing and heartbreaking character in Leiserl, the illegitimate daughter of Albert Einstein, but developed one of the most original and fascinating friendships between two women (between Leiserl and her one-time German teacher and life-long confidente, the amazing Maja) in all of contemporary fiction. A true discovery, both this gifted writer and her unforgettable piece of work."},{"Title":"Mrs. Einstein: A Novel","review":"This book is so boring and predictable. The author's insertion of scientific knowledge is rather dull and elementary. It does not flow well with the story, she just puts an idea from general relativity theory in the middle of a paragraph without any intro or reference to it. This is a story of a mad woman who lives her life for the sole purpose of revenge and hatred toward her father, but the author does not really even clarifies the source of such strong emotions. This book is written very poorly, it's a mere anthology of facts, some made up story and lots of basic and painfully elementary scientific knowledge of the author."},{"Title":"Mrs. Einstein: A Novel","review":"Already in the UK, from where I review, this is a beautifully written, if challenging book. But its more your (America's) history than mine. (A similar treatment of Alan Turing would be welcome).For those not farmilliar with the astonishing events which led to the Bomb, its morality, its characters and the science, this will faithfully take you through that journey.For those already familiar it challenges the accepted historical record through believable construction. It was only on the thirdish reading (to check out if the allagories were consistent) that I became convinced that the principles of quantum and relativistic physics are embodied in the characters and their actions. If this was accidental it is good fortune, if meant its exceptional writing.It works as a story and as an alagory.

She has created well-defined characters, and spun out their odyssey briskly. And she can evoke the feel of bygone times and places. It would seem that the ingredients for a superior novel are at hand.But it doesn't quite jell--except possibly as a female parable. As mainstream fiction, &quot;Mrs. Einstein&quot; shows its superstructure and premises too nakedly, and fails to develop a life of its own. For some reviewers, this flaw seems to work as a kind of magic realism, and to enhance the book's power. But the story and style are as romantic as they are realistic, and the &quot;magic&quot; can get grating at times, particularly at the end, with its sudsy sentimentalism worthy of a new YaYa Sisterhood.

It's a great story.The downside was the abrupt ending. I wanted more of an ending that explained a little more of what was on their road ahead. I was interested in them. Morgan is a good story teller, however his style is very matter of fact. He's not overly descpritive, or really very descriptive at all. His writing style is simple and not swarthy at all. (Ok, sometimes I like a little swarth- it's what makes me like the beautiful prose of Kristin Kimball in The Dirty Life, or writers like Jhumpa Lairi, Amy Bloom.) However, it works for this story. Morgan tells us a lot about the characters, and I could imagine the mystery of the backdrop.

Just brilliant!That is all."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"I have always said that the first year of marriage is always the worst. The men I know say the opposite is true. So I had my doubts that a man could accurately express a woman's thoughts and feelings about that often highly romanticized first year of married life. Well, Morgan hits the mark. The prose is beautiful and real. You must listen to this story. Jill Hill's reading is authentic. I don't know where she's from but she sounds like the North Carolina mountains. No exaggerations--her pronunciations are right on."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"This book, despite having to get used to the grammar, was a quick and memorable read.

The hardships that people had to go thru during this time period are unbelievable and really makes you appreciate the life we lead in the 21 century. Very well written and with a good story line to get yourself embedded into. I read several chapters in a night because I could not put it down. I strongly reccommend this book for people that love a story about people that tried to survive on the farm in the early 1900s. Such a young couple that survived with love and determination."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"That's correct, the title of this says I hate to read. However, this summer I am forcing myself to do so while I'm on break from school. Gap Creek was the first book I chose to read, and I'm very glad that I did so. The book was very well written, and captured me from the beginning (I read it in less than 2 days). Since I was born, raised, and still live in rural Appalachia, it was nice to see a book that basically laid out what we're like, without being completely degrading. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to read about &quot;the good ole days.&quot; It is filled with endless examples of how hard life was, but only made me more thankful for what we have today. I also enjoyed the presence of the power of God and the church in the book, which has been a vital part of this country since its formation, that people seem to be forgetting about these days. All in all, it was a very good book."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"Against my better judgement, I decided to use up some of my time reading this book. I received the book as a gift from someone I respect and the author is local, so I thought I would give it a read. Unfortunately, the author's work lived up to what I think must be typical of Oprah's Book Club works. It is extremely maudlin and has clunky and obvious plot devices. The author has some technical skill, and that is what merits the 2-star rating. Amazingly, this version actually has an appendix with suggested areas for discussion. This is quite pretentious.Don't waste your time with this one. Read some Faulkner or Sherwood Anderson and give this one to your grandmother."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL STORY OF SOUTHERN MOUNTAIN PEOPLE IN N/S CAROLINA.

It seemed so short of what it could have been.The use of language was creative and realistic, seemed to drop us right in the middle of Gap Creek. And the events were touching as well, life and death, love and hate.Its an enjoyable read, but seems to be lacking the emotional depth that would be needed to make this one of my favorites. Don't expect to find yourself feeling overly sympathetic or in touch with the characters lives."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"Wow, I was really suprised by this novel. First, it's one of the best books Oprah has recommended in a long time. Second, I read it in almost one sitting. I was up all night and a book has not caused me to do that in a long time. Robert Morgan is an excellent poet and this is the first fiction that I've read by him. Not only is the protagonist a fully realized character, she's one that you want to believe it. This is a very well-written novel, with not 1 word too many. The author maintains focus, voice, point-of-view, and tone throughout. It's a definate buy, highly recommended."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"A very sad, depressing book. Granted it makes you appreciate the things you have in life more but who needs to be brought down by someone's continuous hardships.

Read a novel to escape, be enlightened, and dream."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"Hard to put this book down. Julie Harmon was so strong and determined.

Very different taste!"},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"I have not read a book that completely had me hooked by the 2nd page. It was incredible. I looked forward to returning to Gap Creek nightly.I wanted to reach out to Julie and hug her. She's one of the strongest characters I've ever read about. To endure such heartache and at such a young age and to keep overcoming it. She was extraordinary. What a strong woman she was.I thought Hank finally pitched in when taking care of Delia. I was surprised at his care and concern since he had very little concern throughout the book for his wife.Robert Morgan describes child birth in such vivid detail, it completely brought back all memories to me. I was amazed by his insight into a woman's world.Robert Morgan is phenominal. This book was amazing, enjoyable, eye opening and just plain good!"},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"If you're not accustomed to hard work and disappointments, you couldn't possibly relate to this story. I anticipated a typical &quot;Oprah&quot; book choice that would include oppression and I was not disappointed. However, combine the captivating writing style of Robert Morgan, his knowledge of the period, and his ability to convey that detail, and you have a book that will keep you turning pages. I found myself becoming Julie's personal cheering section, thinking things just had to get better for her and her husband. She had such a matter-of-fact attitude (work needs done, you do it) and returned to her faith to gain inner peace and happiness. Yes, she lost patience occasionally, but in her place, I would have cracked, not just whined for a short while. Her young husband learned at the patient, gentle hands of Julie, how to grow in stature and faith. I make no comment on his earlier methods of anger management, but it seems by the end of the novel, both parties had matured. Therefore, even though this was a &quot;usual&quot; Oprah pick, it left me glad to have read the book. Julie is a roll model to those who think they have it hard, or have had life deal some hard blows to them."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"I found this book to be quite over-rated. The writing was simplistic and lacking in depth. Many people consider Hemingway's writing style simplistic, but there was depth of meaning beneath his unadorned manner of writing. Oprah has performed a valuable service for the public by encouraging reading through her book club. However, this book is like a good TV show. It may be 'good', but in the end it's still only TV. Also, I have a problem with the accuracy of the author's depiction of turn of the century Appalachia. He displays some knowledge of the area (poke is a local term for sack or bag), but I felt overall many details were suspect and lacking in complete credibility. For readers seeking a touching and more accurate picture of the time and locale, I suggest THE EDUCATION OF LITTLE TREE by Forrest Carter. His account is true and the writing is exceptional, in a sublime way. It was a 1991 Abby Award recipient."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"I love this book. Julie is the type of woman with qualities we should all do well to aspire too. Hard-working, forgiving, honest, and compassionate.We are all so very spoiled and lucky to be living in the age we do now. Life a hundred years ago wasn't about finding yourself, acquiring fancy novelties, or even about happiness. It was about survival. Hank and Julie barely knew one another when they got married. In today's world they would probably have been ill suited to another. They suffer tremendous hardships but remain committed to another.A simple story with a strong truth. I will read more by Robert Morgan."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"Gap Creek was one of those hard to put down books and certainly one that left me wanting to know more about Hank and Julie.

I only hope that Mr. Morgan continues the story of Hank and Julie's journey."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"Just as Arthur Golden in &quot;Memoirs of a Geisha&quot; articulates a female protagonist with honesty and grace, so does Robert Morgan in &quot;Gap Creek.&quot; This story shares life on the frontier at the turn of the nineteenth century. The protagonist Julie Harmon tells of the difficulties and challenges of that life with detail and the edge of reality that makes &quot;Little House on Prairie&quot; seem like a slice of Hollywood. The beauty of the story, for me, was Julie's wisdom. While she was uneducated and had a limited vocabulary--she had profound insights and was able to work through massive grief, lack of communication with her husband, and family dynamics. Despite all of the challenges the story is full of humility and grace. One of the prayers early in the story articulates this well, \\"Lord, for what we are about to receive make us truly thankful, and for the struggles of this life make us strong and worthy, and for the beauties of the world make us humble and grateful.&quot;(p.39) Words we can live by in this century."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"In Gap Creek, Robert Morgan speaks TRUE to the mountain spirit: in tone, attitude, language, and behavior, this is an authentic capturing of the spirit of a &quot;real&quot; woman (not beautiful, brilliant, etc.) in a real era. It's one of the very few novels in which poor southern mountain characters are neither &quot;glamorized&quot; (as being the most virtuous or most villanous, the hardest living, hardest drinking, most put-upon by natural and human forces) nor denigrated. These characters do not all make moonshine or play a dulcimber."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"I don't usually read Oprah's book suggestions but after hearing the subject matter of this book, I had to try it. I felt like I had stepped into my own family history. My Grandparents married in 1916 in Pike County, Kentucky with $5, an iron bedsted and a cast iron skillet. My grandmother made their mattress out of corn shucks. Nine months after their wedding, at the age of 17, she had the first of 13 children, alone. I have heard stories all my life about how, when times got hard, my Grandfather would pace the floor and say, &quot;What are we going to do? What are we going to do?&quot; And my Grandmother would say, &quot;We'll find a way. We always do.&quot; And she did. She was the strength and center of the family, even though she only went to 2nd grade. Now her children and grandchildren are doctors, nurses, teachers, coaches and college professors ... and I am a teacher and librarian. Like Julie in this novel, she sometimes learned lessons the hard way, but what she learned, she never forgot. Morgan's characters are true and very real and hard to forget. This book made me appreciate the kitchen sink, my refrigerator, the furnace ... and all the everyday things we always take for granted. But most of all, this novel reminded my how much I appreciate my grandparents, and how honored I feel that I was able to know and love them. People had to be strong to survive then. Today, we forget what real strength is. A wondrous read."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"I read this book in two sittings. I found it easy to read and the story line easy to follow. It was a story of the hardship, heartbreaks and sorrows of a young Appalachian couple in the early 1900's. It is also a story of their triumphs and survival. The end of the story will leave you wanting to continue reading about this couple. I would recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"At first, I found this book to be uplifting. Beautifully written, descriptive,yet not too wordy. I was in the mountains with Julie and was ready to gut a hog myself (okay, maybe a fish). Then, I soon came to realize that her life was not getting any easier, ever! It's an easy read and you'll finish quickly, but you won't feel so good once you are done. I found it all rather depressing in the end."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"I was disappointed that this book came to an end. A wonderfully strong story about love and marrage. I felt full of energy everytime I picked this book up -- Julie is such a strong character -- she made me feel guilty for not having as much passion for my work. A wonderful read!"},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"In all my life I have never read such a gripping first chapter of a novel. Morgan thrusts the reader right into mountain life a century ago. From page one I could tell that Gap Creek was going to be full of surprises. I was glad that Julie was portrayed as a strong woman but not as some kind of unrealisitc feminist. Morgan made Julie human by making her hard-working and smart but also gullible and sensitive to pleasing her husband. It was refreshing to read about a woman who has real feminine feelings for once. I'm so tired of modern day literature creating liberated women who have no human qualities. I have to admit that three quarters of the way through the book I began to get a little annoyed because nothing good happened to the characters. But as I read further I noticed a spiritual transition take place within Julie and Hank. No matter what happened to them they always had their hope and the couple seemed to find peace. Hopefully, Morgan will write a sequel to Gap Creek. The ending leaves plenty of possibilites for a sequel. I would love to read more about Julie and Hank."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"I really love books that give you characters you can almost reach out and touch they are so real.

You keep hoping for the clinch to come, but it never does."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"This is a beautifully written story about a very young couple's life in Georgia and South Carolina Appalachia during the late 19th century. It tells a simple story spanning a period of only about 2 years. The detail of their exhaustive efforts to survive as well as their mundane tasks of everyday life did not leave me bored as I would have expected, but left me wanting more with every page. I felt an extreme sense of respect for my ancestors, as life as we know it now, is a piece of cake compared to life 100 years ago.I truly enjoyed learning all of the details of cooking a meal with no running water, no gas stove, no coffee maker or microwave. The details about the surrounding beauty of the mountains in their natural state astounded me. I learned so much I cannot even say .... whoever heard of creesie greens, sugartit and konkajohn?A wonderful novel that left me with much to think about and much to be thankful for... funny I finished reading it just before Thanksgiving."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"I think this book .. the way it was written was simple and easy which keeps the story moving and keeps my interest. Nothing is in the way of a good story. The story made me see what families went through 100 years ago. I appreciate what I have more now that I read this book. Also .. this book made me laugh and cry and just simply try harder as a wife in my marriage because of what Julie had to go through in hers. I find myself thinking about the story long after I finished reading it. That is a story in my eyes worth 5 stars and then some!"},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"I have a high tolerance for suffering in books, but Gap Creek will test anyone's limit for pain and hardship. Set in North and then South Carolina, it tells the story of 17 year old Julie Harmon's first year of marriage to 18 year old Hank Richards at the turn of the 20th century. Poverty, hardship, and austerity prevail over their lives. The hardship doesn't subside until they've been victims of fire, flood, malnutrition, and deceit. I kept hoping the tide would turn for them, but there would be no tangible positive changes to their lives; if anything, Julie and Hank grow to accept their fate. Their decision to become members of the local church, where they find kindness and support from the Preacher Gibbs and fellow members, figures strongly in their ability to cope with their hardscrabble life. Hank, who at first shows less mettle than Julie, gains maturity and responsibilty after the couple suffers a devastating loss. Julie finds redemption in the catharsis of hard physical labor. That child could clean her way to heaven! While it's a well written book, Gap Creek tested my tolerance for pain and suffering and left me emotionally devastated. Warning: Do not read this book while you are the least bit depressed; it'll have little to give in the way of hope."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"I enjoyed reading this book. It reminds me of stories from my grandparent's, and things that needed to be done to survive hard times. He accurately described about slaughtering hogs, rendering lard, and dressing chickens, things that are still done today in rural areas. Julie was an interesting character, with much strength and determination. Although she was uneducated, she had much wisdom and faith, and was able to work through her many challenges. It was written in such a way that you could feel yourself experiencing the emotions Julie was feeling. I hope there will be a sequel to it."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"This first-person tale of a young backwoods farm woman and her husband around the turn of the century is a well written slice-of-life -- as it might have been.Morgan's ear for dialect and turn of phrase make for interesting reading as do his detail in describing the hard-wearing daily life of the mountain poor in the late 1800's. But it's a depressing tale, filled with one one woe after another, and not enough plot development and progression in story or character. For some, the skill and quality of the writing will be enough, but for those who prefer character development and plot, read elsewhere."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"The subtitle &quot;Story of a Marriage&quot; is misleading. This is the story of the FIRST YEAR of a marriage, and what a disatrous first year it was. Very beautiful descriptions of the mountain country of North and South Carolina. Well depicted insights into human nature and human emotion. Aesthetically beautiful and evocative descriptions of mother nature using language of the people where the story is set. I found the series of misfortunes that befall the newlyweds a little too much. Especially where they give their money and property away, not just once, but twice. The descriptions of slaughtering hogs and dressing turkeys and chickens were a little more information than I need. Julie, the narrator, scrubs a lot of floors too. Julie's descriptions of lovemaking with her new husband were pleasant, not lurid, with humor too, especially when their bed collapses in earshot of their old man landlord. I found it confusing that Hank, the husband, was so capable a person when first introduced and became so inept as the story progressed. This seemed somewhat incongruous. He had little resilience to come back from the troubles that visited."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"Thought I was buying a book on life in Appalachia--you know, hunting, skinning, trapping, moonshining, etc. Had some of that, but it was so much more.

That speaks volumes coming from a man who thought he'd be reading about coon hunting and such."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"I listened to an unabridged audio version of this book. In every conversation between 2 people, the author found it necessary to use phrases \\"I said\\", \\"he said\\", \\"Hank said\\". I found this to be most irritating. Its very easy to follow a conversation between 2 people and to constantly add that type of phrase after each spoken sentence drove me nuts. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone unless they really wanted to read something depressing. The descriptions were much more graphic than they needed to be, from her brother's death right through the hog killing."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"Gap Creek! Don't go there! Bad things happen! And, if you go with Julie Richards, expect the worst! Everyone dies: first her brother (while she's carrying him!), then her father, then Mr. Pendergast, then the cow, then the chickens, then HER BABY! Then, there's the filthy house she has to keep for Mr. Pendergast, the grease fire in the kitchen, and the flood which almost claims her and her husband Hank. THEN, there's Hank, fooling around with her no-good younger sister Caroline! Not to mention a high critical mother-in-law who has to have the last word and is deluded that she is behaving in a &quot;Christian&quot; manner! To top it off, there's starvation and a husband who can't/won't get a job! The subtitle says it's the story of a marriage. Oh dear! The convent is looking better and better! As a result of reading this book, I will NEVER complain about cooking or cleaning for the rest of my life! Don't read it!"},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"Set 100 years ago near the NC/SC border in the Appalachians, Gap Creek is both a lesson in and a celebration of pure work. Julie and Hank touched my soul in their efforts simply to eat, stay sane, and to love. The story is simply told, without flowery language and with a definite let's-not-play-with-the-reader attitude. Julie and Hank's story is so powerful it can stand alone as an inspiring glimpse into a world where, without labor and faith, you die. I can't wait to read the rest of Robert Morgan's work."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"What strikes me about Gap Creek after finishing it is how forgettable it is. Sure when you are reading it it seems like a nice little story lovingly told, but by the time you finish it you kind of sit back and think okay, what's next? The story that develops from Julie's witnessing her brother's death to her marriage to Hank covers familiar territory. We know it was tough back then - especially for women - and we know that natural disaster can have devastating effects, but what we don't know or could know more about - beliefs, community, marriage - is left unchartered by author Robert Morgan. He introduces religion into the story but never examines its real place or meaning to the people. I wanted to know what gave them such faith! His writing is at times quite beautiful but at other times verges on pedestrian. His use of accent fails dismally and his story repeats itself. I understand that repetition is a literary device that some authors use but here Morgan seems to use it to let the readers know that men do make mistakes too. It's almost as if he realised that perhaps he was going to alienate some readers by introducing Julie's mistake in handing over money and having Hank take his frustrations out on her, so he decided to have Hank do exactly the same thing. This is I admit a &quot;nice&quot; book but one cannot help but wonder what someone with an ability to push boundaries would have done with this material. This is Julie's story that should have been one with an edge, as it is Robert Morgan's Gap Creek is Julie's story that seems to just fade in with every other coming-of-age, marital relationship story ever written."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"I very much enjoyed Gap Creek. The change in the characters throughout the book is inspiring and the growing relationship between husband and wife is encouraging. I loved reading a story where people grow together rather than apart and make the right choices."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"I agree with a previous reviewer, who found that while Julie Harmon's character was well-developed, the other characters remain rather flat. I enjoyed the first-person narrative style of writing, and found the story to be basically engaging and well-written. However, it essentially left me wanting more, feeling rather unfulfilled in the sense that the book feels incomplete. I'd like to know more about the husband-wife relationship between Julie and Hank. Was it really that detached? Or could there have been more? I actually would welcome a sequel, as I'd like to know what happened after their move back to where they started."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"I enjoyed Gap Creek, it was an easy read. At times I wanted to cry for Julie, and shake some sense into Hank and tell him to shout from the mountain tops what a wonderful woman he had!

At the end it left me wanting to know more."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"The first test of strength for the main character is one of the strongest narrative hooks I have read in an extremely long time. This is a slice-of-life novel focusing on two years in the life of Julie, a young woman who has to learn the hard way what it actually means to be a real woman. The characters are full of flaws--as is most of humanity. In the end, the reader realizes that s/he has invested much in this character and her small family. No wonder Oprah chose this book as a book club selection."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"Actually, there is not all that much not to like about this novel. The writing is extremely well done, excellent character developement, flowing prose and a story well told and of hope. The author certainly did his research on this one and pretty well nailed the background of the time and place. I am not a great fan of The O's book club selections, but certainly had to agree with her on this one. Unlike the \\"Spotlight Reviewer\\" here, I do see why all the fuss was made over this work. It is good, simple as that. Perhaps I am not jaded enough or lack a certain level of sophistication, who knows. Now don't get me wrong, not everyone enjoys the same thing, the same genre, etc. but most folks can and do appreciate good writing and a good story by a good story teller. With this book we have that.

First of all, the cover states that it's \\"A story of a marriage.\\" This is incorrect. This book is rather a story of a young woman in a marriage. To say that the story is about a marriage should mean that it involves, equally, the wife and husband as partners, sharing and experiencing life. This book, however, takes a one-sided look at the wife, while only lightly brushing upon the husband with pure feminist stereotypes. The man is written as wishy-washy, abusive, simple, pouting and, in times of crisis, weak. The woman, however, is the highly evolved, courageous, strong, decisive, knows-what's-best leader of the family. It's really too bad. The story provides a lot of visual and emotional description, and really does put you into the time. I just wish that the characters were more original. I suppose that's what I receive for failing to notice the \\"Oprah's Book Club\\" seal besmirching the cover...."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"If you only read one book this winter this is the one!

Just when you would think that Julie (the main charecter) would give up, she would see the importance in overcoming obsticals. Julie has been through a lot in her 17-18 years of life, in only the begining of the novel she has had to become the &quot;head of the household.&quot; I had thought the ending of the story was going to end up to be quite depressing, but instead it ended in hope and faith in starting over, just as they had done when she and Hank (her husband) were first married... No matter how or what I say about this book it would do no justice. This is a must read. I highly recommend you read it and make your own judgement on it. It's worth the time. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"Like many others here, I read this because it was an &quot;Oprah book.&quot; I'll give the author credit for detailed descriptions of what the characters had to do to survive ... killing hogs, giving birth unassisted, tending burns and laying out the dead, etc. ... but this book is strongly lacking in any emotional connection to its characters. Not to sound like an acting coach, but &quot;where is the motivation?&quot; If Morgan's intent was to show Julie to be a simple, hard-working, salt-of-the-earth young woman, he succeeded (for me) in portraying only the &quot;simple&quot; part of that equation. She was nothing more than an automaton, getting through each day by moving from one chore to the next. Where was her heart through all this, where was her soul? Vivid descriptions, one-dimensional characters, weak dialogue. I can only give this book 2 stars."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"The very linear first-person account of the hard stuff of mountain living for a poor, young woman is reality-driven. It ain't always pretty, in fact seldom is. But there is a finely-honed beauty about the honest, pragmatic account of the hardship, triumphs and tragedies that seem interwoven into the &quot;gettin' through&quot; of every day. We may not embrace or understand the mentality that accepts the domestic-violence-followed-by-love-making, but the truth of the matter is as openly explored as is the absence of grace in butchering a hog. While the imperfect grammar of the narrator might be a distraction in a less carefully-crafted piece, it enhances the depth of this piece. One can only wonder, too, at the research of a male writer who can write with such stark authenticity about the childbirth experience. I reckon this ain't beach reading. It is an opportunity to become enthralled with the lives of some memorable characters about whom one begins to care.....even during times when reading must be delayed to attend to realities of ones own life - like earning a livin' and stuff."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"This is the first time I decided to try one of Oprah's recommendations. I was dissapointed. Yes, the story kept moving. That was one pleasurable thing. The author did an admiral job in connecting the reader to the characters. It didn't take long drawn out descriptions to identify the core of each player's personality. This helped the book be a very fast read. However, it was too simple a read. I enjoy a little more challenging, deeper, thought provoking novel. When it ended, my only thought was...&quot;that's it?&quot; I was not impressed."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"Gap Creek is a great story, but it's too heavy on tragedy, hardship, and melodrama. It ends on a slight uplift toward hope, but nothing in the previous too-many pages leads readers to believe things will EVER work out for Julie and Hank. There's some beautiful writing in these pages, but man, this author needs to lighten up a little on the pathos. What is it with these Oprah books that seem to celebrate misery?"},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"I wasn't sure if I would like this book. With its title being &quot;Gap Creek, a story of a marriage&quot;. Hmmm, how mundane? Not really! This book has a very strong character in Julie. I found myself respecting her and her decisions and feeling discomfort in her agonies. She was above it all (as a woman)...really, she could chop wood to heat a house, carry her sick brother for miles, slaughter a pig (quite a gruesome scene by the way) and even deliver her own child by herself. Yet, she has real emotions and letdowns that you can really relate to.The book, being set in the time period that it is, makes the lives of these mountain people excruciatingly difficult, and you find yourself being grateful for the local &quot;Piggly Wiggly&quot; and modern medicines. There are a couple scenes that are quite gritty...for example the slaughtered pig scene (as aforementioned). I am not an animal activist mind you, but this was like 4 pages of pig guts and gore...yuk.All in all, I really found myself enjoying the book, I read it quickly and didn't want to put it down. I was reading the Bluest Eye by Toni Morrison at the same time, and had to put that one down for a day or so...ugh! I found this book much more entertaining and enjoyable."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"I agree with another reviewer that there really wasn't a story in this novel. I appreciated (can't say I enjoyed them) the depictions of mountain life at the turn of the century and there were some passages that I thought were well written, but the plot went nowhere. When I got over half way through the book and realized that nothing had really happened to the characters (and wasn't going to, based on the remaining number of pages in the book), I just skimmed the last few chapters and called it a day. There is no story, no real growth (unless you count Hank learning not to lose his temper character growth), and no emotional payback for the litany of calamities that happen to Julie. I don't see the point of this book - and I really don't see how it ended up on Oprah's booklist. I don't recommend it."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"I had been eyeing this book for months before fnally getting my hands on it and reading. I have to say it was extremely simple reading; I zipped thru the pages quickly. I am not sure if we are supposed to believe that Julie, a young woman who was assuming a role in her family that was not congruent with the times, turned into the little homemaker wife with Hank.At times I didn't believe Julie would have thought the way she did in her situations, but at the same time I did feel for her. She was so young and faced many challenges. She annoyed me in her ways with Hank, making excuses for his behavior which is so typical of women that are abused. And then she proved her strength again with birthing alone.If you are looking for a light read, I recommend this. Just beware you may not believe a lot of what is told."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"I was really touched by this book.

On the whole though, I loved the book, especially the savory descriptions of Julie's old fashioned cooking.

It is the story of Julie Harman, a young Appalachian woman, in a time before any kind of modern conveniences were available, who somehow survives despite gnawing hunger. As the story opens, Julie recounts how she \\"saw it all\\" and then goes on to describe her witness to an awful death of a sibling. Things stay ugly as her beloved Dad gets sick and dies and she takes over all the physical labor required for her mothers and sisters to survive. It is a cold story about a girl who feels as though the only reason anyone loves her is because she works hard. It is the story of constant struggle, poor decisions, and little joy. Although the Robert Morgan skillfully captures Julie's backward country talk and her stoicism, what is his point? Julie ends up learning that she must trust no one. Those who appear to love, turn out to betray, abuse, or ignore her. Her newly married handsome husband turns out to be a hotheaded loser. Even her renewed association with a church community does not really help her when she needs it the most- a starving flood victim in full term pregnancy. Any reader who concludes that she finds religion and it gives her peace has missed the mark. Most readers will have a sense of relief as the couple leaves Gap Creek. As the newlyweds proceed to the next destination, some readers may hope good things will happen for them, but most of us know otherwise. For me, this book is reason #3 why I will avoid Oprah's Book Club Selections in the future."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"I'm afraid I agree with the review of September 10, 2001 &quot;Reviewer: p.burton from Chesapeake, VA&quot;.

Eventually they became irritating and I had to finish listening to it in small bits over a few days.The problem was compounded by the reader's same monotone reading of the &quot;I/he/she said&quot; words. They were almost detached from the rest of the words. I also had a little trouble relating to or believing Julie's description of her feelings, etc. I think the problem might be a male author trying to write from a female perspective.

It's beautifully written and I enjoyed it more so the second time around ~~ especially since I had gotten married since the first time I read it. However, like a lot of Oprah's other selections, it is rather depressing. Ok, maybe depressing is the wrong word to use. It is very realistic look at life in the early 1900s when life is still tough and hard, especially for mountainfolks who have no money for medicines and knowledge.Julie is a hardworking woman who meets Hank and agrees to marry him. They moved to Gap Creek where Hank got a job in a mill. They rented a house with Mr. Pendergast where Julie's job is to take care of the house and their landlord. Through a series of unfortunate mishaps, Mr. Pendergast dies, Hank loses his job and Julie gets pregnant. Together, the naive couple struggle to survive the harsh winter ~~ where a huge flood destroyed most of their food crops that they had saved for winter ~~ and together, they find an inner strength they didn't know they had. They basically grew up, as most newlyweds do when they leave home for the first time.It is a realistic look at life. Marriage is not about roses and sweet dreams coming true. It really is a marriage of two minds melding together in spite of obstacles placed in their ways. This is a marriage about survival. They needed one another to survive that first year. And together, they will beat the odds for as long as it takes.I enjoyed it ~~ even the rather descriptive details about farm life and having to butcher your own animals for meals. However, that time wasn't too long ago that we haven't forgotten it. It's a rich look into life that once was and reminds us of how good we have it now.1-30-04"},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"&quot;The horse stepped sideways and he hollered,'Whoa there'.&quot; (page 35) Would that I, instead of the horse, had obeyed Hank's command at this point in the book.

One of the main reasons I liked this book is the prose. The prose is delightful; the reason might be because the author is also a poet. For instance, Julie's description of her first night after the wedding is colorful: \\"All the colors started running through my head in the dark. Purples and greens and yellows and black. They blended into each other and poured over each other.\\"The only portions I disliked were details of the gruesome tasks that Julie has to perform, and, I just skipped the instructions on butchering a hog.

I came away feeling a strange sort of kinship with Julie (I want to meet her!) Wow, what a woman! She is remarkable, in a quiet sort of way, and although she is uneducated and inarticulate, it didn't take long for her to earn my respect.Again, this is not your usual cozy &quot;pleasure&quot; book, but it is one of the most extraordinary novels I have ever read.

I am from a part of South Carolina very close to Caesar's Head, and, as our power goes out semi-regularly, I can identify with both his descriptions of the mountains' beauty and the work involved in a non-mechanized lifestyle. Morgan portrays the area and the time period realistically and vividly, but he does not attempt to sensationalize either his subject or his characters. He depicts Southerners as strong, self-reliant people with compassion and insight, a welcome change from the usual &quot;ignorant redneck hick&quot; stereotype that has pervaded literature in the past. I am very glad that Oprah chose this book for her club because I feel it represents the South, and particularly the Appalachian culture, in a positive light...but it does not idealize it, either. I found this novel deceptively simple; it is very easy to miss its subtle power if one attempts to skim the pages. This is not particularly light reading...if you want an &quot;easy read,&quot; get a comic book. This is an eye-opening account of a life hewn out of the wilderness, of humanity's fragility, and of the power of faith.

The main character Julie was a true feminist. She never quit or gave up on anything,whether it was &quot;fair&quot; or not, hard or easy. She rarely worried about the opinions of others. She did what needed to be done. Instead of running back home to momma or just running off to look for an easier life, she kept her commitments. She actually understood what commitment meant and was willing to give whatever it took, no limits. She was a truly grounded woman and always approached situations with her faith, her heart and a big dose of reality. She spent little time worrying on things that she couldn't change. She had seen life and death and knew that life continued on no matter what happened, and there was no sense in just giving up and quitting. Julie was a person who lived in the present moment and did the very best she could each day. She never had her head in the clouds dreaming, but she enjoyed and experienced life to it's absolute totality.

In my opinion, most of Oprah's recent picks have been misses. But this one grabbed me right off and kept me reading. No, it is not a wonderful, happy story. Rural life at the turn of the 20th century rarely was. But Julie was to be admired. She was strong, determined and honest. Hank was a spoiled, but charming little boy at the beginning of the book, but grew into a loving man at the end. It was a pleasure to read about their first year of marriage - how they went from being a &quot;he&quot; and a &quot;she&quot; to being an &quot;US.&quot; Mr. Morgan, will we have the pleasure of looking in on Julie and Hank's marriage again?"},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"This book is all about the reality of living. Life is hard. Life does not get easier. However like the main person in this book, Julie, we do get wiser. And in our wisdom we are better able to deal with the hand god haa delt to us. Julie is a very hard worker. She inspires you to work hard in your own life. We see her take care of her mother , father and sisters in the beginning. Then she marries for love but also in the hopes that things may get easier. She finds out marriage is the hardest job she will ever have. As many of us find after we married our husbands they have FLAWS. Julie finds this too. Her husband looses his job, had a mad flirtation with her sister, is abusive and weak. She has to carry him . But instead of giving up and going home (witch she considers) she decides to disect her husbands personality and learn to accept him as is. We see in the book she is the back bone of her home until she has her child. She must then allow her husband to BECOME a man. She becomes ill and HE is forced to do all the work around the house and try to save his baby. He does indeed grow into his potential. After yet another tradgedy ( one of many in the book) guess what this YOUNG amazing couple does ? They go on with thier lives. They are a testament to the human spirit. We really can endure more then we think. In the book the author makes it clear: FAITH, PATIENCE, ENDURANCE, ACCEPTANCE, PERSERVERANCE AND LOVE truelly can conquer all. If you come away from this book uninspired then you have missed out! Julie is a hero for all."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"Age provides the vision I use to see today. My grand children don't know the depth of poverty but hear the descriptions of my family's 12 X 16 canvas covered wall tent -- my childhood's tiny mountain home. Robert Morgan's novel makes it all stand out in my memory once more. To read &quot;Gap Creek&quot; is like coming home again for the first time. The story line is delivered with precision, emotion and speaks well of strength of character. If you are looking for realistic fiction, appreciate the struggles of America's hard working women and men who have strong faith and courage and often -- with hungry eyes, dream of something better -- read this book. Growing up we never knew another class of people put us just below (them) as Julie who just went about the business of surviving. I highly recommend reading another book Amazon.com lists. Unlike Morgan's novel, LIFE WITH NOAH is nonfiction. It tells about a turn-of-the-century Adirondack Mountain hermit Noah John Rondeau, who escaped civilization for a life in the wilds. There he befriended a young lad, Richard Smith. The true story is written from Smith's perspective. It is a story of friendship in elegant common man's prose. A story of joy, of rediscovering one's values, of faith, survival and adventure in the wilds of America's oldest mountains, living with -- and truly appreciating nature. This book will not collect dust. I find myself continually rereading portions. I have yet to find more spirited nature writing from the heart."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"This book was a superb book! I read it in a few hours &amp; ended up wishing it would go on. Julie was a very strong woman who led a hard life. I found myself feeling very fortunate. I would recommend this to anyone who thinks things are rough. We often do not realize how lucky we are in this day &amp; age."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"Narrated by the main character Julie, the story shows us the first year of a young couples marriage and the difficult situations they find themselves in and how they learn to cope. Overall, I enjoyed the book. It was a fast read and there was always something interesting going on. It never got bogged down in sappy insight or rambling prose. There was no real resolution though and I found the drastic turn-around of some of the characters (i.e. Hank and Ma Richards) to seem somewhat rushed and a bit too &quot;neat&quot;. Robert Morgan did a pretty good job of getting inside a womans head to tell this tale. However, the romantic situations (the first kiss and marriage bed scenes), in my opinion, did nothing for the story. I found it unbelievable that two very young people could be that uninhibited or sure of themselves. I highly doubt that this 17 year old virgin would be given to psychedelic visions."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"Gap Creek is the second book I have read by Robert Morgan and I although it isn't my usual style of &quot;pleasure reading&quot; I absolutly enjoyed it. I am a wife and mother myself, and my reading time is just before bed when no one is tugging at me, and during my day I would find my self waiting impatiently for bed time so I could travel back to Gap Creek and visit with Julie and Hank... This book is one of the best. The reader is going through the same emotions as the characters with every turn of the page. I not only felt, but Mr Morgan, with his unique style, allowed me to see this story play out so vividly. I laughed at the town drunk, I hated Ma Richards along with Julie, and mourned the losses and truimphed the gains. Gap Creek is an experience, you will not soon forget. It is such a beautiful true to life story without sugar coating, but mostly it is a triumph about doing what is right.. Gap Creek is pleasing to the heart."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"I have come to look forward to Oprah's book choices every month - she has introduced me to so many talented new novelists. However, Gap Creek is not one of her better choices. While the main character, Julie, and particularly her deep faith and the comfort she finds in hard work, seems very real, none of the other characters are at all developed. Particularly empty is Julie's husband Hank, and the relationship between the two of them - I was looking forward to seeing this fleshed out, after all, the book is subtitled &quot;Story of a Marriage&quot; - but the interactions between husband and wife were very stiff and unengaging. At times the details about food, cleaning, etc.-- while enormously interesting -- threaten to overwhelm the plot structure. I think that Morgan did an enormous amount of fascinating research, but that he did not quite manage to write the book he had hoped to."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"Of all the great books for Oprah to select, why this one? To discuss a book in the setting of a bookclub there must be something to discuss. In this book there is virtually nothing to discuss. I read this book in about three hours. My nine year old perhaps would have enjoyed it more than I did as it is about at her reading level. Most of Oprah's picks I find to be on the depressing side but after reading &quot;Gap Creek&quot; I felt nothing but anger that I had wasted my money on the book. I knew no more of impoverished lives in turn of the century Appalachia when I finished the book as I did when I began. Truly one of her worst picks to date."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"The novel opens with Julie's younger brother having a seizure. This sets the scene for what is to come, you keep thinking will things get better but of course, they never do. Consequently, we have a death by burning, a solo pregnancy, more infant death, bloody descriptions of animal slaughter, absolutely freezing sub zero weather, starvation, and a massive flood that nearly wipes everything away. It seems as though Morgaan is intent to make us experience the whole gamut of human experience and suffering! He seems also to be implying that the poor of this world are destined to suffer and lead a life of constant struggle and hardship. Gap Creek is still a page turner though as you wonder whether Julie and Hank are ever going to make sense and achieve some kind of order out of the madness and chaos surrounding them. Morgan offers us some elegant prose, although at times the dialogue becomes turgid, stilted and meanders. Also, the plot mechanics tended to grind about three quarters of the way through as Julie and Hank discover their &quot;spiritualism&quot;. Morgan, however, sounds as though he has dome is research, especally regarding the descriptions of food etc.; you know the prose is effective when you salivate while reading. He also has an incredible appreciation for the world of the Appalachian high country, although each day is a battle to keep food in your belly, Julie still has time to reflect and admire the beauty of the natural world around her - witness her scenic walks to the top of Gap Creek. Certainly not the best of the Oprah Book Club picks but good nonetheless."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"In my opinion, I feel that some reviewers missed the point. On the surface this is a tale of hardships suffered by a young woman at the turn of the century(1900). I read this book in one &quot;sitting&quot; due mostly to the excellent story telling abilities of Mr. Morgan. The almost sing-song poetic quality of prose to which I connected on so many levels. This is more than a story of a young woman who faces death, hard work, hunger, hard times. It is a story of tolerance, perseverance, strength &amp; determination to continue when others would give in. It is the story of all stong women who face diversity and through love and loyalty and self-pride continue to &quot;prod&quot; on through what life presents. She was the &quot;glue&quot; in her marriage which is so very often the case in even this new turn of the century. Recognizing the faults, immaturity and lack of ambition in her spouse, but pushing him and helping him in a way to save his self-esteem. To gently push him the way he really wanted to go, but was unable to because of his upbringing. This is a wonderful story, not just a story of turn of the century Appalacia but a story with depth and messages of tolerance, love, and the value of loyalty to us &quot;modern&quot; women. Don't misconstrue the grammer of the times to indicate lack of intelligence, because the women of this novel exhibited intelligence on many, many levels. Mr. Morgan has captured us well."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"I just recently finished reading Gap Creek, and though it was an easy read, I never actually liked the story. I could easily tell that it was a man writing Julie's feeling and thoughts. I never found her to be real. Her senses, especially smell, were well described. When it came to descriptions of her feeling I feel they were superfical and minimal. Falling in love is something girls, especially 17 year old girls, spend all day thinking about, but Julie's feelings were never really shared with us. Her life was difficult and she is a hard worker - that is brought out over and over again - though we all knew that from the first page. I wish Morgan spend more time inside her head and her feelings and less time saying the same things over again. At the end of the story I still did not really like Julie or Hank or their marriage. I will not be reading any more of Morgan's books."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"This was one of the most satisfying reads I've had in a long time. I was completely transported back to Gap Creek, and became so absorbed in the vivid descriptions of lifestyle and emotion that the author presented.Detail is the selling point of this book.

Actually, I'm hoping for a sequel so we can see how life unfolds for Julie and Hank. If they lived through everything they did in such a short period of time, I have a feeling that nothing will keep them down, especially since it seemed that Hank matured quite a lot toward the end of the book. Almost made me feel quilty for using my microwave to heat a cup of tea......"},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"and it definetly left this reader wanting to know more of Julie and Hank's gritty, realistic life in the Carolina mountains at the turn of the 20th century. In fact, if there was ever a book perfect for a part two, this is it! Mr. Morgan has written a haunting novel that will stay with you long after you have put it down. It left me in awe of the strength it took to survive such poverty and disaster as befalls this young married couple. Sounds like a depressing book, huh? Yep. But there is so much to admire here that, amazingly, you don't go away feeling blue. I read a lot and this is one of the best. (And I would have added that last star if I could have had more). But wait! I guess that only proves this is a great book. Please, Mr. Morgan, write a sequel. And maybe you can throw in at least one lucky break for Julie and Hank?"},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"Morgan's writing style is understated, but poignant, saved from grimness by gritty honesty. The setting is severe poverty, at the beginning of the 20th century in the rural Carolinas. Julie is a strong and hardworking, responsible and mostly obedient teenager - not anything at all like our version of a teenager. Poverty permeates this story of a year in the melancholy marriage of a mountain girl of 17 and her 18 year old husband. Floods, fires, near starvation, joblessness, hard work, victimization, grit and the pleasures and responsibilities of marriage. Mr. Morgan really crawls into the head of a woman in this tale, better than any man this reader has EVER read. Julie is believable, uneducated but smart, with a simple faith - though hopelessness laces through this story from beginning to end. There is little laughter or light in this peek into the past, but simplicity, austerity and wisdom that is enriching."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"A pessimist, it has been said, is actually a realist in wolf's clothing and Morgan's Gap Creek symbolically drives the point home with an overarching account of a troubled young woman living in the wilds of Appalachia and struggling to find true enlightment. Morgan's use of symbolism is often very heavy-handed. The slaughtering of the pigs in the barn while the bankers simultaneously foreclosed on the farm is one such example of how Morgan hammers his points home in an extreme manner. His characters, other than Julie Harmon, also happen to be as wooden as a 2x4. These shortcomings however are washed away by powerful waves of beautiful prose that eventually drown the reader in a literary dreamscape of neglected forests and bottomless ponds."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"A great book if you enjoy yawning....

I really want to know what happened to her and her family."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"If it weren't for bad luck, they'd have no luck at all. I read the entire book thinking things would have to get better, but they never did. This narrative is told by Julie, who watches her baby brother die. After nursing her father through a very long illness (presumably TB), he dies also. She marries the first man who courts her, and after the wedding, she and her husband move closer to his work. In exchange for room and board, Julie cooks and cleans for the unpleasant old man who owns the house they share with him. The old man dies after getting severely burned in a grease fire. Hank loses his job and there's a baby on the way. A terrible rain storm causes the creek to rise and the house gets flooded. The flood destroys a large portion of their food supply in the cellar, the corn crib and the smokehouse. It knocks over the privy. The cow dies. Julie gets a fever right after delivering the baby prematurely. She has no milk. The baby hangs on for a time, but is too weak to survive. Just when the hens might start laying more eggs a weasel gets into the chicken house and kills them all. The the old man's stepfamily sends a lawyer to collect back rent. No one cares that Julie and Hank repaired and restored the house and outbuildings after the flood. They leave the cabin with only what they brought with them and start walking back to where they came from. There is no actual ending to this book. It just stops. It's as if the author forgot to finish it, or the publisher left out the last chapter. This is a book about the harsh realities of rural life in 1899. There is very little joy, only drudgery day in and day out. They just keep slogging along, enduring one tragedy after another. By the time I finished reading this book I was worn out."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"I know it was supposed to be indicative of the person's dialect and lack of education, but listening to the first person account of a life told through short, choppy, simple sentences got old, real fast. I will, however, give major kudos to Jill Hill (the reader)! She did a fantastic job of making me feel like I was actually listening to Julie (the protagonist) telling her story. So, for that aspect alone, I would recommend the audio version.

Set in the Carolina Mountains at the turn of the 20th century, GAP CREEK explores the trials and tribulations of the young protagonist, Julie, striving for survival in the midst of poverty and hardship. After their marriage Julie and Hank move to Gap Creek where they possess a desire to live a good life together, but what awaits them is far from their hopes and dreams. They face hunger and uncertainty while battling the demons of Mother Nature. Julie also faces Hanks degrading attitude and temper after he loses his job and cannot find another. Just when things look bleak and you think it cannot get worse Julie finds out she is pregnant. Life on Gap Creek is rough and trying to say the least.While reading GAP CREEK I really emphasized with Julie and constantly wished she would get a break from her troubles. She had lived such a hard life in her young age. Along with Julie, all the other characters are realistic and well developed, especially Mr. Pendercast who I would love to read more of his life. Morgan takes the reader back in history to a time before the invention of modern technology. The descriptions of hard labor are sorrowful and make me greater appreciate the comforts of the 21st century. However, despite this book's downtrodden plot and dire circumstances I wouldn't describe it as being a depressing read. Rather I feel enlightenment in the strength of Julie. Her continuing struggle for perseverance is certainly admirable and gave me inspiration.I enjoyed reading GAP CREEK, and would recommend it to others."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"Anyone who grew up with all the luxuries of the 20th century are beyond compression of Julies trials.

I liked every part; there wasn't one part in this book that left me disapointed. I felt like I could relate to Julie. It might be because we are similar in age. the fact that she never gave up on her marriage with Hank shows a strong character. There were times when Hank was being impossible but Julie found ways to put up with him. When she persuaded Hank to reconsider committing suicide I was impressed. I liked how the author, Robert Morgan, explains in great detail how to slaughter and gut a hog. Also how to dip and kill a chicken, grease pig fat, it explains all the uses of a pig, it even explains how to pick out the perfect Christmas tree. I thought it was strange how Julie used hard work and labor to deal with her brother's and father's death. She even uses the fact that giving birth is work to get through it. I really liked when Julie had the vision of her father when she had the fever. I think that seeing her father gave her a boost of confidence and it was just like a renewal for her. Hank's moods were bringing her down majorly. the vision proved that her father was there throughout her marriage and her problems.

I respect Oprah and occasionally watch her show, and have read some good books she recommended, however, Oprah is NOT a God, contrary to what many people believe.Gap Creek is the very simplistic story of the first year of the marriage between Julie and Hank Richards. Julie, having had a hard youth, seeing her little brother die in her arms and having to take care of her sick father, believes her life will finally change for the better when she meets the &quot;handsome&quot; Hank. (the way she thinks about him and other issues sounds much more like a man trying to write as a woman ) Unfortunately, her new life in Gap Creek brings many hardships. Poverty and several disasters don't make life very easy for Julie. However, a miserable poor life does not guarantee an interesting story as this book shows.Gap Creek reads to me like an attempt at writing from a young uneducated girl's point of view, and that is exactly what it sounds like, an attempt. The fact that the writer is well educated and a man shines through easily. Julie's thoughts reactions and words are not very credible at all. She is very much the stereotypical uneducated farm girl, who is in fact supposed to be very wise. Her husband Hank is supposed to be a big and strong yet insecure man who loves her, yet hits her and tries to make her feel worthless and get into fights, but merely out of his own insecurities. However, Hank is not at all a loveable figure to the reader, he is more a pathetic wife beater type of person instead. Even when something difficult happens and Hank shows his sensitive side, he does not become much more attractive.The story of stereotypical characters who have to deal with some things many people have to deal with and especially had to in those days, just does not make a good book. The book is very mediocre, the characters all either unrealistic or stereotypical, and the story is just a little too simplistic. Unless you are in your 90's and had a similar life and enjoy reminiscing about the hardships of the past, or you are such a big Oprah fan that you insist on reading every book she has read, I would not bothering spending your money on this.Instead, if you want to read one of the good books Oprah recommended, try &quot;She's Come Undone&quot; or &quot;I Know This Much Is True&quot;, both by Wally Lamb. If you're interested in more simplistic, but at least heartwarming, realistic stories of families who have to deal with all sorts of issues, try reading the Little House On The Prairie books. They may be for children, but they are a fantastic read, very realistic, and have characters you cannot but sympathize with. These books contain the charm and realism Gap Creek misses."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"I put off reading this book for my book club until the last minute - I feared it would be derivative of &quot;Cold Mountain&quot; and didn't want to ruin my memory of that fine book. Turns out, about the only similarity was that it was set in the mountains of Western North Carolina and it depicts country people going about their business of survival. Oh yes, and there's a hard working female character named Julie that resembles &quot;CM's&quot; Ruby.Morgan has received praise for a tour de force. It's a good book and has earned him a seat in the respected author category, but at no time did I feel like I was reading greatness. While many readers object to the excessive hardships reaped on Julie, I didn't have a problem with that - sometimes life just runs in some pretty bad spells. But I did have real problems believing that Julie was only 17 in the face of all that hardship. Her patience and tactical position in a confusing marriage was just too mature for a teenager - and smacked of modern day pop psychology - it was all his mother's fault. She didn't fight with her husband because he expected her to since that's how his mother acted. She ignored him to gain power. He was depressed so she tried to build up his masculinity and therefore make life more pleasant for herself. This is just too much for me to believe in one so young. I also didn't feel real deep, tender love coming from her to him, mostly just astoundingly good sex (although the bit where he hits her and calls her a heifer and she gets excited was just plain disappointing to read - C'mon Morgan!) She had plenty of normal teenage resentment to all the work her family expected of her but then suddenly &quot;poof&quot; it would vanish and she'd be generous and good natured again and ready to pull another load of wood out of the frozen woods. Only at rare moments with her sister Lou did you get a sense of her being a normal, dreaming young girl. No doubt she worked hard, but in those times in her class she was the norm and her pampered, vain (and characatured) youngest sister the unusual one.Her marriage bothered me the most, and not because after the wedding her wonderful, broad shouldered husband became angry and depressed and sullen (complete with a hint of unfaithful flirting with the younger sister.) The cardboard suitor turned into the cardboard oaf. What didn't sit right was that he all of a sudden switched and turned into a really decent, loving, gentle, compassionate man with no warning. We're talking Poster Husband here! The birth of their child, with Julie's near death child-bed fever removing her from the nurture loop, suddenly galvanized him into being loving and responsible and peaceable. Why, now he could even make his harpy of a mother hold her tongue and turn sweet and kind and every woman's dream mother-in-law. All of his frustrated, simmering anger was dissipated. Wow! I would have been more comfortable with Hank being portrayed as we humans are at our best - a continuum of mistakes and learning and more mistakes and more learning. The sudden cure didn't ring true.While others comment that the book just ended and they were disappointed, I actually thought the conclusion was the best part of the book, even if it was a bit of a wrap. Julie and Hank had their year away from home, fraught with hardship in order to learn all their hard lessons and were now returning to family and their future. Sort of an intensive internship of adulthood and they know that they can survive. Hank would now be employable once away from Gap Creek, there would be plenty of support and community, and the young couple were now truly coupled and loving (remember that last lovemaking scene before they left the house?) And Julie's new pregnancy was just plain old life affirming! No, in the end I saw them climbing that mountain with the peak within reach and from thereon out, an easy descent.So while I appear to tear up the character depiction, I did like the book. I understood her feeling of numb tiredness when the baby died (although I saw the baby dying plot coming at conception.) I could picture the rooms and the clothing and the smells and the natural scenery very clearly. I felt the treacherous flood waters and her cold, overworked hands. My knees hurt from all the floor scrubbing (and I secretly wished Julie would come on over to my house sometime - I'd give her some jam in return.) And call me strange, but the most disturbing, damn &quot;life ain't fair&quot; moment for me was when the cow died. That was just too much for a body to bear!"},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"When I handled this book I couldn't put it down, but again, why would I?

It reads like an instruction manual for how to live in the mountains at the turn of the last century. Particularly annoying was the overuse of he said, she said, especially when only two people were talking and it was obvious who said what. Hank was a verbally abusive bully. Julie didn't know him well enough before marrying him to see this side of him. I couldn't bear him and finally just skipped through pages to see how the book ended."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"I agree with the many other reviewers who criticized this book for the simplistic dialogue where every short sentence of dialogue ends with \\"I/he/she said.\\" This really didn't work for me, especially in audio format; perhaps it is less noticeable when you are reading text on a page, I don't know. You'd think that someone in the book at some point might \\"exclaim\\" or \\"whisper\\" a sentence, but apparently not. Just line after line of \\"I said\\" then \\"she said\\" then \\"I said\\" etc. Also, the voice actor for the audiobook has a slight lisp that makes the \\"s\\" sound more syllabant, so the \\"I/he/she said\\" are that much more grating to my ears. In other audio books I've enjoyed, the actor just uses different intonations for the different character voices so that you know who is speaking which line during a dialogue. This makes for a much more natural flow to the conversation and you can lose yourself in the story rather than constantly being jarred by the sentence structure. They should really have used this technique when they recorded this audio book. I get the whole notion of using minimalist writing style and/or trying to make the words match the vernacular of a character, but there needs to be more artistry behind such a technique."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"The story was okay, but it kept getting slowed down by overly-detailed descriptions of the household tasks. For example, when Julie did the laundry it went on-and-on-and-on about gathering the clothes, fetching the water, boiling the water, shaving the soap, stirring the clothes, etc. Then the details of butchering the hog went on for pages.

Deaths, natural disasters and mean-spirited opportunists combine in such formidable force that the young couple is almost beaten before they've started.In times like these, Julie and Hank often wonder what it's all worth...but with time, they learn just how much they do need and love one another, and the fledgling life together they're nourishing."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"As a person who didn't grow up in the United States and also as a woman I have to say I was both educated and amazed by this beautifull and insightful work of art. Thank you Mr. Morgan!The characters in this book are so fully dementionl I felt I knew them personally! All of the events move tightly together and one situation leads to another without any gap or disruptions. Mr. Morgan must have a vast knowledge of the vegetations that grow in North and south Carolina to be able to name them and describe their characteristics in such a real and interesting way. The writer also has a deep knowledge of the way of life and the mentality of peole living in that period and place. Yet for me what was most capturing thing about this book was that the book is narrated by a young woman and is about mostly her life and views. The most ordinary tasks of a day to day life of a woman who lived a century ago in North and South Carolina is painstakingly discribed by Mr. Morgan that makes me believe that each one of us, even me, add so much to life, not only during our life but also after our death and that we have the ability to influence and inspire other people that may in so many ways be more advanced than us.

Not worth the time."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"I just finished the book and I would give it 4 1/2 stars, but they don't have it on here, so I rounded down. I enjoyed the beginning, and the end, but grew tired of the book during the middle section. I hated the way Hank made everything out to be Julie's fault. We was a very spoiled, and unlikable man. I think he felt threatend when Julie tried to help or would speak her mind.When Caroline was visiting, the feeling that something was going to happen between her and Hank stuck with me. Which is another thing I held against Hank. He didn't have to like her attentions so much. It wasn't till after they joined the church that Hank became a better man.The most emotional part of the book was when Julie lost the baby. I felt so sorry after all that Hank and Ma Richard was doing to try and save Delia.When they were being kicked out of their home, I kept thinking this can't be happening, but I was happy with the ending. And I think that it was a good beginning for the new life they were embarking on. I would recommend this book as a good read."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"This book was not one I was eager to read from the beginning, but I was in a hurry, stuck for a book, and thought an Oprah pick might be uplifting, or at the very least, interesting. I got through the first few chapters all right, and even though the main character displays the utmost determination, I just could not get into the story. It was depressing, however realistic seeming, incredibly uninspiring, and, did I already say depressing? Okay, so it is well written, and it brings the reader to the world of despair and poverty, not to mention, starvation. If you are looking for a book that is not uplifting or fast-paced, this might interest you. It truly is a book about survival. If you, like myself, read for compelling stories, captivating characters, and a book you will not want to put down -- I would recommend looking elsewhere. This author surely has potential -- this was just too heartbreaking for me."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"This fine novel written by Robert Morgan displays the hardships of living in the Appalachian high country during the end of the 20th century. The powerful beginning was a tearjerker but made the reader realize the family's struggle to survive. It is easy for some to take this life for granted but when reading this novel, it makes the reader count his blessings.This story begins with the death of Julie's little brother Masenier. Julie soon becomes the &quot;man of the house&quot; when her father becomes ill in the sense that she does all of the physical work in the forest. This is where Julie of 17 meets who soon is to become her husband Hank. Soon after their marriage, they find a house in the valley of Gap Creek. From here the first year of hank and Julie's marriage is played out.Julie prevails over the natural disasters, tragedies, physical boundaries, and culture differences during the strenuous first year of her marriage. Along with hank losing his job and Mr. Pentegast's, their landlord, death, Julie faces domestic abuse, a fire, and a flood. During all this time, Julie becomes pregnant with her first child. Although this is all physical hardship, Julie manages to find a mental escape once and a while to free her mind to find the strength to withstand this marriage.This novel is the work of a genius. He portrays the life of an average family beautifully in every aspect of the book. There is never a predictable moment as the author writes of the serious life and trials a young girl goes through, to some extent, even today. Julie is a true heroine and fights the elements to withstand the life of a young wife in the Appalachian highlands and the hardships of survival mentally and physically."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"With gripping storytelling and a strong and endearing main character, Robert Morgan's Gap Creek doesn't just tell the reader about the 1800's, it draws the reader into the pages of a world that is very different yet psychologically identical to the modern day.The protagonist, Julie Harmon, is an extremely hard worker with a patient and sensitive soul. During Julie's struggle to maintain her marriage and her home, almost any reader can identify with her complicated feelings towards other people: common emotions of hatred,responsibility, anxiety and love. It is through the first person narration that Robert Morgan so vividly illustrates her thoughts.Gap Creek allows readers of any age to fully appreciate modern technology. The sweat-provoking and often gruesome tasks of American life were just routine for growing families at the turn of the century. Even medicines and doctors weren't efficient enough to save people from most diseases, and childbirth as displayed in the book through amazing prose was much more complicated and painful than it is today.Robert Morgan gives his characters a growing insight to life, and death. While Julie and her husband strive to understand and appreciate each other, they also strive to find themselves religiously. They use prayer and forgiveness to their advantage as their spirituality grows, although like a lot of people it takes many moments of doubt before their true beliefs set in.Gap Creek is an eternal record of human nature. All of the elements of life: the struggles against the wilderness, clashing personalities between different people, and the happiness and hardships of starting a life with a spouse in a new place allow Gap Creek to grasp the attention of anyone fascinated with the lifestyles of the late 1800's, and anyone fascinated with life in general."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"GAP CREEK is the well-written Appalachian tale of a period in the life of Julie Harmon Richards. Julie has always been the hard worker in her mountain family and from that work, she's gained the confidence and strength to assure her that she can survive difficult times.She marries and leaves her family to start a new life with husband, Hank. These two people are very young and very poor, two qualities which prove to be detrimental during a harsh and poverty-ridden period in American history. Yet they are honest and willing to work hard to achieve an honorable, independent life.But they hadn't anticipated that they'd be faced with an avalanche of problems which include con artists, thievery, natural distasters, and unassisted childbirth. There comes a time when they don't think they can go on, but then Julie's internal strength emerges and their determination returns.GAP CREEK is made even more interesting because it is written as a woman, but by a man. This author is able to convey a female's feelings in a realistic manner. This book's events are depressing, but it's a good solid read."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"Robert Morgan beautifully captured the mind and soul of this 17 year old girl. I admired her grit and waited for her to be rewarded on some level for all that she was able to survive. I became dismayed when she didn't seem to learn from life's harsh lessons. Somehow I believed a girl who could manage so well on so little would have clawed her way out of that depressing mire."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"I enjoy complex stories and this one is definately not. The idea of the story is quite good. A young woman in a time period set approximately one hundred years ago getting married and on her own for the first time. Encountering a lot of HARD times along the way seemed like a really good base for a novel, but did not pull through as a quick page turner for me. The dialog was really simple, which was a good effect for the setting, but the characters seemed very shallow and plain. Not too much development there. No schemes or abundances of intelligence. And the thing I enjoyed the least about it was the unhealthy relationship of the newlyweds. I have read much better, much more complex and interesting books."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"In Gap Creek, Robert Morgan speaks TRUE to the mountain spirit: in tone, attitude, language, and behavior, this is an authentic capturing of the spirit of a &quot;real&quot; woman (not beautiful, brilliant, etc.) in a real era. It's one of the very few novels in which poor southern mountain characters are neither &quot;glamorized&quot; (as being the most virtuous or most villanous, the hardest living, hardest drinking, most put-upon by natural and human forces) nor denigrated. These characters do not all make moonshine or play a dulcimber."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"This is the first time I decided to try one of Oprah's recommendations. I was dissapointed. Yes, the story kept moving. That was one pleasurable thing. The author did an admiral job in connecting the reader to the characters. It didn't take long drawn out descriptions to identify the core of each player's personality. This helped the book be a very fast read. However, it was too simple a read. I enjoy a little more challenging, deeper, thought provoking novel. When it ended, my only thought was...&quot;that's it?&quot; I was not impressed."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"I'm not a professional book reviewer, but this book was terrible. The characters are just empty shells. It bumps along from one scene to another without any reason. I had a huge problem with the portrayal of domestic violence as foreplay. He belts her a couple of times and it makes her want to have sex with him? It just amazed me that the author would place this young woman into a terribly abusive relationship and then describe how glorious her sex-life was with her sniveling, gutless husband. I guess sex sells...at least it sold the legions of people who only buy what Oprah tells them to buy. This was the 1st and last book I'll buy based on Oprah's opinions. Shame on me."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"I have just finished Gap Creek and felt compelled to write a review. I read it because of Oprah selecting it and it had very good reviews. I read a lot of books and I can't for the life of me understand why this one was chosen by Oprah or why the reviews were so good! It didn't seem to have any real plot and all it talked about was hard work and food. I don't know what I missed. I like it when Oprah selects books that have the potential for a real discussion of ideas and opinions like Map of the World. I just finished reading The Pact by Jodi Picoult and thought it ws wonderful and had so much more to think about it. I would love to see Oprah select that or Barbara Kingsolver's Pigs in Heaven. Oh well, just my opinion. Will check back to see how others feel. Happy reading to all!"},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"Even though Gap Creek was based in the time period of the 1800's with horse drawn wagons, no electricity, or living in the woods, I could relate with Julie. The details the author goes into, anyone can feel Julie's pain. Gap Creek is one of my favorite novels because it shows the inner strength, physically and mentally, of a woman. Julie struggles throughout the entire novel, yet she still manages to survive. The situations she endures were tough and life altering, like when she gives birth to her daughter Delia alone on the kitchen floor or when her little brother dies in her arms while trying to get him home. Though gruesome and graphic at times, Gap Creek is an enjoyable, heartfelt novel."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"I wish I could get my money back for buying this hard cover. This is an unbelievably simple story of turn-of-the-century, mountain life for a poor young couple. The characters have no depth and most of the book is taken up with descriptions of scenery and the how-to of doing chores (killing hogs, chopping wood etc.) down on the farm. There is no meat to any of the characters, so you don't develop any empathy for them or their daily struggles to survive. I also wonder how they could have subtitled this book &quot;The Story of a Marriage&quot; considering it only covers the first year of this couple's marriage. I bought it expecting to read about a relationship that spanned at least 20 years. There is absolutely no insight in to what makes these characters tick, and really no developing plot lines to make the story interesting. The language is simple, typeface large, and lots of white space on the pages -- this book only took me 6 rides on the commuter train to finish -- kind of disappointing considering the price. As with other recent Oprah picks, I think she just chose it because the main female character, Julie, proves how tough she is by cooking and cleaning and scavenging for food while her lazy husband, who can't hold down a job due to his temper, mopes around and complains. How is that supposed to be a good female role model! Please save your money and a few good hours of your life and read something a little more interesting, challenging and fulfilling than this pulpy fluff."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"Reading \\"Gap Creek\\" by Robert Morgan, I was reminded of the folk song used in my title, for indeed, that is exactly what the characters suffer through. From the description of Julie Richards on the book cover, we know that she is a hard worker, and we know that her life isn't going to be easy. Set at the end of the nineteenth century, \\"Gap Creek\\" focuses on the marriage of Julie and Hank Richards, as they experience the downs more than the ups of starting a life on their own.Julie and Hank's marriage is a loving one. They set out to live at Gap Creek, but a series of events leads them into poverty and despair. Their landlord is burned and killed in a fire at the house; they are subjected to several con-artists who pretend to want to help them; Hank loses his job and Julie finds herself pregnant; and they have to endure a flood that nearly sweeps them and their house away. Yet through it all, Julie, and then Hank, are able to find solace in their faith and in one another. They endure their hard times to start over once again.Robert Morgan's writing is rich with detail. His descriptions of farm life are vivid, at times too well and stomach-turningly descriptive. The reader is instantly drawn to Julie, a well-rounded believeable character that many women could identify with. The other characters are less vivid, but exist nonetheless with clarity and ease. \\"Gap Creek\\" is an enjoyable read, filled with the hope to get through the lows that life throws our way."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"This is by far one of the most memorable books I have ever read. It left such an impression on me that I made everyone in my book club read it as well.

It's full of hardship, honor and most of all hope!"},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"If you're into books where nearly nothing good happens, this is the book for you. If you enjoyed Angela's Ashes, this is another book that will splendidly bring you down and depress you. Nothing happy or good happens to poor Julie, the main character in the book. The story is well-written in a simple, concise manner. While the writing is &quot;neat,&quot; the story is simply a downer. If you're looking for something to pick you up, don't pick this one up."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"GAP CREEK is a tough book. Everyday reality for the people in the story is relentless, an unremitting cycle of life and death. 1899 Appalchia doesn't allow much planning other than how to get through the coming winter.When Julie leaves her birth family to marry Hank, the newlyweds move into a cabin in Gap Creek, where Julie tends to the needs of the cabin's owner, while her husband goes to work in a nearby town. Early on, Julie understands that she'll have to bend herself around Hank's moods and emotional vacancies in order to keep the peace. A strong young woman, only seventeen at the time of her marriage, Julie has long been accustomed to hard work, one of her primary virtues. She finds comfort in her almost constant efforts to scrub, clean and endure.The author provides vivid images of the daily living conditions of these people, mired in poverty, always at the mercy of an indifferent and cruel natural environment. Barter for goods and services is the primary tool of aquisition, with few, if any, comforts available. They chop their own wood, butcher their hogs, plant their fields and hope for the best.It is obvious, from the beginning of the marriage, that Julie, now pregnant, is a stronger character than her husband, who barely has the resources and self control to rise above their frequently unendurable circumstances.While Julie's personality may be likened to that of Gertie Nevels in THE DOLLMAKER, Julie doesn't possess the hopeful spirit of Harriette Arnow's memorable Gertie. Julie plods through one tragedy after another, settling for little joy in her young life.There is no mistaking the accurate portrayal of these hard-scrabble lives, spoken in the simple language of their daily struggles. In comparison to 1954's THE DOLLMAKER, long a treasured and important novel, it is perhaps unfair to measure GAP CREEK against Arnow's powerful book. Still, I keep asking myself whether GAP CREEK is a stingy or a generous human story by any standard."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"Gap creek is an exausting tale of a North Carolina woman faced with death, death, and more death. Her hard ships seem to keep rolling with the death of her brother, father, and child. She faces flood, poverty, and hunger. This is not a story of triumph but rather a story of defeat. It does not successfully portray the strength of the main character but rather her subordinate behavior to a dominating husband, all the deaths, and hunger. She gives in. Then leaves. What a great motto. If the going gets rough; leave. Overall I found the story to be engaging but disapointing. I had high hopes for redemption but was terribly let down."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"Gap Creek is a spare, hard hitting novel about a young woman who endures much hardship and moves on in her life despite the horrors of her everyday existence. I was moved to tears many times and anger, and happiness, too. I felt I really knew Julie and wanted so much for things to turn out good for her. Mr. Morgan is a wonderfully descriptive author, I have to assume that he has actually done much of the work that he illustrates in this book, because the sheer drudgery and soul stealing resentment comes out so clearly through his words. I thought many times that if it were me who had to face what Julie did, I would have just sat on the ground and given up."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"Robert Morgan explores the hardships of life over a century ago through the eyes of Julie Harmon. Julie is a tenacious young woman whose wisdom and perseverance is beyond her years. She shows tremendous spirit, strength and will throughout this chronology of her life.

Morgan has written the scenes in beautiful language which will bring the Appalachia to life as you are reading."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"Gap CreekThis story was superb. The main character Julie was a true feminist. She never quit or gave up on anything,whether it was \\"fair\\" or not, hard or easy. She rarely worried about the opinions of others. She did what needed to be done. Instead of running back home to momma or just running off to look for an easier life, she kept her commitments. She actually understood what commitment meant and was willing to give whatever it took, no limits. She was a truly grounded woman and always approached situations with her faith, her heart and a big dose of reality. She spent little time worrying on things that she couldn't change. She had seen life and death and knew that life continued on no matter what happened, and there was no sense in just giving up and quitting. Julie was a person who lived in the present moment and did the very best she could each day. She never had her head in the clouds dreaming, but she enjoyed and experienced life to it's absolute totality. She was a truly inspiring, strong, Southern woman, and I loved her story."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"Robert Morgan creates an unlikely heroine.

This is not because I don't like Oprah, but because her book selections are usually very dark and depressing. Though I enjoy such books, I try to find them on my own. That way, if they stink, I only have myself to blame! Well, I stumbled onto Gap Creek on audio while at the library and didn't know that it was one of Oprah's choices. Once I started to listen to it, I was completely entranced and got the paperback so that I could read it even when I wasn't in the car. Now, I can see why Oprah chose it and have to give her kudos for finding such a superb read!Gap Creek takes places in the Appalachian Mountains of North Carolina where Julie Harmon lives with her mother, brother, father, and three sisters. The book opens with the death of Julie's brother which is then followed by the death of her beloved father. Julie was always a hard worker around the house and was assigned the chores that were usually given to men. One day while she is working outside, a handsome man drives by in the his carriage and the two begin courting. Hank Richards and Julie Harmond quickly fall in love and though Julie is only 17, they become married and move to Gap Creek where they will tend to the cantankerous Mr. Pendergast. Though their love for each other is strong, their responsibilities weigh heavy on them and their relationship. When Julie becomes pregnant, it seems like a blessing but as her pregnancy continues events occur that jeopardize their happiness and safety.When I discussed this book with someone else who had read it, we both commented on the fact that the novel is character driven and though there are plot points, none of them matter as much as the development of the characters and their relationship. In many ways, it reminded me a great deal of Carolyn Chute's The Bean of Egypt Maine which is an ultimate favorite of mine. Though the books are set in different time periods and in different parts of Appalachia, they have a great deal in common. Both are relationship based and describe not only those between two people but also between families and (possibly most importantly) between people and the land. The story is hard to read but that is only because the people in it are hard and their lives are difficult. There are no true heroes or heroines and the novel doesn't leave you with a warm fuzzy feeling, but I think those are the strengths of the book and not weaknesses. I would certainly recommend it to anyone who is sick of happy endings, cliched characters, and hackneyed plots and wants something more real. Bravo, Oprah, Bravo."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"The writer, Robert Morgan, was able to describe things in such a way that I knew exactly how things were done.

Julie was a hard working, seemingly intelligent woman. But she kept making mistakes which caused some disasterous outcomes. And her husband and mother in law were such losers, it was hard to take.

The author need to share the emotions of these two characters in order to grip my attention and make me think about the book long after putting it down. Oprah has made some wrong choices in books, but Gap Creek can not even compare to the emotions expressed in A Map of the World. I was expecting a similar book to Map of the World, feeling every emotion of the character, instead I was able to vision the scenery and work more than anything. I was very disappointed in this book.

The author heaps so many bad things on the main character you start to guess exactly what is going to happen before it does. Despite all this calamity, however, the heoroine never seems to change or grow. The other people in the book are pretty much stock characters: the inattentive, incompetent doctor, the town drunk, the pinch-mouthed mother-in-law, etc. In addition, this is a familiar tale of hard scrabble existence and survival in the face of all. It has been told elsewhere and much better. Check out: MY DROWNING."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"In general, I usually do not buy \\"Oprah\\" books since most of them are \\"downers\\" featuring disfunctional families or folks with so many problems you come away from the read in need of Prozac. I thought I would attempt one last Oprah book. Unfortunately, it was Gap Creek! Just how may bad things can happen to one character? This novel is permeated with detailed descriptions of difficult and unpleasant chores performed by Julie, the main character, interwoven with the unrelenting and excruciating anguish she experiences. Granted, the story begins in the last year of the nineteenth century when life was harder and survival required strong will and tenacity but this woman deserves nothing less than a Congressional Medal of Honor. The men she encounters (including her husband) are boorish and insensitive and the finite emotional nourishment she receives comes from other women. Perhaps the author meant the story to be inspirational, but I found it thoroughly depressing."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"Gap Creek was a heart-capturing book, filled with emotion and detail that make the book come alive, as though you are really there. Robert Morgan did a great job at creating a book that is so gripping, that I couldn't put it down. I really felt as though I was there on Gap Creek with Hank and Julie. I felt their pain and suffering right along with them. Gap Creek is one book I'll never forget. It was so sensational that it will stay in my mind for a long time."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"I read this book a few months ago over spring break and could not put it down. Perhaps that is because I had nothing else to do, but I think it has more to do with the truthful way in which the story is told. The author maintains Julie's voice throughout the novel, and successfully belies her [Julie's] extremely rural upbringing. The reader easily forms a mental picture of Julie, her husband Hank, their shack, the flood, etc.One reviewer described the book as &quot;depressing;&quot; I disagree. I found the book uplifting. Even in what nowadays would be considered substandard living conditions, Julie remains optimistic and dedicated. She knows how to perservere, and that is admirable. I greatly enjoyed this book, and recommend it to anyone who likes whole characters, writing, and setting.Also - the pig slaughter scene that is constantly mentioned is not that gruesome."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"GAP CREEK is a pretty disappointing novel.

A young girl endures and survives an upbringing in the rural mountains of Appalachia. Withstanding merciless grief over too-soon deaths in the family of mostly females, her fate is to be forced into a life of hard physical labor to support and sustain the family of her mother and four sisters. Julie successfully persists with this way of life until meeting and marrying. The story unfolds to reveal a young couple, married with too little money and too many woes. One particularly gloomy afternoon in their days old marriage, Hank strikes Julie. Julie is devastated, although a strong woman, she could not and will not stay with an abusive husband, but after a revealing visit from her mother-in-law, soon realizes what may have caused Hank's error. The young couple survive countless horrific tragedies driven by poverty and misfortune during their new life in this strange place called 'Gap Creek'.This is a story of a young unfortunate couple who may have lost each other along the path of a hard life, but have remarkably, through the power of love, forgiveness, hard work, and perseverance, find their way back to each other with a renewed sense of respect, commitment and triumph. There is no doubt that they are survivors and that they will continue to survive - together."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"When first beginning to read this book I didnt think that I would get interested in it. I thought it would be one of those books that I dont get hooked in and stop reading. I was very wrong. By the end of the very first chapter I had a hard time putting the book down. Morgan grips the heart from the very beginning of the book. The book was so descriptive that I found myself actually able to see what he was talking about, and feel the same feelings as the characters. He invokes many different emotions throughout. Although there are many deaths in the book that just make you want to cry, there is a certain way in the book that always seems to end up making you feel like a stonger person. Julie is a very strong person, and shows this strength early on in the book by taking on so many tasks. She even feels as though she needs to take care of her father, and is his right hand man, usually doing more work than he did. It takes place in the Appalacians and depicts a married couple living off the land. A part of the book that really struck me was when Julie was discussing men with her sister at the beginning, when she said, &quot;I'm burning up. Sweat was running down my face, back and around my temples, though it was below freezing in the woods. I hope no man ever sees us working like this, because he would never think of us as ladies.&quot; Its amazing how Morgan knows and describes exactly how a young lady can think and feel. Its usually hard for an author to capture the personality of someone so unlike themselves. I really enjoyed reading this book, although sometimes it made me cry. The overall feeling was that you can overcome any hardship, just as Julie and Hank found out. I would recommend this book to anyone, even if your not married it still seems to apply somehow. Its just a simple story with a very good point that makes you feel like you can do anything if you try hard enough."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"I reluctantly picked up this novel and by the time I finished it, I didn't want the story to end. I have grown up listening to stories from my Grandmother &amp; Great-Grandmother of our ancestors - &quot;hill people&quot;, from the Ozarks. I couldn't beleive it when the author touched on so many items that I had heard before, from hog butchering, rendering lard...even stringing green beans and gathering greens from the hillsides.The simple prose is almost musical. The way that Julie in her simple way deals with life, love, and loss is inspiring and serves as a lesson to people of my generation with our analytical therapy sessions and our endless pursuit of dealing with our &quot;stress&quot;.I have always wondered how my grandparents and ancestors dealt with seemingly endless tragedies and in spite of it all took so much joy from life.This story is a stark reminder to laugh, live and love."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"This novel brought back so many memories that it is really hard for me to forget even after reading it several weeks ago.

Julie was fascinating like most people who were self dependant in those days were. All in all, yes I would recommend this book for others.

It covered such a brief period, but oh! the hardships!

Robert Morgan has written a book of exceptional quality and truth about an exceptional woman in a time and place far removed from most peoples' lives. As he introduces her character and strength the reader at first feels pity, then amazement, but finally and most importantly, admiration as this woman deals with death, destruction and the loss of all earthly goods. But she still seems to come away stronger; in body and spirit. I read this book in one afternoon-found it impossible to put down.

For the most part the story kept me turning pages. Although, there were a few lengthy and tiresome descriptions of various farm chores and animal slaughtering, they reinforced the reality of our heroine's world. I also found the speech patterns to be slightly annoying, but easily tolerable when taken into consideration the time and location in which the story takes place. Julie was a wonderful heroine who teaches her reader about contentment, thankfulness, patience, and perserverance. Overall it was a delightful read that I would recommend to anyone."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"Excellent writing with powerful messages delivered in simple language. It's easy to lose sight of the difficulties of day to day rural living before modern technology and made our lives easier and allowed us to work \\"smarter not harder\\". Gap Greek helps us remember that the glory in hard work is not what we get for it, but what we become by it. The novel also demonstrates the importance of community, family support, and role both play in sustaining life. A good and easy read well worth the time spent."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"A wonderful read that is very gripping and will keep you entertained as well as tug at different emotions. Great character development that offers incredible insight into both the male and female point of view.

The setting, the story and the insightfulness of the characters make Gap Creek a truly special book."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"This fine novel written by Robert Morgan displays the hardships of living in the Appalachian high country during the end of the 20th century. The powerful beginning was a tearjerker but made the reader realize the family's struggle to survive. It is easy for some to take this life for granted but when reading this novel, it makes the reader count his blessings.This story begins with the death of Julie's little brother Masenier. Julie soon becomes the &quot;man of the house&quot; when her father becomes ill in the sense that she does all of the physical work in the forest. This is where Julie of 17 meets who soon is to become her husband Hank. Soon after their marriage, they find a house in the valley of Gap Creek. From here the first year of hank and Julie's marriage is played out.Julie prevails over the natural disasters, tragedies, physical boundaries, and culture differences during the strenuous first year of her marriage. Along with hank losing his job and Mr. Pentegast's, their landlord, death, Julie faces domestic abuse, a fire, and a flood. During all this time, Julie becomes pregnant with her first child. Although this is all physical hardship, Julie manages to find a mental escape once and a while to free her mind to find the strength to withstand this marriage.This novel is the work of a genius. He portrays the life of an average family beautifully in every aspect of the book. There is never a predictable moment as the author writes of the serious life and trials a young girl goes through, to some extent, even today. Julie is a true heroine and fights the elements to withstand the life of a young wife in the Appalachian highlands and the hardships of survival mentally and physically."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"This was a most interesting and captivating book to me. My grandmother emigrated here from Lithuania when she was about the same age as the narrator of this book, and she too, encountered many, many hardships in her life. Many of these hardships occured in Lithuania before she left - her mother died when she was 16 and she had to raise her youner brother and sister. She farmed and slaughtered animals for the family's sustenance, she endured the abuse of an alcoholic husband and raised 4 wonderful successful children. I loved this book because it made me feel close to Grandma and helped me to see and feel a little bit about her life, she is a true hero to me! I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"I have read all of the &quot;Oprah books&quot; and am usually quite impressed with her selections. But this one, while enjoyable, isn't really anything special at all. The characters are not developed very well and the story isn't terribly creative.It sort of reminded me of an abridged version of the &quot;Little House&quot; novels, except that the characters in those books were incredibly three-dimensional and Laura, while also a hard worker who struggled through tough situations and survived, was twenty times more interesting and inspiring than Gap Creek's heroine, Julie. Julie is a dud. Yeah, she works hard, but most women in those days did. Take that away and there really wasn't anything about her that made her stand out to me. Instead of being inspiring or admirable, she seemed kind of average. Not that I require that characters in a novel be incredible people, but Morgan was obviously trying to make me THINK she was incredible and it just wasn't convincing.The writing is wonderful -- you can tell the author is a poet. But the characters and storyline are flat. It's definitely worth your time, but it's not up to par with some of Oprah's other selections."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"Just like so many readers, I went for one of Oprah's Picks! I didn't have to read this book to know that women are hard workers, have backbones, and can continue to carry the weight of the world on one's shoulders, even in the darkest of moments! If you like repetitive descriptions of &quot;'taters, grits, and cornbread,&quot; and undeveloped characters throughout the book, then you might enjoy this read. I kept reading just because I thought that eventually something might happen. Thank God, at least Mr. Morgan came through with Mr. Pendergast's Hidden money ! I don't think this will be one for the big movie screen!"},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"Mr. Morgan has written an excellent work.

I have read other selections from Oprah's Book Club and loved them. This was a dissappointment. The book jacket summed up Julie as being a strong, heroic women but I found her sad. I understand that women of her time didn't have a lot of choices or a lot of freedoms, but putting up with a miserable life you have chosen does not make a person strong or heroic. I kept on reading, waiting for something to happen. It never did. This story could probably be told by a thousands of others whose grandmothers actually lived it, and lived it better than Julie. I suggest you go ask one of them."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"For reading a detailed account of life in Gap Creek, I was expecting more of an emotional attachment from the protagonist than what Robert Morgan gave the lead character."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"A self-described &quot;story of a marriage,&quot; this novel follows a young couple through the first year of their life together, living in a falling-down house on the edge of Gap Creek in Appalachia (arond the end of the 1800's, I'd say). Just about every bad thing that can happen, does. Which is fine with me. But the characters are poorly drawn and the storyline seemed kind of pointless to me. Now, that doesn't make a lot of sense, I know. It's just a novel that is supposed to be a year pulled out of these people's lifetime. There doesn't HAVE to be a point. Yet other novels that do the same thing haven't left me feeling like I missed something. I enjoyed this book, but it isn't anything special. If you want to read a book about the hardships, triumphs, and strengths of people living under harsh conditions, read the &quot;Little House on the Prarie&quot; books again. This was a lot like them, except it lacked everything that made those books great. Like depth. I'm not sure why Oprah selected this one -- there ain't much to talk about."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"This book would be good for young people to read who have never thought about hard life once was for a man or woman or child. It probably accurately describes where items were stored and how food was kept during that period. Privies, which most young people have never experienced, are covered. Cooking, the danger of fires, hog-killing are discussed and beneficial. Some parts of the book, however, are useless, such as the implied sexual attraction between Hank and Carolyn. The relationship, if there was one, was never completed in the story and I read through to the end thinking something else had to happen. In summary, the book was somewhat interesting but didn't fully complete the story insofar as I was concerned."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"This novel is a heartbreaker.

It is a gritty, realistic, gross, funny, touching, and loving look at the relationship between a young couple set against a harsh timeperiod. This should be a pre-marital must read for all young women who think that marriage should be all wine and roses! Might even cut down on the divorce rate!! :-) If Julie can stay with her husband and keep her head on with all she had to endure surely we can put up with dirty socks, hair in the sink, and too much time at the office!!

It's a pleasure reading, to see how love and willpower endure in a marriage."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"If all the trials faced by turn-of-the-century Julie Richards were laid end to end . . . well, her life would never be over. Another author might have made Julie's story read as a 'one step forward, five steps backward' pitiful saga, but Morgan gives Julie humility, depth and a gentle but fierce strength that guides her through virtually insurmountable crises. He does this in a way that makes her not superior but clearly one whose forebearance is greater than the average folk. This is a raw, heart-rendng and heartbreaking story of survival and perseverence. It is also a compelling read."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"An unusual woman lives in Gap Creek, who works as hard as a man and who marries as a teenager. Struggles with the land and with marriage lie at the heart of Robert Morgan's fast-paced novel Gap Creek, which centers around a strong country woman's determination and survival skills."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"I read &quot;Gap Creek&quot; over a month ago (...) This bookwas great! Julie learns a lot about being a wife really fast.She had to put up with WAY too much from her young husband. The pig slaugtering was a bit too graphic, but hey, that's life. Read this book and enjoy!"},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"Growing up poor and on a farm was a similar experience for me as a child. Maybe that is why this story struck at my heart. Julie and her family had no choices, they had to make do with what they had. With no money, they had almost no control over the changes in their lives. It was terrifying for me to read the truths of how harsh life really was for my parents and grandparents. I know in my heart, I would not have survived what Julie has been through so far in her young life. But the story ended with me just wanting to probe further into their lives, to find out if Julie's second baby lives and if Hank has matured into a good husband. I found myself surprised to realize the book only covered about a one year span in Julie's life. I want more!"},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"For those of us who live in the Appalachian Mountains and can remember our grandmother's stories of life there before WWII- this book really hits home. I very much enjoyed the book and did not want it to end. It is about poverty, survival, greed, love, the weaknesses and strengths of the mountain people. I read the entire book in a day and a half. The only thing I was disappointed about is that it ended too soon with many questions about the characters left unanswered. A sequel would be great!"},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"This book was simplistic in its writing (plot), but it was a book that kept my interest. The author's details and story telling were delightful and kept me reading on. The characters are raw and uncultured, ringing true to the lives people lived in the 1800's. This book was a pleasant three day mind break reminiscient of the writing styles of Christina Schwarz (Drowning Ruth) and Susan Fromberg Schaffer (The Madness of a Seduced Woman)."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"I have read books that deal with human suffering and hardship--Les Miserables, or lately, The Heartsong of Charging Elk--and they inspire me. This one doesn't. In fact, it is tedious in its descriptions of one tragedy after another. What bothered me most is the heroine's inability to do more than work. Yes, hard work is commendable, but so is change, and her character though stoic, is static. She seems to be destined to a life on the level with some animals because her only outlet is to work and then work harder. I think good fiction should give us a glimpse of a better way to live and to respond to the suffering that is life. Julie has one response and never varies from it. Gap Creek has one note to play and pounds it from the first page to the last."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"The ability of this author to capture a reader's interest with a fluent beauty of words is impeccable, however I was disapointed with the thin plot of the story.Perhaps I was simply frusterated that the end of the book did not resolve issues that I noticed throughout. To some, these may not even have been issues, therefore they may not feel as if they were left dangling without answers to obvious questions."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"Robert Morgan's use of dialect is especially well done. He doesn't hit you over the head with pronunciation in the way that Lee Smith does, for example. He gives us a clear picture by simply showing verb misuse.I did not find this book depressing, just gritty.An earlier reviewer thought Julie was not a credible character, too mature for her years. She was reared in an earlier era where girls married earlier and accepted responsibility far beyond what we would expect a 17-year-old to assume today. I found her to be entirely credible and her ability to deal with the many, but believable hardships that came her way was what kept the book from being depressing."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"A beautifully written story about a girl just starting out in her own life after getting married.

Although spouse abuse might have been acceptable in those days, Morgan didn't make it acceptable in my mind. I just plain didn't like or care about Hank. Eventually I found Julie tiresome because she just seemed to take his slaps and name calling in stride, going to on to scrub out one Aegean stable after another."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"I bought the audio tape of this 'book' and I guess I'm glad I did, because if the book was anything like the tape - it was boring as hell!

I just tore up my membership card."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"There are some good things to say about this book. The mountains of South Carolina and North Carolina are wrought beautifully; Robert Morgan's status as the poet laureate of North Carolina is unquestioned. He acptures well the stark beauty of the landscape, as well as the pain of living in poverty in the remote reaches of the mountains. The simplicity of his language sometimes gets in the way, though. His use of &quot;I said&quot; and &quot;Hank said&quot; throughout the story, without variety, becomes almost unbearable. Even more troubling is the glaring lack of character development. Julie Harmon's character is meant to represent a strong southern woman, but she gives in to other people's wishes too often and is too often silent to be credible. Her husband, Hank, is barely crafted at all. He comes across as insensitive, unforgiving, brooding, and humorless, but because there are a few instances which contradict this general impression, it's difficult to tell if that is what Morgan intended. The characters are so lacking in substance, the reader starves."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"Not since Angela's Ashes have I read a book with characters so strong and so courageous in the face of poverty and conditions that seem insurmountable.

What a powerful story!"},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"I love Morgan's words but Julie's life was just too difficult and finally seemed not quite believable to me. I kept expecting some little ray of light to come into this story but it seemed every time life began to get a little better, another tragedy struck. In The Dollmaker there is similar hardship but somehow Arnow's characters are more fully developed and you feel that their strength will enable them to push on through it. I love Morgan's use of language but this was not a very satisfying book."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"This was a moving story, which vividly potrayed a woman's daily struggles.

I loved this book and when it was over I wanted to know more of these 2 young people. The description was so clear I could see the house and all of the surrounding farm. I could feel all of Julie's emotions. I also enjoyed all the descriptions of everyday life for these people. It was hard but they had a strong faith in God and that helped them too. It was a joy to see a man in a book get down on his knees and pray for strength and guidence from the Lord. I do hope there is a sequel to this book. There is so much more I want to know about Hank and Julie."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"Read this a while back. The book is about a young couple whose lives are filled with poverty, loss and a series of misfortunes. You feel for Julie and the hardwork she does every day and grow to root for her even when she does some foolish things (won't say what). It also shows that love can endure the most difficult periods in one's life. Overall, it was a well-told story, well written."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"The main character is a resilient woman who I will remember for a long time.

A co-worker knew that my family was originally from south-western VA and knew I was looking for a good book! Wow did she get it right! It's a story of Love, Loss, Family, and hardship, as well as a story of surviving eventhough the world around you would just as soon see you fall flat and not make it.(not to mention it will really make you want a good jelly biscuit! I have read almost all of Robert Morgan's books but this is definately my favorite."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"I came across this book in the library while looking for another book by a different author. I picked it up and gave it a glance and it passed my test to determine whether it would be a good story or not. The first paragraph, even the very first sentence drew me in hook, line and sincher. The story is simply written but that's not to say it's boring or not well done. It's engrossing from start to finish and I found myself enraged on Julie's and Hank's part each time they were taken in by swindlers. They go through such devistation you're hoping for some mercy on their part. I was very pleased to also see that Godly beliefs were a large factor in this story. This is not an in-your-face kind of preachy story, but it is very inspirational and uplifting."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"This story grabbed me from the very start and it was hard to put it down.

I felt I was left hanging at the end as the story seemed to just stop. But I suppose since it was called Gap Creek and they left Gap Creek the story was over once they left.

I read this quite a few years ago and have re-read it several times (along with all Robert Morgan's books). I am an avid reader so I consider myself a decent judge. Gap Creek is simply wonderful in every way. Maybe you have to be from the south and be familiar with some of the dialect and way of life. Perhaps some of the reviewers simply didn't understand.

I will never forget these character."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"A quick read, cover to cover. This is a true life story, no fluff, just the intimate details of hardships endured, and how love can continue to lift you."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"I listened to this as an audio book, so my experience may be different than that of other readers.The woman who read this book, Kate Forbes, did a good job. She used voices for each of the characters (not as drastically different as some actors I've heard read books, but good enough) and did a good job with the Appalachian dialect as far as I could tell. I'd give her 4/5 stars.I checked this book out from the library because I heard to much hype about it a couple of years ago. I didn't really know anything about it, but I like period books and the brief description on the back sounded interesting to me.I really liked the story. There really wasn't much of a \\"plot\\" per se, as much as the story told of the couple's trials and tribulations throughout their first year of marriage. Hank and Julie went through quite a bit, after having only \\"dated\\" for less than a month. They moved down the mountain and moved in with an old man who Julie was expected to care for while Hank was at work and in exchange they didn't pay rent. After the old man dies from being burned Hank and Julie are left to fend for themselves and decide what to do about the house. The heirs to the \\"estate\\" are unable to be found, but Julie and Hank don't know what rights they have to the property or even who the heirs might be.At times, I found the dialogue a little annoying because it always seemed to go like this:\\"........,\\" Hank said.\\"........,\\" Julie said.\\"........,\\" Hank said.which got monotonous after a while, especially when listening to it. I expected more to happen with the dialogue in the same way the scenes throughout the story were described.Overall, I thought this was a great story. It's not happy by any means, but it sounds real and Hank and Julie make it through all kinds of hardships together. I like hearing Julie's inner monologue about her discussions with Hank and her reactions (or lack thereof) to what he does and says. I also liked hearing her interactions with her mother-in-law. She is a very strong woman character.This audio edition also had an interview with the author at the end. I found it very interesting to hear from the author how he loosely based this book on life of his grandparents. I also learned he has published another book based on his other set of grandparents that I look forward to reading some day.Great quote from the author during the interview:\\"There's often more truth in fiction than in non-fiction because the fiction writer is free to get to the heart of things...doesn't have to stick with the surface facts. It can create and arrange the facts to get to the moral truth to the emotional truth to the spiritual truth.\\" ~Robert Morgan"},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"I enjoyed reading it.

This is a story of strength that touched me and reminded me that inside us lies more strength than we might think. Julie reminded me of my grandmother who was also a great example of a strong women who knew that sometimes you do things when even you don't think they can be done. I loved the reminder of how true strength comes from God and that although this life is hard it is bearable through Him. Some reviewers thought this book was too negative, but I disagree. I think that this story was REAL. Julie's life was not always perfect or easy and I was grateful for that for no one's life is easy. When I finished this book I looked around at my apartment and healthy children and thought just how blessed I was and for that I am very thankful. Overall I highly recommend this book and I am glad I read it. I will remember the message of love and strength for a long time."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"This story of a young couple's hardscrabble married life in a valley on the NC-SC border could have fit neatly into a novella. While the direct, dramatic opening and follow-on introduction to the Harmons promises a colorful family saga, ad nauseum repetition and details of every mundane activity extended the story beyond interest. It seems like every scoop of grits and every pot of coffee was described. The best scenes are delivered upfront; so, by the middle of the book, nearly everything important has happened. While the major characters, Julie, the narrator and her husband, Hank, are rather flat, the writer's portrayal of them as immature and nave is realistic. The strongest moments features Ma Richards, the mother-in-law. When she leaves Gap Creek, she also leaves a huge space in the plotline. And, she doesn't return soon enough to save \`Gap Creek' from being a tortuously slow, morbid story with an unfulfilling ending."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"Robert Morgan is one of my all time favorites.

When I see it on the bestseller's list, I have to laugh. It wasn't even that good....as a matter of fact, it was boring. I never read a book where the characters were so un-developed. You never find out what any one individual's motivation is for doing anything. In marrying Hank, Julie leaves one life of drudgery for another. Now I understand that this was the way life was back then but the author has the nerve to have the words, &quot;The Story of a Marriage&quot; right under the title of the book. If this was the story of a marriage, then Julie should have stayed single."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"I love the story this book tells. I do not believe that there is any one outstanding part, but rather that each part fitted together makes the whole oustanding. I highly recommend this book.

Developing the story of Julie and Hank as newlyweds facing the world doesn't work as well, however. Hank is just too craven and pitiful in contrast to the redoubtable Julie. His redemption came too late and was unconvincing. I just couldn't buy it!"},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"Normally, I search out Oprah's book club books just because 9 out of 10 are a good read.

If you are a fan of any of Jodi Picoult's novels, Anita Shreve, or 9 out of 10 of those Oprah books - get this one."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"Even though Gap Creek was based in the time period of the 1800's with horse drawn wagons, no electricity, and living in the woods, I could relate with Julie. The details the author goes into anyone can feel Julie's pain. Gap Creek is one of my favorite novels because it shows the inner strength, physically and mentally, of a woman. Julie struggled throughout the entire novel, yet she still manages to survive. The situations she endures were tough and life altering, like when she gave birth to her daughter Delia alone on the kitchen floor or when her little brother dies in her arms while trying to get him home. Though gruesome and graphic at times, Gap Creek is an enjoyable, heartfelt novel."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"This was a quick read, and like most of Oprah's recommended books, there was oodles of hardship and pain.I admired the main character, Julie's work ethic and her ability to put up with so much, including her husbands moodiness and her mother in law's critizism. But the ending was what I enjoyed most because it closed on such a hopeful note. I can't speak for the historical accuracy of the story, but it did seem to ring true for me."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"I loved this book I could not put it down, Julie and Hank touched my heart they struggle through loss of family and home but they hold strong the ending left me wanting more .

But I loved the story so far."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"This novel made me realize how easy we have it in this modern age compared to the days that were described in Robert Morgan's _Gap Creek_. We may gripe and complain about how much we have to work to make ends meet. We may complain that we don't have time to do anything, and our schedules are packed with meetings and appointments, our cell phones and pagers competing for our attention. But, if you want to understand what it was like over one hundred years ago, this is a very good novel to read.The truth is we expect near perfection these present days in just about everything in our lives. We want the perfect spouse, perfect children, a perfect job, house and car. Our reality is that these can very well be expected, and if not, there are options available to us to manipulate our expectations. And, if our expectations are not met, there is always prozac to relieve the anxiety and depression we may feel.Robert Morgan absolutely nails what life had to be like back in the Appalachians in 1899 for a very young newly wed couple who start out their life with virtually nothing but the clothes on their back. A startling thought for anyone in the present day, this is a vivid interpretation of what it was like to make a life on a \\"wing and a prayer\\".The narration by Julie is lovely, simple and naive. She is still a teenager when she weds Hank. Born into a family where she was one of the eldest, she was counted on to work like a man. When she was in her early teens, her only little brother dies. The father falls ill, and it is up to Julie to do all the men's work. Resentful at times, she never revolts, but resignedly commits herself to these chores no one else can do.When she meets Hank, it is a quick courting. Within the span of weeks, the marriage is confirmed and together they move \\"off the mountain\\" to a farm house in the valley of Gap Creek where a cantankerous old man has agreed to let them live in exchange for cooking, cleaning, and basically doing all the chores on the farm. Hank works in the brick mill in town, until he loses his job. Around the same time, a devastating mishap kills the old man and Julie and Hank brace themselves for the heirs to come to claim the farm, leaving them homeless. A Christian couple, they selflessly commit themselves to keeping the farm up. They tend to the animals, plant the crops and keep up the home just as when the old man was alive.With no money coming in after Hank loses his job, their situation becomes tenuous at best. The description of their work day around the farm is overwhelming. For Julie, this is her calling, this is what confirms her very being; hard work and work that numbs the mind and body. As a young couple, they are primitive in their personal relations. In comparison to the expectations of intimacy in the present day, it is stunning to see the bare bones of a new marriage. While Julie minds her tongue, and gives Hank a wide berth, she does become a victim to his immature rages and temper when he is being challenged. Sometimes lonely and missing her family, she never betrays her husband and the commitment they made to the old man to keep the farm going.The harsh winter challenges this couple furthur. Without any funds they must make due with their wits and survival skills. This is a sensitive story of a marriage that survives more than hard work and a rough winter. It is a story of a couple that must face some of life's toughest lessons, but learn to love and make the ultimate commitment to each other."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"Set in Appalachia around the turn of the 20th century, \\"Gap Creek\\" is the story of Julie whose life is full of adversity and struggle, even after she marries Hank. Together they face each struggle with love and faith, and find their marriage strengthened. At least, that's the book Morgan apparently meant to write. Instead, \\"Gap Creek\\" is a monotonous, aggravating, tedious work that challenges the reader's tolerance. Julie and Hank have a relentlessly hard life, and their relationship is never fully developed. We're told they love each other, and yet it's never fully expressed for the readers. Morgan does have a gift with descriptions of the landscape and the daily grind of farm work, all of which are painstakingly portrayed in beautiful prose. Unfortunately this is drowned in a patchwork tale of unlikeable characters that just never seems to end. It's just one calamity after another, pummelling the readers into a daze. And Morgan overuses the word 'said' to an amazing degree, which makes one wonder whether his editor was paying any attention at all. As mentioned, there are moments of beauty in this book, but they are few and very far between."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"I got this book for Christmas and kept putting off reading it. I don't usually read this kind of book so I wasn't sure if I would like it or not. Surprisingly, I really enjoyed it from beginning to end, reading it in a day and a half. It starts a little slow but its very compelling and simple and the story flows from page one to the hopeful end. This is a difficult book at times due to the hardships she faced and its depressing to see how her life unfolded after marriage.I thought the author did a wonderful job with Julie's voice, it resonated very real to me. This is a woman from a very different time than those of us face now. Her hardwork is very real and descriptive in a way that makes you see how women had to be strong to survive such a turbulent life. Hank was often a very unlikeable character cruel to her at times yet eventually he ended up coming through for her. So these characters were real people to me who did change and grow with time and the pain they suffered gave them strength at the end. This marriage is a real marriage between two kids trying to face starvation, joblessness and being betrayed by others.If you like a simple but deep read, this is the one. Its a great story and a very honest one and shows you how how different life was a hundred years ago. A wonderful read."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"The book started off slow with the life of Julie living at home, and then moving into the difficult life of this young woman. Through Julie's eyes we see that she has such an optimistic outlook to what is going to happen and hopes for the best for everyone and everything. We see Julie going through hardships such as verbal abuse, work overload, the loss of a child, brother, and father, and poverty. Though these harsh things happened to Julie, she ends up finding herself and converting back to her religion. Hank, her husband, is a man who has gone through many troubles and does not know how to control his anger at points in his life and ends up hurting Julie as well as himself. Julie has troubles with Hank's mother, and at the beginning of the book is not able to express her feelings for Ma, but eventually almost has a mental breakdown and yells at her. I enjoyed this book although it was difficult to get started with, yet it ended with such a powerful message to all."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"This book really got me in touch with the hard times that people went through long ago.

This is the single most depressing book I have ever read, because it's essentially hopeless without the redemption of educating or instructing the reader in any meaningful way. Robert Morgan can certainly write; I only hope that he writes more interesting books in the future.

This one will remain on my shelves....I first started this book when I received it for my birthday some nine months ago. However, it didn't grab me at that time. Because of this, I hesitated picking it up and starting again. I was glad that I did. It reminded me of how young people used to get married, sometimes to people they hardly knew. The time is never stated in this novel, but I took it to be late 1800's. I do wish that the writer had listed that. This book focuses around the main character, Julie Richards, a 17 year old newly-wed. I usually do not care for men writing from a girl's point of view, but the author made this very believable. I did not like her husband at first, but as the character developed, I was able to see where the writer was headed. He showed the contrasts between the work ethics/habits of Julie and Hank, and how these had developed from their earlier lives under the instruction and control of their parents."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"Morgan's book was incredible. As I was reading the book, and actually saying the things that Julie said, I felt like I was there. I felt like I was her, living her life, hardships and all. The way that Morgan wrote was different than anything I'd ever read before which made it exciting and hard to put down. I found that when I was not reading the book, I was thinking about what might happen next or how Julie and/or Hank must be feeling. It was inspiring."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"This is a depressing tale of a young woman who marries a virtual stranger and is mildly surprised that he turns out to be cold and mean. She works like a dog, doesn't complain, and accepts her miserable life without any insight or motivation to change.I would like to have seen some growth in the character of Julie, but there was none. All I can say to the subtitle of &quot;A Story of a Marriage&quot; is that I hope that few people are locked into relationships like this one.The book is replete with illness, death, brutality, and unkindness. All of these I could accept if the main character had shown some human qualities, but she just plods on in saintlike acceptance of her lot.

Despite the beating Julie and Hank get from life, they emerge strong, more than two separate people, and ready to face a better life beyond Gap Creek.I've heard stories much like these from my grandparents and great-grandparents.

It talks about a rural girl moving to the Appalachians, away from her usual lifestyle back with her mum. I was quite disturbed that 3 people died in the first 5 chapters, later 1 or 2 more died including the character's child. That was appalling, and I think the author is trying to say, by using comparison between Julie and her husband, to survive one must help oneself and through supplication to God. But it was so obscure that it looks as if the whole story talks about how fate plays with their lives. They lost money, houses, everything, and then the story ended off with both of them walking back to I-forgot-where to start afresh. It is no typical book of Oprah, even though if you want to have a read on the bus or so, this is just about average for all -- easy to read, and simple."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"I am not a baby, nor a prude. I have read all kinds of books, some of which contain very disturbing and upsetting material. I read what the critics had to say about this book and was prepared for a bumpy ride. However, as I settled into a nice hot bath to read the first chapter, I had no idea what was coming. I was so shocked, repulsed, nauseated and disgusted by the description of the little boy's death that I literally threw the book across the room. I sat there, literally shaking. After a few minutes, I tried to pick it up and press on into chapter two, but I was too upset and couldn't read the words. I am sorry to say that I'll be taking the book back to the store ASAP. I am myself a writer, and do not believe in censorship, but I wish to goodness I had known how graphic and horrifying the imagery was going to be in this book. Maybe I'm oversensitive, maybe I haven't been deadened by watching horror films, but I won't be able to get that horrible image out of my mind for some time. Please, please, don't read this book unless you're able to deal with what I have described. I'm truly disappointed that I couldn't."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"All through this book I kept hoping something good would happen to poor Julie. Nothing ever did. I'm sorry but Hank was a lousy husband. 1. He moves her to a house far away from her family to live and take care of a grouchy old man. 2. She has to work like a dog to clean up this guy's filthy house and clothes. 3. He (Hank)smacks her in the face the first time she makes a mistake. 4. Hubby then looses his job because he can't control his temper at work and hits his boss. 5. Hank acts like a two year old child when there was a flood.(That whole scene in the hay loft was disturbing) 6. Please explain to me what kind of husband leaves his wife when she is about to deliver a baby with no one to help her!!! If you have not finished the book do not read beyond this point. I don't know about the rest of you but that gold coin Julie found right before they were about to leave was not hers to take. I have been thinking about it for days and have come to the conclusion that Hank and Julie lived on that land rent free for 7 months. The old man died early on and Julie only had to cook and clean for him for a short time. Also they used to land to plant their crops and ate and gave away that food. Now I do not think they owed the family any money for rent because that was not part of the agreement. I can't help it but I think they stole that gold coin. ..."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"I am 15 years old and in high school.

The constant &quot;I said/he said...&quot; drove me crazy. However, the worst thing about it was the unbelievably dreary story line and how unrealistically mature and introspective Julie was. Her character, for all she went through, was actually one-dimensional and predictable. All the book amounted to were detailed descriptions of country life and too many down home southern sayings. It was one trial after another with ridiculous \\"tough\\" insights by Julie. This was not realistic!

Example: \\"I don't know\\" Pappa said... \\"But I think so\\", I said. \\"You must go\\", Mamma said. \\"Why\\", I said... \\"because it's the best thing to do\\", Pappa said. In one paragraph she probably said about 8 \\"said's\\". I began to notice myself just concentrating on the \\"saids\\" and not the actual story of the book. Her inflictions, etc... UGG.

Julie is the narrator; sometimes her relatively uneducated, although perfectly fitting, first-person voice becomes a bit wearing.\\"Whatever man marries you will be the lucky one,\\" Papa once said to Julie, \\"For you're the best of my girls, the best one.\\" Papa had gotten gravely ill, and Julie hated that all the heavy work on the farm just naturally fell to her. Sister Lou helped some, but Rosie stayed in the kitchen, and young Carolyn was spoiled by everyone. The very young, only brother, Masenier, had recently died of a misunderstood and grossly disturbing condition.Because of hard life on the farm, Julie had not been around boys much. But the first time she saw Hank she thought he was the handsomest she had ever seen. She was too embarrassed to speak, she says, but uncharacteristically she boldly looked right back at him and couldn't take her eyes away.Mama invites Hank to church. And afterwards, to dinner. In a very funny scene Julie, all nervous and clumsy, splashes hot coffee on his knee, thinking she has \\"ruined everything.\\" Not so. Less than a month later, they marry, and leave Mama's mountain home in the North Carolina, and walk to a valley called Gap Creek, in South Carolina.They move to a farm there and a house owned by Mr. Pendergast, who still lives in the front bedroom. Rent is the meals Julie fixes and the wash she does for him. The young married couple's first night together is quite tender and humorous. As one might expect, the house situation becomes quite horrendous, even more so when Hank's mother, Ma Richards, comes for an extended visit.In relentless, elemental, unbelievable detail, Robert Morgan portrays the whole gamut of the human condition, in a year of strife, fire, death, deception, theft, raging flood, famine, and childbirth. Yet it is not without understanding, resilience, and unexpected reliance.What came to my mind on finishing the last page, were the words of the Preacher (Ecclesiastes 1.9):\\"The thing that hath been, it is that which shall be;and that which is done is that which shall be done:and there is no new thing under the sun.\\"Still there is hope and promise. A stirring exposition."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"This is by far one of the best books I've read in a long time. The writing is simple, but deep. The heroine is young and nieve, but she learns many wise lessons while at Gap Creek. This is a story that any woman can relate to!It made me want to get off the couch and get work done around the house!"},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"Stripped of all pretense by harsh elements in both nature and neighbors, Julie grows before our eyes into a heroine able to sustain and enrich her marriage and her faith through humility, simple grace and plain old hard work. More than a journal of one individual's coming of age, this time exposure of a young Appalachian couple in hard times accomplishes several important things. The reader is reminded of those elements that are truly essential: family, friends, and faith, and of the self-sacrifice and determination it takes to meet life's demands head on with honesty and willing labor. The narrator matures before our eyes, leaning on the support of her loving childhood family, now distant, and her almost prideful willingness to take on any necessary task, no matter how difficult. Facing flood, hunger, a threatening drunk, and decisions they have no preparation for, these newleweds discover what it means to love and why it is the most meaningful thing in this life."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"After the first reading, you might not get this book but I think with a long reflection afterwards, the quiet wisdom of it hits you. It's the stark and honest story of a young, hardworking girl ( perhaps the hardest working heroine I have ever come across) who is the rock of her family and who gets married to the first young, attractive man who shows some interest in her besides the interest she usually gets from her family as a dependable workhorse to whom all the unpleasant and most difficult chores fall to. The trouble is after her wedding, her husband falls in the same trap of expectations from her and the vicious cycle starts all over again. Julie works extremely physically and emotionally hard to keep her budding family together through a natural disaster, marital difficulty, financial hardship and childbirth. Throughout it all, Julie manages to stay strong, sane, optimistic and upbeat and teaches everyone along the way including the reader that selfless hard-work and a great attitude might not kill you but just might instead change the hearts of those around you and consequently the world."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"I enjoyed this book because it helped me to understand what life might be like for someone else.

Yet many people in our world still cope with these types of problems. We WANT to close our eyes to these realities, because they are uncomfortable. They do not entertain. But they do enlighten.Julie, the main character, does manage to cope with the difficulities that arise. Sometimes in surprising ways. How she copes with her husband's bad temper in a time when women were not liberated may give keys to coping with less than perfect family situations. And are there any perfect family situations?This book highlights the realities of a backward culture. Its lessons can be extended to any backward culture. But there is culture shock when faced with so many difficult and unhappy circumstances. Be prepared to look into your own reaction and what is causing it."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"Gap Creek was recommended to me at a book fair. I like books that can take you away (mentally), and you become a part of the story. Gap Creek does that, from the time you open the pages until you close them. It is great for country folk and modern folk alike. It was hard to get near the end of the story, because I hated to see the story end.

I found the setting and folkloric background wonderful and rich, enlightening me about the spirit of mountain people and their direct relationship with their habitat: sometimes lyrical, other times full of hardship. The vernacular Appalachian used throughout may alienate readers who are not used to it. But stay with it --eventually this book goes right to your heart.

While the strength that the main character, Julie, exhibits and her continuing on no matter what (she has no choice I guess) it left me asking other questions about the lives of the characters. Where does the money come from to spoil the baby sister? Where does the husband go when he wanders off all day? For someone so 'smart' and such a survivor, why does Julie always seem so gullible when dealing with outsiders? Why is everyone smarter than Julie? Why would she refuse to eat what good food they had when her unborn baby was in jeopardy? Why does she never ask her husband to help her, even when pregnant. I know she is portrayed as strong and a survivor but she seems a bit ignorant and has a bit of a martyr complex. In one instance she's looking for a way to make money to help them survive, why did her knowledge of herbs and folk cures never come to her mind?Very depressing book overall. Its going in the donation box, not one I'd give to a friend or to the book cupboard at the hospital."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"I enjoyed this story. great characters, nice writing. a novel about hard times in rural areas. I would read another one by the same author."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"Julie Harmon is an inspiring, likable character who keeps going even while enduring one tragedy after another. Morgan has said that he struggled to find her voice, but I think it's clear that he did find it because she is realistic and memorable. Morgan's writing is beautiful and at times poetic, which is not surprising given his background as a poet. The scene with Julie, her father, and brother in the woods at night is amazingly well done, especially Julie's realization that the natural world can be strikingly beautiful even as something awful is happening. The character of Hank is interesting and I got a pretty good sense of him, but I wish we had understood a bit more of his true personality and where he was coming from. The scenes with his mother give us some insight, but more might have been helpful. While the religious parts in the second half of the book didn't bother me at all, Julie's interest in religion seemed to come out of nowhere to some extent, even though it's maybe hinted at in the beginning of the book. There are a lot of lengthy descriptions of Julie's hard work throughout the book. Although at times they can start to get tedious and there's a \\"well-researched\\" feel to them, they do help paint the picture of just how hard working and tough she was. In any event, despite some minor issues, I loved Morgan's descriptions and imagery and I came away really impressed with this book."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"This spare little book is a minor masterpiece that takes you by the hand, back in time, to a simpler and more brutal place. There are so many priceless jewels captured in this novel. Morgan does an exquisite job of capturing the pain of childbirth in a way that surpasses any previous description. It is raw, gritty stuff. Life at the beginning of the 20th century was not for sissies. And he has done a quite remarkable job of capturing a tiny slice of this time. Beautiful prose."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"Wow, I've never really delved into the whole Oprah's Book Club thing, but this one had it blazoned on the cover, and it sounded like an interesting enough premise. I'm not sure I'd read one of her suggestions again after this. I was absolutely horrified at some parts.Julie has had a tough but loving upbringing. One of many girls ( a brother died young) she becomes accustomed to taking care of the family after her father falls ill. Then, one day, along comes handsome Hank who proposes to her within a week and whisks her away to Gap Creek. Here she is to be a housekeeper for the man they are staying with while Hank works in town. But a series of hardships befall them and test this young marriage out.Julie was an ok character. She wasn't really believable, but at least she was admirable. Hank on the other hand. I really despised Hank. Not only was he an idiot, but he was an abuser as well, physically, mentally, verbally. He was the whole \\"package\\" and not in a good way. And yet we were supposed to feel urges of sympathy for him through Julie's eyes. Although she presented with the feelings and emotions of an abused person so I guess that part was accurate, although hardly what I think the author was going for. Hank just ruined the whole book for me though, I kept hoping that Julie would leave his sorry self and that's when the story would get started. And since those two were the bulk of the characters in the book, there weren't even redeeming side characters to appreciate much.Not a lot actually happens as far as big events in this book. It just details the tough time that Julie and Hank have in their marriage with acts of nature, troublesome neighbors, and meddling inlaws. Not to mention the fights between the two because of Hank's insecurities. I can't deny that the book wasn't well written. It was well done in terms of use of language and writing style, the voice of the novel and accents were accurate, but the content was not ok. And it was a very very sad tale, with barely any light at the end of the tunnel.I just couldn't bring myself to like this book and will probably steer clear of Morgan if I come across another of his books. I just couldn't align myself to the way he presented his characters.Gap CreekCopyright 1999326 pagesReview by M.

Julie had unbelievable strength, courage and tolerance through all of the trials she faces in her new life. I didn't like Hank through much of the story, but I think it was only because he had a fair amount of growing up to do before he truly became a man and not just a boy trying desperately to act like one.

How old are you? Geez Richard...I thought you would know that it's different for women! If you don't know, you should find out, especially if you choose to write in their perspective! I agree with the one reviewer who complained about Robert Morgan's style. It seemed to get worse in about the middle of the story. I skipped sentences to keep interested.

Although the book is well written and the author paints a very vivid picture (sometimes too vivid), too many horrible things happen to make the underlying message of hope ring true. You are constantly left wondering what catastrophe can possibly happen next. Similarly, you keep waiting for things to turn around and they don't.

Julie should have knocked her husband up the side of his head with a spoon! He lied to her . He did nothing to help her and ran home to fetch his mother; who was the cause of all the trouble. No mother -in-law should force her pregnant daughter-in-law to butcher and lift large kettles of lard! This book is not worth the money paid to read it. The character development does NOT portray a true pioneer. It needs a rewrite to become a true depiction of mountain people. I suggest you read Follow the River / by Thom to know the hardships of the wilderness or the books by Allen Eckart instead. For a fun set of mountain people read anything by Jesse Stuart-now that's true mountain magic"},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"Just reading this book is enough to wear a person out. Hog killing does not rank high on my priority list, but if you want to know how to kill a hog, render lard, milk a cow, shuck corn and pluck the feathers from a turkey, this book is for you. Believe me, my head was spinning and my exhaustion level escalated to the roof by the time I reached the end of this book. Initially, the story is about a marriage - Julie and Hank's, but it might best be described as a farmer's handbook.The only interesting character in the book was the local drunk, Tommy Gosnell, who at least got my attention every time he hollered, \\"Piieendergaasss,\\" (Mr. Pendergast) the owner of the home in which Julie and Hank's reside. Unfortunately, unknown to Tommy, Mr Pendergast has met his untimely demise and Julie and Frank's future in the home is uncertain.Apart from page after page of the dynamics of farming and listing to Julie moan and groan about a woman's work never being done, the dialect and writing style just about drove me to holding the book over the end of my nifty Bic lighter and setting it aflame. The author seemed to be sending a message that read like a grade one reader,\\"Look at Julie, see Julie work, watch Julie milk a cow,\\" thereby, implying that the rest of the female gender does nothing all day long but sit around on their butts sipping tea and munching on dainty cucumber finger sandwiches. The book is okay to a point, but I cannot for the life of me understand how it made Oprah's list. If she has, in fact, read the book, she will certainly know how to slaughter a hog and scrub the grits from the kitchen floor."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"As soon as I began this novel, I was engaged in the plot and the characters. Morgan's writing is simple, yet lyrical, like the writing of Kent Haruf. However, as Julie's misfortunes continued to occur relentlessly, I began to lose interest because the story became tedious and plodding. Don't get me wrong; I don't expect happy endings or desire novels written in the manner of Nicholas Sparks. In fact, some of my favorite authors are Conrad and Dostoevsky, whose visions of life are dark and brooding. But the novel's change of events and more importantly, the change in Hank and in Julie, the remarkable protagonist who eventually comes to know herself, her husband and her life, come too late. They are almost afterthoughts, and so this reader is left with the belief that the novel is simply a series of unfortunate events. Morgan is a great storyteller; his simple, measured prose is remarkably real coming from the simple, uneducated, yet sympathetic Julie. However, my overall impression of this work is that it read like a Calvinist sermon: that salvation requires excruciatingly hard work, and at best, a very grim and bleak existence."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"Annotation-\\"Gap Creek\\" is a story based on love and marriage between two very compassionate human-beings. Gap Creek is a story of growing up, overcoming obstacles, and managing life with all hands. This story will open up your heart and take you into a world filled with realities of what married life can turn out to be.Author Bio- Robert Morgan was born and raised in Green River, a small community in the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina. He studied at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and in 1968 he earned an MFA from the University of North Carolina at Greensboro. In 1971 Morgan began teaching at Cornell University where, since 1992, he has been the Kappa Alpha professor of English. Morgan's childhood memories include that of growing up in a small and isolated valley in the North Carolina Mountains are a fertile and constant inspiration for his fiction, which deals with such powerful and formative experiences as attending Pentecostal services, farming, marriage, and fighting disease. Since 1969, Morgan has published four books of fiction, including The Hinterlands (1994) and The Truest Pleasure (1995) named a Publishers Weekly Best Book of the Year and a New York Times Notable. (bookbrowse.com)Evaluation- I found the story of \\"Gap Creek\\" to be somewhat gory, but at the same time there was meaning and suspense to the story that kept the pages turning. This story is a very realistic way of life early in the 1900's when life was very frightening, and a lot tougher than it is living in today's world. The two main characters Hank and Julie fell in love and agreed to marry. They moved to Gap Creek where Hank got a job at a mill. Julie's job was to take care of Mr. Pendergast's house that he rented out to the couple. Throughout the story many unfortunate misshapenness take place such as Mr. Pendergast dying, Hank losing his job, Julie becoming pregnant, Fires, floods, and many more devastating events that took place. Julie and Hank had to live off of food from their garden, and canned food that had been saved up from the winter. They had to wash and boil their clothes to keep clean and survived on Milking cows to drink from. Life was not easy, but Hank and Julie managed to survive.This is a story that will open up your eyes and make you look at your life a little deeper. \\"Gap Creek\\" teaches us the lessons of marriage that anybody can manage to run into throughout ones life. Marriage is not always just fun and games. Hank and Julie were two lovers who despite their many obstacles always had compassion for each other. All through the many up's and down's. They needed one another to survive and they did just that together."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"This was one of those page-turner books that I just could not put down.

I know because I grew up there. Just like, Julie Harmon, I've milked cows, sawed firewood, and ate cornbread for breakfast. I can also identify with Robert as a writer. My novel, Edge of Heaven, puublished: November, 1997 by Bright Mountain Press in Asheville, N.C., is set in the same place and time period. I think it is hard for a man to write about a woman's feellings and still harder to tell a story in first person. This method prohibits the author from letting the reader know how the other characters, who are important to the story, are feeling and thinking. Given these handicaps, Morgan did a great job.

The work of day to day living back then was mind-boggling! The characters go through many trials and tribulations - fire, flood, extreme poverty, deaths of loved through and clean up after a flood; childbirth.

The life Julie and Hank lived was common at the turn of the century in 1900. When my relatives were young, their families had a smoke house, lived off the food from the garden, canned food for the winter, washed and boiled their clothes, and many other ways of life this book brought alive to me. It gave me a true appreciation for my ancestors' struggle just to maintain daily existence. Gap Creek teaches us a lesson too......hard work, faith, and endurance can see us through any hardship, just as Julie and Hank learn in the end. The book was well written.....Morgan's descriptive style made me either hungry, or wanting a cup of coffee just by the way his writing brought the smells to life! I thought the book was a very accurate depiction of Appalachian life in the late 1800's. I am so glad I lived through this turn of the century instead of that one! Julie's strength is to be admired. All in all, a very enjoyable read"},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"This book was OK. Based on the recommendation of the book in &quot;what we're reading&quot; on this site, I had it on the pile of books &quot;to read sometime&quot; by my nightstand when Oprah chose it (and being a big Oprah fan, I immediately read it). One positive thing is that the heroine, Julie, is extremely likeable. However, there were plot elements that didn't make sense to me (if she is such a hard, tough, nononsense person, then how does she make the silly mistake that seems to trigger a chain of ruin in her and her husband's lives?) and the litany of one disaster after another was a little hard to take. Another plus was the detail in which farm work is described (very realistic if you've ever seen a hog butchered, by the way, or cleaned a turkey yourself). However, the only character that seemed to have any subtlety was the the heroine. Her husband, mother-in-law, and sisters are all flat characters that seem to have only one major character trait (negative) a piece. I didn't see what the point of the marital infidently scene was, since it doesn't contribute additional information to the characterization of the husband or the heroine and it doesn't seem to play any role in the plot (which is pretty one-toned, if you asked me). The very limited character development in this book &quot;didn't bring me anything but down,&quot; sadly: Julie is a hard worker when we meet her and that doesn't change, but every time she has a moment of happiness, it's crushed. Nonetheless, these experiences don't seem to have any effect on her.In short, the book is OK and I did read it all the way to the end, but I'm not sure it really rated the bestseller status that Oprah's selection is sure to give it. I'll have to read Oprah's website and find out why she selected it."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"Well-written, great details about lifestyles of the time period. Great imagery. However, it was your typical grim hard-knock-life depiction of life in Southern Appalachia. It's not a feel-good story, actually it's quite depressing. It gives us insight into the difficulties that we will never suffer, and fills one with gratitude and thankfulness that this is not MY life."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"The book is very well written, with authentic (yet non-distracting) language of the location and era. The descriptions of the environment and day to day tasks are vivid.Morgan does a good job creating &quot;real&quot; people, with with real frailties, real fears, &amp; real joys. The characters are relatively young at the beginning of the story, and it is satisfying to see them use their (mostly tragic) experiences to grow into mature, self-assured adults.Having grown-up in this area of North Carolina myself, I can say Morgan has quite a talent for capturing the essence of the place. The smallest details are there--the language, commonly heard first-names, typical religious services, daily tasks, the weather--everything that makes it what it is."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"This story of a young couple's hardships in the turn-of-the-century Appalachians gave me appreciation for our modern conveniences. I found myself yearning, however, for the honest hard work and satisfaction of living off the land. Morgan's style was crude at times--maybe intentionally--but I've read other novels that captured that same gritty character with a bit more passion. When Julie's newlywed sister comes to visit, for example, Morgan describes their laughter in every other paragraph. I got the point after the first two times. He could have plumbed the emotion and history with more feeling and depth...or maybe just more writing elbow-grease. But let's face it: this book works its way under your skin, demanding attention, or at least a reaction. Julie and Hank's relationship seems devoted, but more guarded than modern relationships. In the end, I enjoyed the coming together of the family, even through tragedy. The story had a message of hope, asking us to love others more than ourselves. Through its simple beauty and spartan writing, Gap Creek eventually made its way into my heart."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"First, congratulations Mr. Morgan, you've made it!

You will experience life of very poor folks living in the S.C. mountains and like Oprah says &quot;you'll be glad you live in this day and age&quot; after you read this. As in all of the Oprah picks, you have the opportunity to live in another world, another lifetime.

Gap Creek is subtitled The Story of a Marriage. I suppose it is that story, but I don't see why the story had to be told.The narrator is Julie, a hardworking teenaged mountain girl. The first chapter tells us how Julie watched her young brother die. It did get me hooked, but it ultimately had absolutely nothing to do with the story. Then she watches her father die. Then she chops wood, gets married, cooks grits, butchers a hog, cooks grits, catches the house on fire, cooks grits, gets duped out of money, cooks grits, gets lost in a flood, cooks grits, has a baby, and cooks some more grits. That's pretty much it.I enjoyed the book until I was about half way through. It really did keep me interested. But I eventually realized that nothing was really ever going to happen. And nothing did. Even the tragedies were anti-climactic. They simply happened, then Julie cleaned the house and cooked a meal. Every now and then the author would throw in an element that would make me catch my breath, but it would turn out to be absolutely nothing. So many storytelling opportunities were missed. The story of Julie and Hank falling in love is boiled down to: they meet, they have dinner, they kiss, he proposes. Yet, the author spends pages upon pages telling us the finer details of butchering a hog, dressing a turkey, chopping wood in the winter, and cleaning up after a flood.That's what has me puzzled. There's just not a story here. It reads like a diary, which reveals that life, for all its struggle, is really pretty darned dull. Given that this is a work of fiction, surely the author could have thrown in some conflict. But for every would-be conflict, the moment simply passes and is quickly forgotten. Nothing has any true consequence in the end. Gap Creek truly reminded me of Little House on the Prairie, but it was not as exciting.The story of a marriage? Perhaps. The story of the daily routine of the first year of marriage between two people who barely know one another. By the end they know one another perhaps a little better, but don't appear any closer because of it. And then it moves on, where Julie will undoubtedly chop some more wood, scrub another foor, and cook some more grits."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"Like all of her other Book List picks, Oprah has chosen a masterfully written book on the adversity faced by Julie Edwards, a 17 year old bride and mother to be living in the valley of Gap Creek, SC. The book describes the tough life faced by Julie and her husband Hank, as they face poverty (true poverty), floods, death and other trials of Appalachian living. Yes, there is repetition in the description of the meals, in her cleaning, and in her and Hanks daily lives, but that's to reinforce what Julie's reality is: There are no diversions, that is her life! Day after day of cooking, cleaning, working and just existing. You get exhausted and irritated just reading about it, because Julie is exhausted and irritated by living it!"},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"Julie Harmon will become one of the great heroines in literary history. The story takes place in 1899 to 1900 in the mountains of North Carolina. With a father with lung disease, Julie and her sisters must work the land for the family to survive. Julie is unlike any other young woman of the times - she has a desire to meet and marry a nice young man. After witnessing the agonizing death of her brother and suffering the hardships of being the &quot;man&quot; and essentially the leader of the family, Julie finally marries, leaves her family and moves with her husband down the mountain to Gap Creek. The young couple face numerous obstacles, challenges and hardships during their first year of marriage. This is her story. A great read and I heartily recommend it.

That alone would have made the book interesting, but there was more. I found that the heroine, Julie, was someone I genuinely liked and admired. She was a real person who made real mistakes, but she also had a core of integrity that directed a lot of her decisions. It was refreshing to have the main character be someone I'd want to sit down and have a cup of coffee with. Actually, it was my affection for the heroine that leads me to only assign this review four stars. While I enjoyed the author's beautiful prose, I wanted more of Julie's thoughts and feelings to be described, since I found that to be the real strength of the story. So, the portrayal of everday life in the mountains was realistically harsh, but the characters, especially Julie, are worth getting to know."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"I really loved this novel. I hurt for them and all their hardships but was so thrilled with the ending.

I found this story not to be particularly page-turning, but more of an easy-flowing journey. Gap Creek is truly a triumphant statement of the strength of women in an era when women were to be no more than mothers and housekeepers.Life still goes on in the Harmon household after the death of the youngest child, Masenier. For 17-year-old Julie, that means getting back to what she does best: chopping firewood and slaughtering hogs. This hard-working life seems to be all there is for Julie since she never has time to be a teenager. But that all changes one day when Hank Richards comes by to ask directions to a neighbor's house. Soon, Julie finds herself married to Hank and living far down the mountain in Gap Creek, South Carolina. Mountain life in her new home is much harder for Julie now that she's without her family. But Julie shows insurmountable strength and determination in every situation and struggle that comes her way.In Gap Creek, Robert Morgan has shown us another great literary character. Julie Harmon Richards embodies the true status of a mountain woman. Her perseverence is one quality that all of us can strive to achieve. This novel is well-written and heartfelt; however, it is explicit in some of its details (which can be good or bad depending on your outlook). Nonetheless, Robert Morgan deserves a big \\"Thank you\\" for creating such a memorable character and for writing such a believable and emotional story."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"After the great reviews, I was looking forward to reading this novel. I enjoyed &quot;Cloud Mountain&quot; and am particularly fond of southern writers and fiction. I have also found that good writers can write from either a male or female perspective. &quot;Gap Creek&quot; misses it on all fronts. It has a thin story-line, (the historical narrative approach suggests great depth and although it's reasonably long, I read it in one sitting) and poor character development. I was especially put-off by the fact that the main character (Julie) clearly spoke from the authors personal male perspective on marital intimacy (sex cures all) and marital abuse (it's acceptable in certain situations). Marital abuse is a reality, especially for this period, but the response of the character Julie in both these circumstances did more to perpetuate a male fantasy than to relate the impact of both those experiences on a teenage girl. To be fair, other aspects of her character development (though not of any others) were reasonable and consistent. &quot;Gap Creek&quot; will might make an okay movie on HBO or published as an excerpt in a mass-market magazine, but a great (or even good) novel it's not."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"A wonderful book, beautifully - and sometimes painfully - developed and delivered.

Julie and Hank must fend for themselves in every aspect of their lives. They face con artists, death, floods, fire and childbirth. Starvation and loneliness also enter into the picture.Julie has always known hardship and hard work, her work ethic is unbelievably strong. Her unending courage and determination throughout the book inspired me. She grows from a young girl into a young woman at a fast pace during the first year of her marriage to Hank. Her love for him never wavers and in the process her spirituality grows as well.The ending left me wanting more ~ did they ever find the happiness that they so deserved?

With her brother and Papa extremely ill, Julie is left with many responsibilities and accomplishes what needs to be done for the family. After both her brother and Papa pass away, Julie and her sisters begin to think about marriage and families of their own. Julie does not think for a moment that she would be one of the first to get married because she is not soft and delicate like her sisters, but much to her surprise, a charming and handsome man from church starts paying attention to her. He dazzles her with his allure and appeal. She looks forward to spending the rest of her life with him. Once married, Julie discovers that her expectations of being married with Hank are not entirely met. She realizes that living in the modern world is complex and she must find a way for love to keep the chaos in their lives far away. She finds herself being the rock through difficult times and often too many times, plays the role of both husband and wife. Julie does most of the work that needs to be done and never once complains. She is supportive, admiring, caring, and loyal to Hank, although she does not always agree with his behavior. She always puts others before herself, through good times and in bad. Near the end of the novel, the author changes the attitudes of Julie and Hank. Hank is no longer a bitter and confused individual, who feels sorry for himself because he can't get a job, but is sparked with hope that he can succeed. Julie becomes braver to speak up for what is right and is able to confront Ma Richards, her mother-in-law, whose negative mind-set is abusive to Hank. Both, Hank and Julie, become closer to God and accept the Lord to work in their lives. Their trust that everything will work out enhances as their trust in God heightens. The destitution involved with living at Gap Creek cradles Hank and Julie's relationship in a more secure and loving world. Julie's character would be best described as strong-willed, determined, sincere, loving, and compassionate. Hank's character would be portrayed first as scared, unstable, and tense, then transformed into sensitive, caring, genuine, and trustworthy. The theme of this novel is definitely screaming,\\" You will overcome your troubles!\\" This book encourages the idea that God is in control of our lives and He does provide for us at all times. We just might need to look extra hard sometimes. I enjoyed the style of this book, as well as the tone and setting. The style, in which this book was written, was very relaxed and the tone is truthful and sincere. The setting is in the beautiful scenery of Appalachia, during the Depression. The book had many strengths and extremely well written points that can relate to many people's daily lives and struggles. It is satisfying to read something that you can relate to and say to yourself, \\"Oh, I know what that feels like\\", or \\"I've been there too!\\" Another strength that the book includes is that it enforces the feeling of determination and perseverance. You develop a desire within yourself to work hard and succeed. I don't believe there to be any weaknesses in this novel, but full of only strengths right after the other, chapter after chapter. The style of writing was perfect in expressing how common the hard work was for Julie to carry out in that time period and setting. I also don't believe that there is anything that the author did that he shouldn't have done for the benefit of the novel. There is nothing that he didn't do that he should have. The novel is perfect in expressing the hardships of Hank and Julie on Gap Creek. It is a breath-taking book, full of adversities and Julie and Hank always at risk of losing it all."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"I enjoyed the way the author wrote and I enjoyed the story being told.

I always knew they endured many difficult times and grueling work. This book was able to really catch the details of such hardships. I certainly know I would not have the strength or determination to survive such a life.The main charactor Julie always had to work hard. Getting married did not mean that her duties would lighten up. In fact she had to work harder than ever and found strength which she never knew she possessed. What I appreciated the most is the description of Gap Creek. At one point it sounded like a beautiful place rich with scenery and wildlife. At another point it sounded like a miserable prison.What was interesting is how the main charactors Hank and Julie grew. Especially Julie who never had to do kitchen duties before getting married. By the end it all seems very natural. Hank who is essentially a mama's boy begins to think and speak for himself. The only weakness(very small weakness) that I feel worth mentioning is that I felt there was no follow through with Julie's family . Especially her spoiled sister Caroline. Otherwise this is an excellent read. Eventhough it is fiction, I feel that it truly captured the true hardships and defined perseverence. It should be a required read for all high schoolers.

But no matter what Julie remained strong even though Hanks depression. She was an amazing woman who was truly inspiring.

The human spirit of this book is touching, the characters real, a wonderful read."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"I thought the book should be appriciated for what it is.This is a book of simple people and I got exactly that.I don't agree that the characters were underdeveloped.I think that is what the author wanted and it was his intention to focus on the way of life instead of a deep complicated character.I thought Julie was a great charachter to express the lifestyle and times.It was simple but very good. I felt taken away in Julies world and learned alot of interesting things about their times and living."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"I found this book to be a very good read. Mr. Morgan has a very keen insight into the mind and actions of a mountain woman. My Grandmother was from the North Carolina mountains and her account of mountain life was very similar to Mr. Morgan's account of Julie. Like most mountain folk, Mr. Morgan is a wonderful story teller. I did not want to like the husband in this story. His character was selfish and weak. However, after completing the book I had to concede that his character was very realistic. He came into the marriage as a spoiled child but after many trials and sorrows he grows up and becomes the husband that Julie needs. I would like to read a second part to this book and see what happens to Hank and Julie after leaving Gap Creek."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"&quot;Simple and hard&quot; was the way Julie descirbed her life to her father in an imaginary sequence towards the end of the book. This was surely true of the kind of life she led. This couple truly were tied to the earth and very close to the elements of nature and the calamities they can cause. For the sequel, I think the couple should move to Oklahoma and encounter a tornado and its consequences. Since they've dealt with fire and flood, it seems they need a tornado and somepestulance like grasshoppers attacking crops."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"I really cared about the main character, Julie.

It is sad and shows how hard life can be. It also shows, however, how we deal with what life gives us, good or bad. The characters are entirely believable and Robert Morgan's way with words is incredible. The imagery formed from his words creates a wonderful backdrop for the story. Although I was a little bit disappointed with the way the story ended, I think it is all part of showing how life doesn't always hand you happy endings."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"I was thinking this author must have once experienced severe abdominal pain; I felt Julie's suffering in agonizing detail, as I relished so many of his detailed descriptions.

I found Gap Creek to be a thin story and inconsistently written. I found references to the Millenium, lipstick and foil to be out of place in a story taking place in 1899. Facts the editor should have noticed. Also, the grammatically incorrect speech patterns use in their everyday life were never used in the many prayers in this story. Mr. Morgan would wax-on with very detailed descriptions of the colors Julie was seeing during semi-dream/sexual sequences but never described Julie physically to his readers. A description I found myself wanting throughout the entire book. I was 3/4 through the book before I had that feeling of wanting to know what was going to happen next, but nothing really did. A lost opportunity to write something really special. Written on the reading level of a sixth grader."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"Having lived in Appalachia/western North Carolina for 20+ years I have seen a lot of Julie's life back in these mountains and old-timers have told me stories of their meager beginnings.

I think I am exhausted from just reading how hard Julie worked! Maybe after I write this I will go scrub down the ceilings in my house, cut up some firewood, abandon the fancy washing machine for a tall kettle of hot water and lye soap, can some jellies and jams, crack the head of that hog I slaughtered this morning (love to fry up those hog brains for a dandy breakfast tomorrow morning for my man), gather some eggs,dig up some greens by the creek bank, and then sit up all night with a sick relative. Ok-- so I admit it I had my child at a hospital and did not deliver him myself...and yes I didn't even bite the umbilical cord in half with my teeth. WIMP! Can ANYONE really work as hard as Julie did? She might as well have been a workhorse and slept in the barn. A good book-- a bit repetitive at times-- lots of taters and grits were cooked up-- but a very heartwarming book on life and living as it use to be. Getting married was for life then (1900) and working hard was an accepted way of life for both men and women. I have to admit my overwhelming feeling as I got into this book was -- can she take any more? And the answer was always...yes. I am a wimp but this book is not. A good, easy read."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"Gap Creek is a completely exhausting, yet exhillariting novel. To see how hard Julie works day to day, yet sense the contentment in her life is enlighting. She has to bear more tragedy than you can imagine, yet she accepts her plight in life and makes the most of her situation. She never loses faith in her husband, Hank. In fact, in her time of greatest need, he finally seems to find his purpose in life in taking control of his household. This seems to bring Julie and Hank closer together,when he realizes he is needed and she realizes he can step up to the task. Her near-death exchange with her late father is a tender, thought provoking moment that reminds us all we can be &quot;worthy&quot; just by loving others more than ourselves."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"It is amazing to think about how people had to live back at the turn of the century. This book opens our minds to how easy our lives are comparitively. Things we take for granted, food, shelter, medical care, transportation, a paying job, were hard won back then. Julie's life made me realize how spoiled we have become. If everyone worked as hard as Julie, no one would go to bed hungry and everything would sparkle. I thought this book was well written, not a happy story, but , a story that needed telling. Read his other books, The Hinterlands and The Truest Pleasure. They are wonderful, too."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"This book is so basic, so simple and almost too predictable. Not challenging in the least bit.

I have to admit it has kept me up at night, more in anticipation of what could happen - only to be disappointed that not much does. Altough, Morgan is very descriptive, especially when it comes to every single meal Julie makes and step by step instructions on how to slaughter a hog, I found myself skipping paragraphs out of boredom. I am a little more than a third done so I may be unfair in my judgment.

One day, she meets a young man named Hank who comes to visit on the farm. Although she is only 16 years old, she falls in love with Hank the first time she meets him. Against her mother's wishes, they decide to get married. Right afterward, they pack up the few belongings they have and move to Gap Creek because Hank found work in that area.

This was a captivating book which I read in a weekend. The story takes place in the poverty of the Appalachian Mtns and follows the hard life of a young girl who leaves home when she marries at 17 and then follows the struggles that the newly married couple goes through. There are many heartbreaking points in the story and there were a few bits of melodrama, but overall the author does a great job of really making the reader feel that they are right there, next to Julie as she is living through these events. I understand that the author loosely based the book on the story of his grandparents first year of marriage, which makes the story much more meaningful. My husband also read this book, since I liked it so much, and he loved it! We have been recommending it to all our friends."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"I am dissapointed that Oprah included this book on her list and even more dissapointed that I wasted my time reading it! The entire novel is a progression of horribly unlucky events. Life is hard enough without bringing the trials and tribulations of this young woman's life into your own. In most novels where shadows are continually cast upon the lives of the characters a light appears at the end of the tunnel. In Gap Creek, I was pleading for the end of these poor people's lives as it appeared to be the only means for their escape from the hell on earth Mr. Morgan cast them in."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"I just finished this book up and was surprised at how good it was.This book is a total tragedy though. The story starts out with Julie talking about her brother's death and how he was in her arms when he died. After that her father is taken ill and almost off of the work on the family farm falls onto her shoulders. She works so hard and resents so much, that she ends up marring Hank when she is only 17.They move to Gap Creek where things only get harder. Hank looses his job, Julie is pregnant.The book is beautifully written and tragic, but also very heart warming as Julie and Hank learn to lean on each other and over come tragedy and heartbreak. It is a wonderful inspiration to how a marriage can grow and become stronger."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"I really thought that this was a great book. It was recommended to me by my friend's mom and it really was a great recommendation.

I live in West Virginia and was intrigued to purchase this book because it pertained to areas I am quite familar with. The book was somewhat boring in a few parts but overall I found it to be a true testament to the hardships people in Appalachia had to endure.

It was set in the early 1800's in the country. It showed the main character, Julie, overcoming many horrific trials. Julie is determined to be a good wife.

It is a tale of those who never had it easy, and likely never will, who walk the uphill of life taking each bump as it comes, clear eyed and without any expectation that life will be different than it is. It is a tale that reminds us that to be rural and poor does not mean that one lacks greatness of spirit and a vision for how life is to be lived.I liked the clean, straightforward quality of this lean but satisfying story of youth, love, loss and accomplishment. It felt real. The characters were well depicted and engaging. The author let them evolve and mature in ways that seemed credible given the time, place and opportunity afforded them. It made me wonder what the so-called American Dream really is all about.A quiet, insightful and engaging tale."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"The marriage that Robert Morgan depicted in this novel was timeless. Times were certainly different 100 years ago, but people haven't changed much and some of the things that Julie and Hank went through in their time living on Gap Creek reminded me of the first couple of years of my own marriage. This is a must read for anyone wanting to escape the hustle and bustle of the 21st century for a week. You'll never forget Gap Creek."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"I thought &quot;Gap Creek&quot; had a lot of good points, as well as a lot of bad ones. First, I have to compliment Morgan's style of writing. He truly has a gift for making words in a story flow. However, I thought parts of &quot;Gap Creek&quot; was more or less a typical story of early Appalachia. When Julie is a teenager, she makes Hank, who is only a teenager himself. They marry young and move from the only town both of them has ever known. There, they learn that life isn't always peachy and sometimes the people who work hard don't always finish first.As I said, the story is fairly typical, but the characters and writing style are not. Julie is a hard worker and very honest. I found myself hoping with each turn of the page things would work out. Hank is more mysterious to the reader, as he is to Julie, which only adds to his character. Even though some of this story is mundane, it still will keep you turning pages."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"Can't deny that this has a good story line, but can't understand how an editor could let a writer get away with the numerous &quot;I said, he said, she said, Hank said&quot; which continues throughout the story. I am listening to an unabridged reading by Kate Forbes which is excellent except for the use of these &quot;I said, he said, etc.&quot; Hasn't anyone else picked up on this?

There was so much about this book that was wonderful, the bond of her family, the crabby Ma richards, and the drunk Timmy, which also showed the change in Hank.

Interesting only for its historical setting, and even that is not enough to hold the book. It seemed to consist of Julie's long and constant descriptions of household chores and hard work. It reminded me alot of the way that feminist theory has evolved - as an examination of the lives of women through the chores that they perform. But that is not a solid basis for a fiction novel, and probably lost on most people. Particularly those that rightly believe a book should HOLD INTEREST."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"This book gets off to a good start. The writing is good, the characters start off interesting and it seems the plot is going somewhere. But as I got to about page 200 (or 2/3 through the book) I began to wonder what the author was trying to say. What's the point? That life is hard and you just have to get through? I read one other review that complained that the character of Julie never changed. I have to agree with that. There was no growth for her througout the book. There was no character development, at least for Julie who is supposed to be the protagonist. And when you don't see growth in the character, all the hardships that are thrown in - the fire, the flood, the death of a child - they all seem pointless. I have to admit though, some passages were a joy to read for the description and the words used alone. But that doesn't make a book. Others liked this book. It left me scratching my head."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"Robert Morgan did an excellent job of describing the period of the book. While this was not one of my favourite books, I did enjoy reading it.I can't imagine living in a time where even the simplest thing was such a difficult task! Morgan accurately portrayed the period that the book took place in, and painted a clear picture of the work involved simply to &quot;get by&quot;.Julie loses her Dad at a fairly young age, and she is expected to take on the brunt of the work, specifically the chores that would have been done by the man of the house. Julie and Hank meet, fall in love and get married. I think that Julie thinks that life will be somewhat easier for her once she is married. She and Hank move to Gap Creek, and she is suddenly faced with the reality that she must do as much or more as she did before. It is the story of a hard life, and of a marriage.I would be interested to read what had happened to Julie and Hank 30 or 40 years from the end of this book."},{"Title":"Gap Creek: The Story Of A Marriage (Oprah's Book Club)","review":"I love novels about mountain people, and Gap Creek by Robert Morgan is the best one I have read yet!

No matter how bad I felt, I couldn't have been worse off than Julie. She had what we would think was a miserable life but, since she didn't know any better, it wasn't so bad for her. She did remarkably well with her resources and maintained her pitiful marriage. This was the &quot;story of a marriage&quot; and it was very well written. I'd like to see a movie made of it. My next book will be another Robert Morgan blockbuster...think I'll try The Truest Pleasure and see if it measures up. If you're feeling down and depressed, maybe wondering if your marriage/relationship will hold up, try reading this and see if it all still seems bad.

A couple of our members found it a little unbelievable that one woman should suffer so much tragedy. I (personally) think that the tragedys are possible because of the rural poverty stricken setting of this book and the youthful/uneducated Julie and Hank.We all found Julie to be a very strong willed (as well as physically strong) woman. She had a way of taking every obstacle and turning it around or at least making it tolerable. (I think her expectations were not too high.) It was so sad that she was taken advantage of by the lawyer and the &quot;heirs&quot; of the house they were renting.We all agreed that Hank was just a little wimp who was looking for a good woman to take care of him. Lucky he met Julie (and not one of us!).One of our members read the book while on vacation - it left her feeling a little guilty to be enjoying such pleasures when Julie struggled so much.It was very sad that she suffered the deaths of her baby brother and her father and then her own baby in such a short period of time.We felt the author did a great job describing the life of a very simple woman.

Taken advantage of by her family her entire life, by the time she marries Hank she has already learned at a young age the powers of restraint, love, commitment and patience. I think that this story is an example of just how extraordinary people can be when they put their minds to it.

Her work has been compared by Time magazine to Mark Twain and Bret Harte. Her brilliant, spare style compares favorably to the best of Hemingway's short fiction. Three of her short stories were made into successful movies, one of which (The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance) is a Western classic. Yet instead of standing high in the pantheon of American writers she is all but forgotten, with much of her best work out of print and unavailable, as is the fate of this outstanding collection of tales, \`Indian Country'.Johnson had many virtues as a writer. She researched her topic and got the details right. She had a spare style that used an economy of words to say exactly and only what needed to be said. While she avoided sentimentality, she cut straight and deep to the heart of the matter, always revealing the humanity in all of her characters and never treating them as clich&eacute;s. All of these virtues are prominently on display in this volume.The eleven tales in \`Indian Country' represent some of Johnson's very best work. Two of these stories (The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance and A Man Called Horse) were made into movie. All of them deal with the people and the reality behind the clich&eacute;s and the legends of the West. Five of these stories, (Flames on the Frontier, The Unbeliever, War Shirt, Journey to the Fort, and A Man Called Horse) deal with a subject that Dorothy Johnson may have captured better than any other writer - whites living among the Indians, either from choice, or as captives, and the effect this had on them, the Natives they lived with, and the families that they left behind. In The Prairie Kid and Beyond the Frontier, Johnson shows how incidents that might be spun into legend evolved from the simple toughness that was required for survival among frontier settlers. Scars of Honor and Laugh in the Face of Danger are tales of aged people who time has passed by but who still cherish secret memories from their Wild West youth. Warrior's Exile is built around a theme that is often prominent in Johnson's stories - the importance of an Indian's visions and medicine to his life and status within the tribe. And The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance is the ultimate tale of the less than noble truth that could often lie behind the heroic legends that grew out of the West.Each of the eleven tales in \`Indian Country' is brilliantly crafted, and several of them are simply unforgettable. This is a collection that you will come back to and read again many times. I consider this collection to be more valuable than are many histories of the American West for the information it contains on frontier and native cultures, and give it my very highest of recommendations; not only for those with an interest in the American West, but for all who appreciate beautifully written short stories.Theo Logos"},{"Title":"Three Boys and the Remarkable Cow","review":"If you are looking for a book with nice writing and good healthy stories this wonderful series is for you and your family.We must support this kind of publications even if we must find them used."},{"Title":"Online Marketing Handbook: How to Promote, Advertise, and Sell Your Products and Services on the Internet, 1998 Edition","review":"Updated for 1988, this is one of those books that is organized for easy scanning - a fact I really appreciate.

Mother Teresa shows her love of God and inspires the reader to serve with love, and not on a grand scale but by serving your neighbor and those in need. The book is a quick read.

This is truly a life-changing book that reminds us that we are called to serve Jesus in a way that is humble and humbling--to love as He loved, to serve as He served--in a way that glorifies God by letting His Light shine through us, lighting up the darkest corners of our world.

I have rarely been so touched by a book and I found myself crying at times because the message in this book is so amazingly beautiful.It is probably impossible to completely emulate Mother Teresa. She was so selfless in her interactions with the poorest of the poor. And yet by reading this book you may be convinced to do something big or small to help the world.\\"No Greater Love\\" is a book to treasure and to read again and again. It is truly one of the most inspirational books I've ever read. Reading this book is truly an expansive experience. Mother Teresa's words of love fill your own heart with love that you can then share with others.In all my years of attending church I can't remember anyone teaching me to pray the way Mother Teresa does in her first chapter. She then also speaks about giving, being holy, working to help the poor, forgiveness, children, suffering and death. She lovingly explores each topic while making it clear that she is serving Christ in all his distressing disguises.I think that reading this book could really change your life. You don't have to run off to become a nun to change the world.

I'm a Methodist and I see in Mother Teresa a true imitation of Christ. She reminds us of God's love and how God uses us to minister to one another.While I was growing up, people would call Mother Teresa a \\"living saint\\" (I grew up and still live in a heavily in a Catholic neighborhood). Recent evidence reveals that she sometimes wrestled with doubts and frustrations. This has actually enhanced my appreciation for her, in that I see Mother Teresa now as more a human being, who struggled along like the rest of us, and could relate with our faults and trials better than someone of superhuman constitution.Her feeling for the poor; that is the economically, as well as, spiritually poor, gives us all a lot to think about. Whatever religion you are, I am sure you can find comfort in Mother Teresa's gentle spirit:\\"I deal with thousands of Christians and non-Christians, and in each you can see such conscience at work in their lives, drawing them to God...If everyone were capable of discovering the image of God in their neighbors, do you think we would still need tanks and generals?\\""},{"Title":"No Greater Love (Walker Large Print Books)","review":"I have no words...

Let us begin with our family, with our closest neighbors. It is difficult, but that is where our work begins.&quot; I learned from Mother Teresa that God does not ask us to ditch it all and head for Calcutta or the local soup kitchen; He asks something harder. He asks us to live our lives inside out, where we are at. He asks us to love those in our own sphere, those in our own perimeters. Makes sense, I suppose. The change always starts at the core, at our heart, and seeps out from there. Makes sense it would touch first those closest to us...it's simply easier to keep a distant focus. This book did what I did not expect, it brought my focus to those closest to me. I've loaned it out so many times that I finally decided to get another copy for personal reference again.

I DESPERATELY needed &quot;counseling&quot; as I have feelings of guilt (I could have somehow done more) etc. My Veterans Administration Psychiatrist in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, USA spoke with me about 1 hour and then recommended I read NO GREATER LOVE by Mother Teresa. At first I was a bit reluctant, because as a Protestant I &quot;pre-judged&quot; the book would be for Catholics. MAN WAS I WRONG!! This is absolutely THE BEST book, besides the HOLY BIBLE I have EVER read. Mother Teresa puts it &quot;where the rubber meets the road&quot; so to speak. It has been the GREATEST &quot;self-help&quot; book I have ever seen, if you really want to deepen your spiritual life. It DOESN'T focus on &quot;religion&quot; but rather focuses on JESUS CHRIST.

Her simplicity and depth of faith are evident through these reflections. The book also contains an interview with Mother Teresa and a short biographical sketch. There is also a thought provoking forward by Fr Thomas Moore."},{"Title":"No Greater Love (Walker Large Print Books)","review":"Mother Teresa speaks in her own words on subjects such as Prayer, Love, Giving, Poverty and Suffering. Her teachings are presented without adornment, in simple English. This remarkable lady believed in serving God by serving others--the poorest of the poor. She founded a worldwide order of sisters who live in poverty among the poor they serve, and who treat the poor with the respect and dignity that they sorely need. She did not believe in \\"evangelizing,\\" except by service and example. As a result her missionaries have been accepted and treated with great respect in remarkably diverse places throughout the world.In this slender volume Mother Teresa's thoughts are presented without commentary, footnotes or sources. Just her words, stunning in their simplicity. Stunning too in her literal application of Jesus' own teaching--to give everything to the poor--everything--and follow him.There is a brief interview with Mother Teresa and the briefest possible autobiographical sketch.

As I grew in my faith, I wanted to learn more about her, so I found this book.It is very well written and inspiring. Each chapter has a theme. It starts with two quotes: One from a saint or from Mother Teresa, and the other from the Bible. She then reflects on the topic - e.g. Prayer, On Being Holy, Poverty, Love, Jesus, etc. I felt that her combination of conversational prose, poems and prayers, anecdotes, and scripture was in perfect proportion for understanding her wisdom. For example, I felt she used Scripture perfectly to emphasize a point without it feeling like verses were just being \\"thrown around\\" just to use them. Similarly, she gives wonderful anecdotes from her experience with working with the poor which demonstrate her love and provide us with an example of how we can grow closer to God. Each chapter is about 6-7 pages long and the text is not too dense. I found each chapter perfect for reading in 10 minutes then reflecting and praying afterwards.This book is highly recommended to anyone looking to learn more about Christianity and Mother Teresa specifically. She will inspire you to live a holier and loving life."},{"Title":"No Greater Love (Walker Large Print Books)","review":"This is the best book I have read thus far this year.I was very impressed with the beleif system that Mother Teresa describes in this book.

Perhaps she will inspire readers to help others in some small way."},{"Title":"Great Eastern Sun","review":"&quot;The Great Eastern Sun&quot; is presented as a companion volume to Chogyam Trungpa's spiritual classic &quot;Shambhala: The Sacred Art of the Warrior.&quot;Both books were based on Trungpa's talks, but &quot;The Great Eastern Sun&quot; has suffered (or benefitted) from a much lighter editorial hand. The result is that the present volume preserves a stronger flavor of Trungpa's teaching style. On the other hand, the talks in this book were intended for a more advanced audience who were presumed to be already familiar with the material presented in the earlier book.My experience of Trungpa's books has always been one of a cumulative effect. It helps to read, to practice, to read again, and to practice some more. The extraordinary nature of the teachings grow clearer with time and practice, although sometimes very little comes through on the first reading."},{"Title":"Great Eastern Sun","review":"Carolyn Gimian has done a wonderful job of sculpting a body of work that speaks to the essence of Shambhala Training and warriorship. She has painted a genuine portrait of Chogyam Trungpa through his training methodologies, poems, talks, and personal history. The book contains reference information for those readers who may want to pursue Shambhala Training, in their own quest to embrace life through direct participation. I would recommend this book to all students of Shambhala, present and future."},{"Title":"Great Eastern Sun","review":"This book is a tough read, it becomes very tricky to piece together certain understandings. I would suggest reading it twice. But the profundity is there. I have not read any other Shambala teachings, but the &quot;Primordial Dot&quot; has been very intriguing to meditate upon. Along with the awakening from the &quot;shadow world&quot; of the autonomous mind; this parralels other buddhist teachings. A nice addition to any collection, the hardcover is bleach white with the great eastern sun symbol in gold. It complements my Art of War hardcover which is completely black and the same size."},{"Title":"Great Eastern Sun","review":"In her lovely Afterward, ed. Carolyn Gimian sensitively, yet honestly presents the life & work of Trungpa Rinpoche (TR)--context for the text's 21 (of 5000) TR talks: 2 public & 19 from 5th/final level weekend Shambhala trainings. Sections are different weekends; thus, some redundancy. It complements the prior \\"Shambhala: The Sacred Path of the Warrior.\\" Gimian preserves TR's personality, humor, crazy wisdom, & humanity, adding relevant pictures, TR's poems, a glossary, & index. TR well-describes the teachings: p. 212: \\"In & of itself, the Shambhala vision is not overly complicated or difficult. Often we see it & say, \\"Oh, I know that.\\" It feels like something very familiar to us. The real challenge is letting these principles penetrate our being & not letting arrogance & depression consume us. The Shambhala warrior knows that life can be simple. Yet these straightforward teachings have a profound effect. They are not theoretical spiritual exercises: they are pragmatic methods to help people raise their children, develop art, or run their own coffee shops. Through the years, the practical element of these teachings has become more & more powerful.\\"\\"Seemingly simple-minded teachings\\" include: meditation (p. 94), mantra (p. 202),DISCRIMINATING WISDOM--pp. 27-8: Discrimination in the Shambhala world means clear seeing or clear thinking.p. 51: When I came to [USA]...my 1st message to them was, \`Please be critical. Don't buy anything that somebody says. Question this. Try to develop critical intelligence.\\"BASIC GOODNESS--p. 234: In the Shambhala teachings, basic goodness is the concept of Buddha-nature.p. 124: the way to give yourself a good time is to be gentle with yourself. A lot of problems come from self-hatred. Let us let go of that.SERVICE--p. 13: It is about time that we become responsible for this world.p. 175: The main point is to help others be good human beings in their own way.And profound, delightful imagery/phrases: p. 123: \\"Listen to your own brook, echoing yourself & p. 153: The ordinariness of extraordinariness...ordinariness is extraordinary.\\" No wonder Gimian says p. 223: \\"Privately everyone reads him, although not everyone admits it.\\" Overall, the book is easy, relatively light, reading though it can be read on several levels.

More than anyone else, she has brought to the forefront the texture, darkness, light of the Victorian era, with its nasty social problems, its deep sense of caste, its range of crippling discrimination, its arrogance and cruelty - and the courage and stamina and wisdom of its common folks. This novel is no exception. Perry always takes a contemporary social problem of today, traces back to its origin or presence in the Victorian period, fashions a mystery around it, captures a reader's sense of outrage at that &quot;ancient&quot; abuse - and hopefully, reminds one of the continuity of that abuse to today. The focus this time is on a philosophy and a disdain and the ends some would go to insist on one's own truth.Whenever she comes! to town, my question to her is usually, &quot;What is your next book about?&quot; She always, remarkably responds, &quot;I am working on two now, and I think you will find the plots interesting.&quot; Her mind is as creative and active as anyone I have met. Amazing."},{"Title":"Brunswick Gardens","review":"In the late 1890s, what did it mean to be a woman in England? What did it mean to have a religious faith against Charles Darwin's new theory of evolution? Anne Perry at her finest draws the reader to experience what only one could have imagined. 10 years after Sarah's death in Cater Street, dashing Dominic Corde has taken the cloth of the curate, sharing the home with Reverend Paramenter and his family and Unity Bellwood, 'a new woman', who has a passionate belief in educating women, having the vote, and Charles Darwin. Religion and those who follow it are fodder for her mockery of such arachaic notions. So, who causes her violent death at the bottom of the Paramenter's staircase? Thomas and Charlotte must traverse through some of marriage's most difficult tests and examine their beliefs, when it appears as if Dominic might be the murderer. Jealousy, freedom to choose who one might wish to marry, passions that cause people to act and react, play an intricate ! part in this latest Perry, making the reader question are some choices worth dying or are desires and wants as useless as crying over split milk?"},{"Title":"Brunswick Gardens","review":"This latest Pitt novel focuses more on the characters' relationships, especially Thomas and Charlotte's than on detecting but rather than annoying me, I liked the exploration of the relationships. If you've been following a series with the same characters it's nice to see them fleshed out. The book's non-regular characters are also well-developed and interesting. It's not quite the usual Anne Perry fare, but it's a better book for it."},{"Title":"Brunswick Gardens","review":"I am a great fan of Anne Perry but had difficulty finishing this book. Perry's mysteries dealing with Thomas and Charlotte Pitt have recently been sliding in originalty and suspense. This book centers around the murder of Unity Bellwood, a classic's scholar who is found dead after apparently being pushed down the staircase in her employer's home. Charlotte and her usually familiar partners in detection are notably absent. Instead the book concentrates on the boring lamentations of the suspects in the house. I found the dialogue boring and there was no other action to speak of until the last fourth of the book. I am so disgusted with her recent caliber of writing that this one might be my last."},{"Title":"Brunswick Gardens","review":"This book is not at all Anne Perry's best book. It moved very slowly and dwelled in the psychlogical profiles of the characters too much. I was not able to finish it. Definately a waste of time."},{"Title":"Brunswick Gardens","review":"Sadly, Anne Perry seems to be losing enthusiasm - this latest in the Charlotte and Thomas Pitt series started off badly and degenerated into a boring and tedious read. The usual cast of characters that were vividly portrayed in the previous Pitt books either made cameo appearances (Aunt Vespasia and Charlotte's mother, Caroline) or were conveniently absent (Charlotte's sister, Emily and her husband, Jack). Perry seems to have gotten hung up on the issue of militant feminism in this latest book, and this has severely impacted the &quot;detecting&quot; aspects that were present in her earlier books in this series. But all is not lost - Pitt's boss, Cornwallis, appears to have fallen in love - with the wife of a Bishop no less! Is this an echo of what happened to Pitt's previous boss - he fell in love with, and married, a widow? I hope that Anne Perry does better with her next Pitt book. Me - I would prefer Lindsey Davis's Falco series any day."},{"Title":"Brunswick Gardens","review":"In 1891, Thomas Pitt has been named Commander of London's Bow Street Police Station. His current investigation involves the suspicious death of Unity Bellwood, a pregnant woman, who died from a fall down a set of stairs. Though most people, including the renowned Vicar Ramsay Parmenter, insist this was an unfortunate accident, Thomas thinks a murder has occurred.Thomas decides that there is enough cause to continue the investigation even though pressure for a fast solution is immense. He begins to uncover secrets about Ramsay, the man's alienated son, and the curator that makes both of them look like possible suspects. His spouse Charlotte, attending social functions, provides Thomas with additional data. However, before he can reach a substantiated conclusion, a second murder occurs. This forces Thomas to expedite the investigation before anyone else is killed.The eighteenth Thomas Pitt, late Victorian mystery is a fascinating novel that will be thoroughly enjoyed by fans of the series as well most historical fiction readers. Thomas remains an interesting character and the insight provided about his spouse and their relationship immensely adds to the reading pleasure. Though Anne Perry's story line is not quite at the level of some its predecessors, BRUNSWICK GARDENS remains a great book.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Brunswick Gardens","review":"It's been a long time since I had read an Anne Perry book. Not sure why except that there are so many other books I also want to read. Anyway, my friend gave me a box of books that included this Charlotte and Thomas Pitt novel. Good to read more about this delightful couple in mid-19th century England.The characters are the best part of this novel which unfortunately drags in spots due to all of the characters' eternal, internal going over and over the possibility of others having committed the murder and/or the affair that apparently led to the murder. Thomas' investigation goes on slowly, but the interesting part of it is that the prime suspect in the murder is his former brother-in-law, a man Charlotte had been infatuated with until he married her sister. The sister died many years earlier and Dominic disappeared afterward until suddenly appearing as a minister in the house of his Church of England mentor where the murder takes place. Thomas still has ulterior motives in seeking evidence that Dominic is the killer.The twists at the end of the story took me by surprise; I had things sort of backwards and I suspected the wrong person. Reading Anne Perry again was great fun, even through the lengthy musings, because the characters were so unique. I think I'll have to throw out my copy of this paperback because it's falling apart, but that tells me I'm only the latest of many readers to enjoy this book. I recommend it to historical mystery fans."},{"Title":"Brunswick Gardens","review":"I gave this book two stars because I'm a loyal fan of Anne Perry and have come to care about the characters, but, frankly, this book just isn't worth the money.

Dominic Corde--such aninsensitive cad in the Cater Street Hangman--turns up here in the lastplace you'd expect to find a man of his calibre--and he's a likely suspect in the first murder case in this outing. Unlike some of the other readers, I didn't really mind that Emily was on vacation and Great-Aunt Vespasia was only in one scene. Life's like that, folks. Hey, you give me a choice between going to Rome and meddling in a politically nasty murder investigation and I'll say, arrivederci, baby:) Dominic is definitely the center-stage, pivotal character in this book. Everyone in this book except maybe Gracie, Tellman, and the Pitt children has been deeply affected in some way by what he was, is, or is perceived to be. I've reread this book three or four times just to savor the wonderful interplay between Dominic and Thomas, as well as Charlotte's coming to terms with her past feelings for Dominic--a perspective that also proves pivotal as the book draws to a close.

First of all, the book is a photostatic copy of a 1911 MORONIC romance novel. The publisher has chosen to publish it with pictures of law books on the cover. Since this book has nothing to do with the law, it can only be interpreted as an intentional marketing misrepresentation. If this is not outrageous enough, the book has approximately 40 or more pages of text that is completely unreadable. It is a steaming pile! I immediately contacted the distributor and told them that if they did not immeidately refund my money I would crucify them and they will never sell another book on Amazon.com. However, all of that aside, after sending them a very acidic e-mail about how they violated me, they told me they would refund my money within 24-48 hours (which has not happened yet) and that I could keep the book for starting a fire or whatever. This is absolutely the worst I have ever encountered when buying a book through this website. I have purchased other books which were listed as \\"in good condition\\" and have received them with underlining and highlighting in them, but they were all still very readable. Although the condition was debatable between \\"poor\\" and \\"acceptible\\" depending on your appreciation for books. I no longer purchase \\"used\\" books through any of those distributers.

What makes this guide of literary terms different from others, is its comprehensiveness. Abrams goes into great detail on the important terms that one comes across most often in literature. There is information on theories and movements in criticism and terms such as modernism and post modernism, are clearly defined. there is also material on symbolism, metaphor and other figures of speech and so on.

The way that terms are defined makes sense to everyone, not just the avid writer or reader of literature.For example, look up 'Heroic Couplets' elsewhere and you'll find broad, vague definitions with little or no description. Well, think again when it comes to Mr. Abrams version of interpretation. Also, the way the book is structured is clever in itself. When looking up one definition, it leads to other words that are unknown, thus making full use of the book.If you have any desire to write or just want a better understanding of what terms are being thrown at you in text, consult this gem.

There are little essays on all major literary terms; those which can only be understood in their context are included in essays of a different heading (e.g. &quot;Bildungsroman&quot; is one of the terms which are explained in the essay about the &quot;novel&quot;). At first sight this may seem a bit complicated, but in the long run it is a lot more efficient than the usual dictionary-style presentation.Of course an advanced student of literature may sometimes miss some details - but those are details nobody would remember anyway. Mr Abrams only gives you the facts you really want to know and memorize. And he does this in a style of remarkable clarity and fluency. While this proves him to be a member of an old school of lit crit, the Glossary contains good introducitons to recent trends as well (postcolonial studies, gay and lesbian literature etc.)I am thankful that I didn't have to study literature without Abrams' Glossary!"},{"Title":"A glossary of literary terms (The Rinehart English pamphlet series)","review":"This is a very well-researched encyclopedia covering almost any literary term that comes to mind.

This glossary is special, with a good index of terms, one for authors, and dense, usable, clearly written articles with further reading, its form is unchanged since it first appeared in 1957. The 8th edition I purchased opens with the Absurd and closes with Wit, Humor, and the Comic. The articles are articles, not just key terms defined, but developments traced and contextualized.

During the time of the second French invasion of Italy (1499-1512) Machiavelli was part of the Florentine government, and engaged intensely in the art of statecraft. His great masterpiece \\" The Prince \\"was written when he was already outside the world of power. His hope was that it would get him back into a position of influence.As Butterfield understands him Machiavelli truly was a Machaivallian one who having studied experience, and learned from History from the wisdom of the ancient Romans provided in 'The Prince' a 'text for usurpers'.Butterfield talks about Machiavelli's demand that the Ruler be consistent in cunning, more scientific in the study of statecraft. He shows how Machiavelli seems to believe ' that anything be done if the welfare of the society' is in question including deception in the art of war. In discussing the Machaivellian model of right political action Ceasar Borgia, Butterfield says that what Machaivelli 'loved was something like the dialectic involved in Caesar's adaptation of means to ends-and the efficacy with which this was achieved in the world of actuality.\\"In this work Butterfield also provides commentary on Machiavelli's historical critics."},{"Title":"Flight to Mons","review":"Wonderful adventure about Britain's small military airships of World War I. Prolific Fullerton is reknown for his accurate technical detail, and he gives you enough here to put you uncomfortably in the open-air cockpit of a hydrogen-filled blimp hunting submarines at 6,000 feet over the English channel and on into occupied France for a little espionage. Brave men, flying with no parachutes (few available yet) in what amounted to a biplane's fuselage, stripped of its wings, suspended beneath the highly-inflamable (even explosive) gas bag by a series of occasionally unreliable wires. With the primitive forecasting of the day, the weather could be their worst enemy. These machines exist only in photos today, and not many of those. But quite a lot of historical material is on the Web about the little and big airships, which were improved from about 1913 until the 1930s when airplanes had advanced enough to make the blimps fairly impractical, due to their dangerous hydrogen gas. Think of the Hindenberg disaster, and others less well known."},{"Title":"Flight to Mons","review":"Flight to Mons, by Alexander Fullerton is the story of a flight in a small British naval airship from England into enemy held France. The story held my interest for the length of the book, and not just because of the action. Alexander Fullerton is able to generate interest in the technical aspects of lighter than air flight, and brings to life the dangers faced by the crews of these airships. Sometimes making it back to the ground, and safety, by the smallest of margins. Remember, in those days there were no parachutes issued to military air crews.If you are a Fullerton fan, you will love this book. If you are not yet a Fullerton fan, this book should change that!"},{"Title":"Practical Gods (Poets, Penguin)","review":"Dennis received the 2002 Pulitzer Prize for this colleciton."},{"Title":"Practical Gods (Poets, Penguin)","review":"This collection of poems is a gem. Mr. Dennis explores, from both religious and secular perspectives, issues of practical concern that touch all of our lives such as faith and its absence, paths not taken, regret, envy, forgiveness, happiness, and living a life that we can be proud to claim as our own, particularly in the face of multiple and often conflicting standards. For example, in &quot;Guardian Angel,&quot; he illustrates how happiness often hits indirectly, &quot;Like losing oneself in a casual conversation/ That tests our powers of empathy, not cleverness.&quot; In &quot;Pride,&quot; he embraces self-esteem, suggesting that it can open our eyes to the good in others, even if it doesn't enable us to see in ourselves the virtues others find in us. He considers in &quot;Department Store&quot; whether the moments we covet in others' lives aren't &quot;...only a truce/ In a lifelong saga of border warfare,&quot; a saga similar to our own struggle to not envy and be proud of who we are. In &quot;Not for the Idle,&quot; he explores why the books of those persons often mistaken as idle, &quot;Lined up on their desks, don't look like drinks/ Lined up on a bar...&quot; In &quot;The God Who Loves You,&quot; he suggests that peace can be found between the life we have and the life that might have been by recognizing the former as the life we've chosen. These are lines from just a few of my many favorites. I have read these poems four and five times, both because they are simply beautiful and because I can tell that Mr. Dennis has thought long and hard about these issues and I want to make sure I catch every insight he is conveying. With each read, I develop a greater appreciation for how exceptional his work is. These poems are reflective, honest, intimate, and rich in compelling metaphors, analogies, irony, and humor. I might add, as an additional compliment, that poetry is usually not my cup of tea, but Mr. Dennis's perceptiveness, as well as his writing style, which is never pretentious, captivated me from the start. So if you happen to be reading this Mr. Dennis, thank you!! Thank you for an extraordinary collection of poems and for the insights and inspiration they have given me."},{"Title":"Practical Gods (Poets, Penguin)","review":"Dennis is not a &quot;difficult&quot; poet, but he has perfected a wonderfully flexible, almost conversational style of versification which artfully conceals a highly pondered structure. He relies on enjambment to propel the reader from one line to the next, allowing the ironies to blossom almost as if by chance, as he spins out &quot;what-if&quot; scenarios over which his own rueful intelligence presides like a benevolent deity. Dennis' &quot;practical gods&quot; arise from the texture of our everyday lives, and wish-fulfillment reveries, but they are also religious entities, vehicles for prayer."},{"Title":"Practical Gods (Poets, Penguin)","review":"I do not generally like free verse as a rule. I hoped that a pulizter prize winning collection would help me gain a better appreciation of the genre (figuring that, with a Pulitzer, my appreciation would be on trial rather than the skill of the poet). I had to force myself to read the works through a couple times but after the fourth read through, I have started to favorably appreciate many of the works. I still am not devoted free verse fan, but there is no denying Mr. Dennis is skilled at his craft and he has me warming up to the genre. I'd purchase the book and give yourself some quiet time to ponder his work. If it takes an effort I believe it will be worth it."},{"Title":"Practical Gods (Poets, Penguin)","review":"I just heard a poem, read by the Author on the Jim Lehrer hour program and heard he won the Pulitzer prize.The poem was a wonderfully insightful look at our relationship and questions, and fear of gods wishes for us - pointing out that we may actually be living the life that is best for us.The life we chose.Bravo. And Congratulations Carl. I ordered 6 copies for myself, and my Christian friends. Perhaps they too may discover the god within themselves ... the one that really gets things done on this planet.

It arrived speedily and in excellent condition."},{"Title":"Practical Gods (Poets, Penguin)","review":"While this poetry is unlikely to appear in anthologies a century from now, Dennis has captured well the faith, doubts and concern for meaning in our age. A few poems require academic knowledge of poets and religious beliefs of other eras, but on the whole these poems are acceptable to the general reading public.His poetry is written in comparatively long lines with a conversational rhythm. Unlike some writing in such a style, however, his work is not prose broken into lines but rather carefully crafted poetry.The strength of the poetry is often in the cohesiveness built from disparate parts. Dennis is able to connect ancient mythology, Japanese poets, Biblical references, Moby Dick etc. to our contemporary lives.Examples, \\"Sun Rise\\" begins with the Aztec human sacrifices only to move to the Jewish diasporia's revolution from temple sacrifice to a religion of the books. Or \\"Eternal Poetry\\" which explores prison reform while insisting it is not a topic appropriate to poetry. \\"The Serpent to Adam\\" is a surprising evaluation of what was (or was not) lost in the fall of Adam. \\"Prophet\\" uses the story of Jonah to explore the work of a prophet in our own time, in soup kitchen."},{"Title":"Practical Gods (Poets, Penguin)","review":"&quot;Practical Gods&quot; names some of our modern day gods such as materiallism, mixes it with Christianity, and classical mythology for a wonderful blend of poems. i haven't read any of Dennis' other collections, but his blend of humor and seriousness is excellent."},{"Title":"Practical Gods (Poets, Penguin)","review":"My book club recently decided to take a month off from novels and nonfiction to read poetry, and one of the members read a few from this volume.

For instance, why should I care when this guy writes a poem about a novelist friend of his whom he supports? Hey I have friends who do things too. & Carl Dennis does do some clever things with rhythms, but I can't believe he's one of the greatest living poets. How did he wiggle his way so far into the spotlight? Personally I disagree with many of his quasi-logical statements anyways, even while I can appreciate what he's trying to do with them.

These vignettes touch on ethics, organizational dynamics, content, tools, business communications, and communication issues among others. This text will prove most useful to the prospective technical communicator who may not have any previous experience or concept of what the job entails. This text might also prove useful to novice technical communicators as the stories offer advice through humor, moralistic tales, \`horror' stories with happy endings, and explicit and implicit advice. Each selection is preceded by a brief biography to give a more human focus to the stories. While the text might prove useful and comforting for new or prospective technical communicators, readers who have more experience with technical communication might not find the text as useful. This text is part of the Allyn &amp; Bacon Series in Technical Communication, and as such is probably most appealing to students and educators involved in academic programs focused on technical writing rather than the practicing technical writers in industry."},{"Title":"Writing a Professional Life: Stories of Technical Communicators On and Off the Job (Part of the Allyn & Bacon Series in Technical Communication)","review":"This book defines what technical communicators do on the job.This book will appeal to teachers, possible future technical writers, and generally anyone interested in technical communication. The realistic narratives offer valuable insight into defining technical communication employment from a technical communicator's point-of-view. As beginners in the field of TC, the text offers various definitions of TC and provides examples of common problems encountered in the field. The three sections of the book are divided into portions depending on work experience. This is helpful because comparisons are available regarding TC beginners and seasoned veterans along with those in between. Problems covered in the text include: Power struggles between co-workers, technology inadequacies, struggles for TC job definitions and authority within the organization, adapting to the organizational culture, coping with the perils of consulting vs. salaried positions, positive and negative collaboration, finding a voice and respectability within a corporation, and gaining recognition in said corporation.Overall an excellent read answering many questions posed by beginning technical communicators."},{"Title":"Writing a Professional Life: Stories of Technical Communicators On and Off the Job (Part of the Allyn & Bacon Series in Technical Communication)","review":"As the author of one of the twenty-three narratives that appear in this book, I would like to explain what I think its purpose, its role, might be. Not many people outside the industry know what a technical writer is or what he or she does for a living. This book explains that and more. It illustrates, using cleverly disguised real-world examples, what work -- and life -- is like for a technical writer.

Savage and Dale L. Sullivan, attempts to define technical communication with a narrative structure to students and people with an interest in becoming technical communicators. With a collection of narrative stories, the book is very helpful representing and teaching the field of technical communication through experience. The authors of the narrative stories carry similar characteristics to that of the audience, as well as reflect the ideas and mindset of the audience. In addition, the writing reflects the authors' personalities. The book's organization of different sections parallels and correlates to the field of technical communication.

It was a personal look into the life of TC people, providing an awareness of some of the issues that a TCer may encounter and some approaches to solving the problems if they arise.The intended audience appeared to be TC students who have never had on-the-job experience or who are trying to decide whether or not to do TC, as well as those already in TC who might gain from having insight into how other TCers operate. The book can be appreciated most by those already working in the field. They will be able to relate to the story real time...It's kind of a \\"this is what you can expect\\" book...not a typical text book.The book isn't designed to teach TC, but give a flavor of the TC life. There were no obvious typos and the language from the individual writers did not prove to be a stumbling block. It kept moving well. The book is nontechnical, even popular in style, with articles well written (understandable) and well organized (related to the section theme)."},{"Title":"Writing a Professional Life: Stories of Technical Communicators On and Off the Job (Part of the Allyn & Bacon Series in Technical Communication)","review":"\\"What exactly does a technical writer do?\\" In Writing A Professional Life-Stories of Technical Communicators On and Off the Job, twenty-three technical communicators discuss how they came to the profession, the daily challenges they face, and life beyond the job.Writing A Professional Life-Stories of Technical Communicators On and Off the Job was published in 2001. Editor Dale S. Sullivan conceived the idea for the book as a teaching tool for his undergraduate technical communication students at Michigan Technological University. Until this collection, there was no publication detailing technical communication from the professional's perspective, and Dale was having a difficult time \\"selling\\" the major to his students. He thought a group of narratives written by the people who actually do the work would be better than anything he could come up with. After putting out a \\"call for stories\\" through the Milwaukee STC, many emails, meetings, and phone calls, his idea became a reality. These informative and entertaining narratives comprise three parts: In Part 1, Initiation Stories, we meet several newcomers to technical communication. In Part 2, The Process introduces us to seasoned technical communicators firmly entrenched in the daily processes of the profession. In Part 3, Life On and Off the Job, we meet technical communicators with varied cultural and intellectual interests. Writing A Professional Life also has a Topical Contents that reads like an index of the challenges and concerns technical communicators face daily, from Office Politics, Collaboration and Teamwork, and Gender Issues to process-centered topics like Draft Review, GUI Design, and Software Documentation.I was fascinated to read about people so much like me. The first narrative I read, \\"What A Life,\\" was written by a technical writer living in Ann Arbor, Michigan, my hometown. She, too, was the first person in her family to graduate from college. Some contributors came to the profession with a love for literature and writing, but they realized that earning a living as a fiction writer was unlikely at best. They wanted to earn a living through writing and found technical communication a solution.The technical communicator in \\"Fluff\\" has been in the profession long enough to have the mention of his name followed by \\"is he still alive?\\" Although he has worked as a contractor for over twenty years and dealt with just about every brand of hostility out there, he remains committed to this profession because technical communication is in his marrow; it's not just a job, it's his identity.In \\"A Job Like A Tattoo,\\" a newcomer to the profession quickly learns that in addition to not being greeted by the development team with open arms, she's faced with outright hostility from a programmer. She learns how to handle intimidating coworkers and difficult SMEs and overcomes her original expectations of her job. In \\"Madame Mao In the Midwest,\\" we see what can happen at a great job for writers when incompetent editors and managers are allowed to reign. And in \\"It's Not Mark Twain's River Anymore,\\" we see that mutual respect and support from another writer on the team cannot overcome management's inability to see writers as important contributors to the company product. Sometimes you just have to move on.Some stories are all too familiar, such as not being allowed to participate in the project until the 11th hour. But hope springs eternal in \\"Diary of a Tech Writer,\\" where our hero jumps in at the outset of the project. She's regarded as an asset and a professional, and she isn't beneath bribing developers with fresh-baked chocolate chip cookies to meet deadlines.This represents only a sampling of the narratives in Writing A Professional Life. Whether you're a pubs department manager, a lone tech writer who's new to the profession, or a clueless scribe who stumbled into technical communication for reasons unknown even to you, you'll be entertained, informed, and validated by this collection. I immediately recognized that I was in the company of those who know what a technical writer does all day. So the next time someone asks you, \\"What exactly does a technical writer do?\\" point him or her to this volume of narratives from the experts. Or read it yourself when you need a reality check. You'll definitely find it in this collection."},{"Title":"Writing a Professional Life: Stories of Technical Communicators On and Off the Job (Part of the Allyn & Bacon Series in Technical Communication)","review":"The anecdotes in this book were written, I believe, by people who love their careers as technical communicators.

The detail in the descriptions is second to none, coming as it does from someone who worked on these ships and at the same time had a strongly intelligent interest in them.

The story told is heartbreaking in its blunt simplicity - the lead character, Virginia, is not sure where she is at first, or why she is there, and the reasons for her confusion become painfully clear as one turns the pages.The point of view changes abruptly from first to third-person, and this was disconcerting for me as a reader. This is the only reason that I've given the book four stars rather than five. As I consider it further, it may be that Ward chose this disjointed narrative deliberately, in order to establish Virginia's feeling of constantly having the world tilt around her.I suspect that even this grim narrative of institutional life is rosier than the reality, but this is terrifying enough. Dangerous patients, nurses who have grown immune to the suffering around them, and draconian \\"therapies\\" all play a part in Virginia's experience. Just the luxury of having a dry bed to sleep in, or an uninterrupted period of private time in a powder room, is enough to give her joy and the illusion that she is getting close to freedom.As the clouds start to clear for Virginia, the narrative becomes more crisp and I realized that she was inching back to the \\"real world.\\" I was rooting for her to make a complete recovery and to resume her life.Sadly, Mary Jane Ward was hospitalized three more times after the institutionalization that inspired this novel. I understand that she still managed to write several books, including two others that reference mental illness, and I am now keenly interested in those stories."},{"Title":"The snake pit (Signet book, P 2496)","review":"This would be the second copy of The Snake Pit that I've purchased as a gift for friends. It's a fantastic read. Great period piece if you're a fan of the 1930's/40's, but the writing and characters stand the test of time and the plot lends itself to a contemporary feel. I'm surprised that no one has modernized the 1948 movie (also a classic and worth checking out).Read it!"},{"Title":"The snake pit (Signet book, P 2496)","review":"I agree that this is an interesting, personal perspective on life in a public mental hospital in the era before before deinstitutionalization. The book is easy to read and hard to put down. It avoids the trite idealization of the all-knowing therapist and complete, explainable recovery that you see in the movie- a more realistic portrayal of mental illness and its treatment is provided instead. Still, keep in mind that even this more realistic version of \\"Juniper Hill\\" has much better conditions than most public institutions of the day. The author makes this point herself in her follow-up book, Counterclockwise."},{"Title":"The snake pit (Signet book, P 2496)","review":"Going down into the Snake Pit with Virginia Cunningham, an amateur novelist with plenty imagination, is an exercise in being trapped. The events that take place and the people encountered drive Virginia sideways, backwards and diagonal before allowing her any forward progress. The writing gives the feel of participation, as if you the reader are a patient inside the mental institution with Virginia. You experience her feelings of agitation, vulnerableness and instability. Snake Pit is not a feel good book as the voices both real and imagined get into your head.The Snake Pit is an exercise in finding one's way out of a dark place full of nightmarish treatments and untrustworthy fellow passengers. The fear, uncertainty and longing to get out and return home to normalcy with a loving spouse, away from the institution's carnival of lost souls, starts to become a distant, hopeless fantasy. V. Cunningham, the patient, holds the key to not only her release but yours. The closer she gets to unlocking the door, the more fearful she becomes of pleasing her husband and the world outside. Meanwhile, you the reader are ready to leave immediately upon arrival. Like I said, not a feel good story, but one that's very unique in its telling and hard to stay away from. Because of the difficulty and confusion in reading the early parts where Virginia is not sure where or who she is, it takes extra effort on the reader's part to stick with her through the disoriented episodes.After reading Snake Pit I agree with this statement in the book:You wanted to get well. You never had a conscious moment in which you were not aware of being sick. You could no more, while conscious, forget your sickness than you could forget to breathe. Asked your greatest wish in life you would have replied at once - sanity. While people in the outside world longed to be millionaires, movie actors, club presidents and even novelists, nowhere, but nowhere save in a madhouse, did mental health get its share of prayers.\\"Long ago they lowered insane persons into snake pits;they thought that an experience that might drive asane person out of his wits might send an insaneperson back into sanity.\\""},{"Title":"The snake pit (Signet book, P 2496)","review":"Snake Pit is a good read if you want insight into the world of the insane. I never understood what actually set off the madness in Virginia Cunningham (was it her husband's inability to show concern or adequately provide - or was it before her actual marriage when she lost her first love)? What happened that first landed her in the hospital and then a mental institution? How did shock treatments help her cope and what behaviors set off the need for &#34;packs&#34; to bring her back into the real world? I know this is a period piece and things were done differently then to treat the ill and this is why the book was an interesting read. I never felt Mrs. Cunningham was anywhere near well but I couldn't tell how actually sick she really was. It was a snakepit!"},{"Title":"The snake pit (Signet book, P 2496)","review":"It's hard not to envision the Oscar-winning movie while reading Snake Pit, but the book provides less Hollywood romance and a greater sense of the protagonist's disorientation. Her struggle to swim toward sanity's shore is palpable. The prose is terse but not always gripping; yet it convinces. An insightful, personal documentation of psychiatric institutions in its day and of mental illness in any era."},{"Title":"The life divine (Sri Aurobindo International University Centre collection)","review":"This is a difficult book to read. Let us be under no illusions about that. It is verbose, repetitive and massive in its scope: tackling virtually the entire gamut of issues that philosophy traditionally deals with. But by the time you have finished reading the book (it took me three months to finish)it would have transformed the way you live your life. You may not agree with Aurobindo, and in fact, he probably does not want you to blindly agree with him, he would much rather that you think things out for yourself; but one thing that he certainly does is to question the 'commonsense' view of the world: the view of the world that we build up using bits of unexamined,untested, received, 'truths'. Take just one such 'truth': We believe--or at least we have done so ever since Descartes--that Matter and Consciousness are two separate things. Aurobindo puts forward the suggestion that the two are actually one and the same entity, only they are in different states being: somewhat like Ice and Steam being different states of water. If we concede that matter may be a form of consciousness, only in an inert state, all sorts of consequences would follow: especially with regard to our attitudes towards the environment.As I had said earlier, the scope of the book is massive. Its three parts can be roughly divided into Ontology (where he discusses the Nature of the Cosmos), Epistemology (where he discusses the nature of Knowledge (&Ignorance;), and the problem of Evil--which he attributes to Ignorance: a consequence of Ahamkara or ego-centricism) and finally, in the last part, he provides a broad, general direction for living our lives in accordance with our revised view of the world (Ethics). However, the book is not tightly structured (If you are looking for a book like Wittgenstein's Tractatus you will find yourself truly frustrated) it is loose, repetitive, and disjointed. Possibly because it was originally written as a series of essays and published monthly in a magazine called the Arya (between 1914 to 1919). He must have had to repeat himself because his original audience would have forgotten a point that he would have made five years ago. But the cumulative effect of the repetitions is that his ideas have a tendency to gradually seep in and sink into your mind, rather than strike you as a sort of brilliant epiphany.Aurobindo's philosphy is ultimately rooted in ancient Hindu Vedic thought. In the course of the book, Aurobindo tackles Marx, Darwin, Nietzche, Freud, Hegel, Feurbach, (plus a whole range of European philosophers) and his idea is to adapt their philosophy to the 'Truth' as expressed by the Seers of the ancient Vedas. Does he succeed in doing so? I don't know. That is for professional philosophers to decide. For me, the book has been a revelation, the scales have dropped from my eyes: I see things differently now. Hopefully, I will continue to do so for a while before the snares of living in a modern city finally engulf me once again. Haven't they said that we can't stand to face the truth for too long?"},{"Title":"The life divine (Sri Aurobindo International University Centre collection)","review":"Sri Aurobindo, a contemporary of Sage Gandhi, helped to compliment Gandhi&#8217;s works and message to India and the World. Whilst Sri Gandhi preached non-violence and world peace, Sri Aurobindo also left his philosophy to serve humanity evolution. If Martin Buber were alive, I would recommend him to read it in addition to his own &#8220;I and Thou&#8221;.I am indeed humbled by my rating. I can only say it is meant for sharing with patrons how dearly I treasure it, the rating is not meant to rate the sage Sri Aurobindo and his &#8220;Life Divine&#8221; --- for example, how does an elementary student rate Einstein&#8217;s works?Starting from the very first page, I wonder how the written meta-materials could have originated from a homo sapiens mind. It seems to me, the wordings in written physical form is a limited tool employed, but was the best available for Sri Aurobindo at that time.The work, originally a compilation of numerous contiguous articles, comprises 3 Parts:Book 1 Part I Omnipresent reality and the universeBook 2 Part I The infinite consciousness and the ignoranceBook 2 Part II Knowledge and the spiritual revolutionOccasionally he quotes, he mentions Names, it is not an extension of any sacred texts, be it Hinduism or others; it is not a set of spiritual practice based on mystical symbolism e.g. Kabbalah. They are simply words emancipating from the Author, like crystal clear waters flowing naturally in a steady moving stream, with calmness, serenity and vitality, glistening with cosmic light of jnana.Last six chapters are the essence of the book, if you are intimidated by the volume size and really want to get something out of it with limited time constraint.Reading a 1100+ pages fiction is already no easy matter. And more than 1100+ pages of philosophy writing requests your persistency, and requires your thinking and assimilation in each page. It is not an exaggeration if it takes you a lifetime to read. After you finish the book to its last page, you start over if you may want to recall the chapters all over."},{"Title":"The life divine (Sri Aurobindo International University Centre collection)","review":"When I read The Divine Life over 15 years ago it turned my faith around very profoundly,- it gave me Faith. I was a teenager and I thought I was an atheist! I am reading it again today and find the same eternal breath of inspiration in it which I found then. If we need a new Resurrection from the Godhead Shri Aurobindo and his message in The Life Divine are the highest representation for Modern Times."},{"Title":"The life divine (Sri Aurobindo International University Centre collection)","review":"It has been said that no one can explain the process by which the Divine became the universe. It is explained here. It is said that no one can explain the meaning of life, including the myriad of details that explains its organization. It is explained here with great clarity, using the most beautiful of prose. It is said that no one can explain the purpose and future evolution of life on earth. It is also explained in exquisite detail.In sum, this is the most profound spiritual work of the last hundred years. If you have the patience, you can discover the answers to most of the major questions of life within the bounds of this book.This work is a synthesis of western evolutionary teachings and the most profound spiritual teachings of the East. And yet it is beyond even a synthesis of the two. It is a revelation of truth and insight never before expressed in all the annals of spiritual literature.There is no work like it on earth. The expression does not feel like something that is spiritual, as we've come to know that concept. Instead it feels &quot;FUTURE spiritual.&quot; That's so because he EXPERIENCED that supra-spiritual future in the present of his extraordinary life."},{"Title":"The life divine (Sri Aurobindo International University Centre collection)","review":"There are very few great spiritual classics that each century produces. The Life Divine is one of these great spiritual classics, one of the key spiritual studies of the twentieth center, perhaps of all time. There are few great mystics and enlightened masters who are able to express themselves in extensive philosophy and profound poetry. Sri Aurobindo was one of these, and the Life Divine is probably his magnum opus.The Life Divine is no mere call to a life of piety, asceticism or outward religious fervor. It is a call to bring the Divine as a force of higher consciousness into all that we are and do, both individually and as a species. The Life Divine unfolds a panoramic exploration of consciousness from the Absolute (Brahman), to the Cosmic Creator (Ishvara), to the individual soul (Jivatman), and all the realms of existence, manifest and unmanifest, known and unknown. There are few books that cover such an expanse and with such depth, direct knowledge and clarity. For those who want to widen their horizons and extend their awareness into the realms of higher consciousness, there is perhaps no other book that is as complete, comprehensive and challenging. Reading it requires both concentration and meditation of a very high order, but brings great riches of inner insight in return.As someone who has studied the main religious traditions of the world, and has written extensively on the traditions of India, this book has remained with me as life time companion. I recommend it to all those who are looking at the spiritual life as a quest for a higher consciousness and grace that can transform all that we do. One can continue to delve into the book for new wisdom and insight year after year. The Life Divine teaches us in depth about the great spiritual traditions of India, Veda, Vedanta, Samkhya, Yoga, Tantra and Buddhism, but from a view of practice and realization, and a seeking for the universal truth behind all these great teachings.Most notably, the Life Divine outlines the spiritual purpose of the soul and of our human lives. It charts a way to a future in which we can go beyond our current mentality of ego and strife to a world of Divine peace, bliss and knowledge. It charts the transformation of our species from a confused adolescence to the maturity of wisdom and grace. Sri Aurobindo shows how the Divine Shakti can descend into our minds and lift us to a higher level of intelligence as our natural state of existence. The book is perhaps the best study of the spiritual evolution of humanity, the evolution of consciousness in man and nature, which is available."},{"Title":"The life divine (Sri Aurobindo International University Centre collection)","review":"This book is the greatest achievement of Mankind!It is the greatest philosophical book ever written and in the best English Language ever written too.It is the Ultimate culmination of a 3,000-year-old Indian Philosophic Thought.Sri Aurobindo examines deeper than anybody ever did the Human Condition and treats with the utmost profundity,clarity,linguistic beauty,logical acuity,originality and imagination all the major questions of Life:Why is there something rather than nothing,what is the meaning of life,why are we here,where did we come from,what is our relationship to the ultimate ground of Being,what is the function of ignorance,suffering,pain,what is the Nature of the Ultimate Being.He surpasses Shankara,incorporating in his philosophy the Tantric idea of the meaningfulness and purposefulness of the Becoming,as well as all central elements of Buddhist Philosophy.In relating all these to modern man (Western and Eastern) and connecting everything together through the most plastic,expressive,exquisite language ever written,he achieves the Ultimate Synthesis of all philosophical and spiritual thought of Mankind.Although one needs to become accustomed to his unique language and expression ,as well as to spend initially some time in understanding the way he uses certain terms (some of his own creation,so that the Inexpressible could at least be hinted at),this initial investment of time will more than reward the serious reader in the end.Some,with whom I agree,suggest that one start reading the book from the chapter \\"The evolution of the spiritual man\\"(Book 2,chapter 24) and,after moving on to read the next two chapters too,to go back and start reading it from the beginning.These last chapters give an overview of his philosophy and are written in an easier language.\\"THE LIFE DIVINE\\" is itself one of the most pure EMBODIMENTS of the DIVINE."},{"Title":"The life divine (Sri Aurobindo International University Centre collection)","review":"If you are like me and reading and spiritual development have gone hand in hand in your life, then it is possible I suppose to name a handful of books that really made difference; and I suppose it is possible, if push came to shove, perhaps to name just one book or one author that made a difference. It is also possible, that when you look at your life you see a book or an author that stands out at a given time as of paramount significance. For me, reading Emerson in my early 20s was one such author/book. Reading him, doors flung open that I didn't know existed, and I still read him at least once a year; essays like The Oversoul, Circles, and others are timeless, beautiful statements of spiritual understanding. Years of reading great books went by, but none seemed to strike the blows that Emerson effected on my consciousness. Then in my late 30s I was introduced to Jane Roberts and her Seth books, and once again my mind was lifted beyond its ordinary field of vision by the authenticity of her work with such books as Seth Speaks, The Nature of Personal Reality, The Nature of the Psyche, and others. More great books intervened, Plotinus, St. Teresa of Avila, and others, but again none seemed to speak directly to me in the way that Emerson or Jane Roberts did. The reading continued, but I think that I had in the back of my mind resolved myself to sifting and finding gold here and there, as I tried to piece all of the insights from a lifetime of reading into some kind of a coherent picture of the nature of reality, why the beings of the earth (and I include animals) have to suffer so much, what we can expect if anything after death, and so forth. Indian thought had always impressed me with its genuineness, even though the ancient text seemed to obscure or poetic or foreign to speak to my heart and mind the way Emerson and Roberts did. Much reading lead to Radhakrishnan, the once president of India and a great writer on spiritual matters, and Radhakrishnan led to Sri Aurobindo. I told my wife the other day that I wished that I had discovered Aurobindo when I was young, but I am fully aware that if I had I would not have read for long; his writing is too complicated and philosophical for the young mind, and for the average reader I suppose. But I have to say that it is the work of Aurobindo that stands out as the most significant of my late middle years of spiritual exploration in books. Jane Roberts, as Seth, once said that there are rare individuals that are born completely conscious, many of whom you might not recognize as you go about your daily life. I am not sure if this appellation applies to Aurobindo, but he is the only person I have read during my lifetime that combines the spiritual insight of the mystic and the ability to put his visions into understandable, if difficult, language. Emerson had the insight but chose to employ a method of expression that was more poetic than systematic. The Life Divine runs more than a thousand pages and at times I found myself wishing that he had written a pithy article that communicated his essential points rather than the nuanced arguments that this book represents. I would imagine that most people that begin this work do not finish it or get very far, which is in my opinion a pity: it is the most outstanding philosophical-religious work that I have ever read. If you are interested in a more practical application of his ideas (which are based on his personal insights and from extensive reading of the ancient Indian texts, the Vedas, the Upanishads, and the Gita, all of which he has commented on extensively in separate books) then I suggest his book The Synthesis of Yoga, in which he discusses the traditional Vedanta ways of aspiring to a union with God or with the spiritual reality within us. But it would be better to begin I feel with The Life Divine. The effort required to read him will repay itself in value beyond measure. He is a great genius and a great soul.What is his main message? Look within; the within of things is endless. God or Brahman or All That Is (Plotinus and the Neo-Platonists, the tradition in the West that most closely represents Vedanta in the East, call the Divine Reality the One, as did Aurobindo) \\"is within everything that you can perceive with your senses,\\" to use Jane Roberts words, and this \\"primary motive force\\" (again Jane) \\"has a reality independent of its connection with the world of appearances.\\" Your Inner Self, like everything else, is a manifestation of this inner spiritual reality, and this Self, possessed of the freedom and self-awareness and joy and energy or power and will and creativity and goodness and beauty of All That Is (see Jane Roberts \\"The Nature of the Psyche\\"), is without limits. All dimensions of all realities are psychological and the \\"barriers\\" between them are fluid."},{"Title":"The life divine (Sri Aurobindo International University Centre collection)","review":"I came to this book in the beginning of 2008, after studying Advaita Vedanta for 1.5 years, and having studied spirituality and philosophy for many more. I had gotten good results with other books I had studied (including works by teachers of Neo-Vedanta and works by Nisargadatta Maharaj and Ramana Maharshi). I had even been granted a Samadhi experience lasting a few days, but ultimately, by the time I had first read this book, I was left confused and frustrated. Too many teachers asked me to turn my back on the Mind, but I find that, for better or worse, my mind is not easily quieted until my sense of logic has been satisfied. Unfortunately, I had found too many logical inconsistencies and shallow explanations in the books I had been reading, and these were getting in the way of any true progress.I wasn't until taking a tutorial on Vedanta with my Philosophy professor that I was introduced to this book, and at first I resisted it. It seemed so inconsistent with all that I had read before. I viewed it as entirely too verbose and \\"caught up in the Mind.\\" I didn't understand it all upon my first reading. Luckily, I had my professor to review it with me. By the end of the semester the genius of the book was gradually beginning to dawn on me.Having re-read the book now once in it's entirety, in addition to periodic chapter reviews, I can say with confidence that it's the best, most enlightening, most life-affirming, most illuminating book I have ever read. Not just in an intellectual sense, but it has also completely altered my spiritual life, bringing me to internal realizations and revelations I didn't know were possible. I have read The Upanishads and The Bible, and as wonderful as they are, they have not done for me what this book has. This is a true work of art; not many nonfiction books (if any) can tackle the entire nature of reality and explain it in way that is almost poetic. Many times while reading I could only shake my head incredulously, marveling at the beauty and depth of his words and insights. It is a book that fills me with gratitude; gratitude towards Aurobindo, that he should have gifted the world with such a masterpiece, and gratitude towards that force, that consciousness, which should allow such beauty and wisdom to be expressed through Man. If this sounds effusive, I assure you: this book is just that good.Whereas other books on Vedanta can seem nihilistic, denying both the world and the individual, this is incredibly life-affirming and even joyous. It answered all of my previous questions on Vedanta, and then answered most of the major ones raised by the well known Western Philosophers as well. My professor, who had first picked up this book in India some years ago (he assured me that he didn't absorb it all in his first reading, either), told me that he could not find a flaw in Aurobindo's logic.I find it interesting that now that I have had more realizations (not of the mental sort, but from direct experience of the Infinite Self), I can go back to those books that I had once found illogical or nihilistic and totally understand and even agree with their perspectives. However, such understanding would not have been possible without reading the thorough explanations I found in this book first. For me, my mind has to be satisfied before it can let go and allow the Self to take over.The Life Divine was (and continues to be) a challenging read, not just in scope and writing style, but in ideology. The rewards were worth it however; it has made me a happier, wiser, and daresay, a more enlightened person."},{"Title":"The life divine (Sri Aurobindo International University Centre collection)","review":"Rating this book is like rating god for his creation-a joke of first order.

Logistics overcome, comes the barrier of prejudice; several of them: India, Hindu, Ashram, Philosophy, Spirituality, New-Age etc. But what is needed is an absolutely open mind and the book becomes a pure Life's User Manual.The book itself is a Univeresity that breathes universality. During the course of reading, one gets attuned to many related areas and ideas by way of allusions and comparisions. It also solves progressively one's long-held doubts and discords. Besides, in whichever profession one is, it helps to improve on the practical aspects. Further, the poetic beauty of the text enhances the sheer pleasure of reading even while the insights gained expands one's sense of mundane existence.

Both Aurobindo's vision and integral yoga had a great appeal on me. The life divine, which I read twice, is an outstanding book, I enjoyed it very much and it was very inspiring. Aurobindo wrote several other books that are admirable.What I find to be lacking, though, in the many reactions on his work, is a critical side. And this critical input is not directed particularly at The life divine, but at Aurobindo's vision as a whole.Beside all the positive effects, I have had unclear difficulties in 'moving on' while I was absorbing his philosophy and his practical spiritual psychology. Something seemed 'not straight' but I could not pinpoint it.Of course this is just my personal experience. Yet I do think there is something in the writings of Aurobindo which inclines to invite certain problems or pitfalls.His writings are very idealistic (several ideals are proposed to be pursued); not doubting his yogic experiences, still his vision is idealistic. Though his writings are not the child of the normal 'human mind', it is a product of a higher or enlightened mind. So, still it is a (mental) fabrication, which brings with it, I believe, inherent flaws, though it is presented in a sphere of flawlessness.He creates an extensive theory/vision; he objectifies and reifies a lot. Maybe too much?When he writes about 'God' and 'man', for example, does he present 'God' and 'man' as (self)existing entities?(By presenting them as self-existing entities, does he not create (divisive) problems he will have to solve himself later?)He does not present his vision as merely a means (upaya), for curing (the ignorance of) aspirants.His vision is not only a means (for liberation) but it also pretends to portray 'what is', the way reality is constructed.Besides its idealist side, his vision has also an elitist and perfectionist aspect (which is partly inherent to an evolutionist view). Though idealism and perfectionism in themselves are neutral, they create pitfalls that should be addressed.These pitfalls are easily overlooked because they are at the subject-side of the subject-object dichotomy.Ego-inflation is a risk, as always, but here it seems an increased risk.The pitfalls are not in the content of the vision but in the effect of it upon the reader/subject/aspirant.There's a subtle 'noble ego' that remains out of sight.I consider it a serious flaw in Aurobindo's writings that he does not explicitly address these pitfalls that are created by his own vision.[He does address all sorts of pitfalls in practice, but not explicitly pitfalls that arise because of his own vision and method.]When I read Aurobindo extensively, I thought: what should I read after Aurobindo? Not able to imagine something 'more superior or adequate'.I am still grateful for having read his writings, but years later, I have found seemingly more lasting inspiration (and, I would say, proper deconstruction) in the traditions of (mahayana) buddhism, advaita vedanta, taoism, and zen buddhism, with which I was already familiar, but now I delved into them anew.These teachings (though similar in many ways) are significantly different from Aurobindo's philosophy, mainly in 'not believing in positive knowledge'.Aurobindo seems to build; but these other traditions mainly deconstruct (as a means) without really replacing it with something positively stated, and without being nihilistic.(Books I would recommend are: Lex Hixon's Mother of the Buddhas, Nisargadatta's I am That, also Ramana Maharishi, and Thomas Cleary's translations of Taoism and Zen Buddhism.)I found it difficult to express my point, mainly because it is subtle and not yet completely clear to me, but also because English is not my first language.Yet, when half of it is sensed by the reader, I am content.The life divine is a great book. Reading it can be very rewarding.And: I think one's way of dealing with idealism (and the effects that aiming at spiritual ideals can have on oneself/people) should be an explicit theme for anyone who dives into the writings and vision of Aurobindo.I greet you and conclude with a quote (with encouraging flavor, because 'mind is not all') from Savitri:'If Mind is all, renounce the hope for bliss;If Mind is all, renounce the hope for Truth.'"},{"Title":"The life divine (Sri Aurobindo International University Centre collection)","review":"I have been studying The Life Divine for over 40 years and am continually amazed at how much more there is to be understood each time i return to it.

There is perhaps no other book that i have ever read that provides such a breadth of view, clarity of wisdom and understanding and which continually helps one to broaden one's own horizons and understanding. I recommend this book highly to seekers, philosophers and practitioners of yoga. I am especially impressed by the fact that it is non-sectarian and thus can aid the seeker regardless of the path of development or religion one follows.

There lies our destiny and the liberating key to our aspiring, but troubled and limited human existence--inevitable because it is at once the intention of the inner Spirit and the logic of Nature's process.The appearance of a human possibility in a material and animal world was the first glint of a coming divine Light,--the first far-off intimation of a godhead to be born out of Matter. The appearance of the superman in the human world will be the fulfilment of that distant shining promise.The difference between man and superman will be the difference between mind and a consciousness as far beyond it as thinking mind is beyond the consciousness of plant and animal; the differentiating essence of man is mind, the differentiating essence of superman will be supermind or a divine gnosis.Man is a mind imprisoned, obscured and circumscribed in a precarious and imperfect living but imperfectly conscious body. The superman will be a supramental spirit which will envelop and freely use a conscious body, plastic to spiritual forces. His physical frame will be a firm support and an adequate radiant instrument for the spirit's divine play and work in Matter.Mind, even free and in its own unmixed and unhampered element, is not the highest possibility of consciousness; for mind is not in possession of Truth, but only a minor vessel or an instrument and here an ignorant seeker plucking eagerly at a mass of falsehoods and half-truths for the unsatisfying pabulum of its hunger. Beyond mind is a supramental or Gnostic power of consciousness that is in eternal possession of Truth; all its motion and feeling and sense and outcome are instinct and luminous with the inmost reality of things and express nothing else.Supermind or gnosis is in its original nature at once and in the same movement an infinite wisdom and an infinite will. At its source it is the dynamic consciousness of the divine Knower and Creator.When in the process of unfolding of an always greater force of the one Existence, some delegation of this power shall descend into our limited human nature, then and then only can man exceed himself and know divinely and divinely act and create; he will have become at last a conscious portion of the Eternal. The superman will be born, not a magnified mental being, but a supramental power descended here into a new life of the transformed terrestrial body. A gnostic supermanhood is the next distinct and triumphant victory to be won by the spirit descended into earthly nature.The disk of a secret sun of Power and Joy and Knowledge is emerging out of the material consciousness in which our mind works as a chained slave or a baffled and impotent demiurge; supermind will be the formed body of that radiant effulgence.Superman is not man climbed to his own natural zenith, not a superior degree of human greatness, knowledge, power, intelligence, will, character, genius, dynamic force, saintliness, love, purity or perfection. Supermind is something beyond mental man and his limits, a greater consciousness than the highest consciousness proper to human nature.Man is a being from the mental worlds whose mentality works here involved, obscure and degraded in a physical brain, shut off from its own divinest powers and impotent to change life beyond certain narrow and precarious limits. Even in the highest of his kind it is baulked of its luminous possibilities of supreme force and freedom by this dependence. Most often and in most men it is only a servitor, a purveyor of amusements, a caterer of needs and interests to the life and the body. But the superman will be a gnostic king of Nature; supermind in him even in its evolutionary beginnings will appear as a ray of the eternal omniscience and omnipotence. Sovereign and irresistible it will lay hands on the mental and physical instruments, and, standing above and yet penetrating and possessing our lower already manifested parts, it will transform mind, life and body into its own divine and luminous nature.Man in himself is hardly better than an ambitious nothing. He is a narrowness that reaches towards ungrasped widenesses, a littleness straining towards grandeurs which are beyond him, a dwarf enamoured of the heights. His mind is a darkened ray in the splendours of the universal Mind. His life is a striving exulting and suffering wave, an eager passion-tossed and sorrow-stricken or a blindly and dully toiling petty moment of the universal Life. His body is a labouring perishable speck in the material universe. An immortal soul is somewhere hidden within him and gives out from time to time some sparks of its presence, and an eternal spirit is above and overshadows with its wings and upholds with its power this soul continuity in his nature. But that greater spirit is obstructed from descent by the hard lid of his constructed personality and this inner radiant soul is wrapped, stifled and oppressed in dense outer coatings. In all but a few it is seldom active, in many hardly perceptible. The soul and spirit in man seem rather to exist above and behind his formed nature than to be a part of its visible reality; subliminal in his inner being or superconscient above in some unreached status, they are in his outer consciousness possibilities rather than things realised and present. The spirit is in course of birth rather than born in Matter.This imperfect being with his hampered, confused, ill-ordered and mostly ineffective consciousness cannot be the end and highest height of the mysterious upward surge of Nature. There is something more that has yet to be brought down from above and is now seen only by broken glimpses through sudden rifts in the giant wall of our limitations. Or else there is something yet to be evolved from below, sleeping under the veil of man's mental consciousness or half visible by flashes, as life once slept in the stone and metal, mind in the plant and reason in the cave of animal memory underlying its imperfect apparatus of emotion and sense-device and instinct. Something there is in us yet unexpressed that has to be delivered by an enveloping illumination from above. A godhead is imprisoned in our depths, one in its being with a greater godhead ready to descend from superhuman summits. In that descent and awakened joining is the secret of our future.Man's greatness is not in what he is but in what he makes possible. His glory is that he is the closed place and secret workshop of a living labour in which supermanhood is made ready by a divine Craftsman.But he is admitted to a yet greater greatness and it is this that, unlike the lower creation, he is allowed to be partly the conscious artisan of his divine change. His free assent, his consecrated will and participation are needed that into his body may descend the glory that will replace him. His aspiration is earth's call to the supramental Creator.If earth calls and the Supreme answers, the hour can be even now for that immense and glorious transformation.~ Sri Aurobindo"},{"Title":"The life divine (Sri Aurobindo International University Centre collection)","review":"I am an avid reader.

Aurobindo had the unique ability to perceive special things in this world that most people cannot; more importantly, he also had the special ability to put his thoughts into lucid written arguments and explanations. In this work, he outlines the purpose of evolution and what it's next stages are: mainly that we have achieved greater levels of conscious at each stage with the ultimate realization of the divine here on this planet as the final goal. For example, consciousness has developed from dumb matter to simple life, from simple life to complex animals, from complex animals to the human mind. Now what will unfold is the development of even deeper levels of consciousness in the human being that will allow us to attain even higher heights.While a very challenging read, this book will inspire you to strive for more in life as it will give meaning to the un-understood urge to attain perfection. This book completely changed my viewpoint on the world and life and has redefined my direction. While I have not drastically changed my path, it has allowed me to better understand what my path is and therefore approach it even more ardently."},{"Title":"The life divine (Sri Aurobindo International University Centre collection)","review":"Sri Aurobindo's sentences are built of triple dependent clauses (without commas, he's an Oxford grad),but if you stay with him, follow the thread, you're a different person by the time you reach the period. He is pure genius. A gift from the Gods. His long sentences are a kind of meditation really; their gentle coaxing detail draws the inflated reactionary mind down to a still point.This book has changed my life. It pulls everything together; every thread of spirituality from the great thinkers and philosophers as well as some errant threads of my own imagination, and weaves them all beautifully, poetically,into something you can hold onto.Never felt comfortable with Buddha's assertion that the world is a total illusion; recoiled from violent denial of the body and pleasure. Sri Aurobindo points out the serious error of said positions. This is what I got from him:God, the Absolute Brahman, is REAL; He is all that IS real. There is nothing that is not Him, the infinitesimal quark as well as the immeasurably vast(apparent)void of space is God, the Absolute Brahman. Consequently, the universe of matter must be and is REAL; it is simply not the Ultimate Reality, the all inclusive Absolute--it's a dependent, secondary reality.God's consciousness/awareness is active, embedded, concurrently INVOLVED in every form of matter, which forms are all extensions of Himself and dependent on Him for their limited reality, subscribed existence. The body, the world then, are aspects of God, innocent matter; to be understood while not allowed to dominate, corrupt.Maya is a power of God, God's Maya, that emanates from Him. God's Maya conjures up matter, the universes; Nature is Her executive force. As a limited reality She, Maya, can be termed an illusion (certainly God is aware that She is), but for us who are ourselves limited realities Maya is effectively VERY REAL. She and Her active instrument--Nature, are expressions of Him, God. God is present as a silent hidden program, His conscious intent like a sleeper chip embedded in all matter.God being silently, secretly as it were, INVOLVED in matter--matter EVOLVES. Without apparent conscious intent (but this hidden program/knowledge /consciousness), Nature has propelled matter to the development of man, a Self-aware Consciousness, the highest evolution of matter.But man is not a done deal; from this point on the Consciousness itself must propel any further evolution; man must evolve spiritually. He must lift his head from the domination of matter(pleasure/pain)and initiate the embedded program that will open to a higher consciousness bringing man to face God as his father, and himself.Man must rise to divinity. This spiritual evolution is man's birthright, his responsibility, his only true purpose. Meditation is fundamental to the initiation and realization of man's sacred self. The superficial mind must be stilled to allow this god aspect in man, which was not deliberately hidden but has been naturally, necessarily submerged in the dense matter which had to evolve to this point.The time is now for mankind. (According to me, hahaha.) I feel that each human being has a secret assignment, a secret sacred role to play, but she must come close to God to know what it is. Meditate.Thank you, Sri Aurobindo. I love Buddha but you gave me a truer understanding of him. Buddha's teachings were concentrated, condensed to hyperbolic because his life was the lesson, a solar flare that commanded attention, challenged the status quo. The same with OSHO.

'Nevermore' primarily chronicles what defloration means to the women who have lost their virginity, to the men who take it, and the cultural logic behind its prominent importance in most societies. The analysis presented in 'Nevermore' carefully covers the origins of virginity, its representation in literature by both female and male authors, anthropological studies of its presence, the sexual morals of fairy tales and the psychoanalytic process of defloration for Western men and women. For anyone who is looking for an insightful look into the reason why virginity has maintained its relevance in modern day society, this is an excellent start to a very complex and interesting question. A very intelligent piece of work."},{"Title":"Nevermore: The Hymen and the Loss of Virginity","review":"it speaks about virginity and methods used to verify it it speaks about hymen as one of those method."},{"Title":"7 Keys to Changing Your Life, Health and Wealth","review":"This is an excellent guide book for those ready to change and a compassionate motivator for those still trying to get the courage to do so.

Asking himself the question &quot;why does C.Darwin spend so much time and effort rebuttalling the various arguments that the creationists present&quot; rather than a strict presentation of his views, the author walks through the intellectual life of Darwin as the first modern biologist who left one toe in the old theological-saturated world, that of a general theist.From pg 3 &quot;The positivist limited scientific knowledge, which he saw as the only valid form of knowledge, to the laws of nature and to processes involving &quot;secondary&quot;, or natural, causes exclusively. The creationist, on the other hand, saw the world and everything in it as being the result of direct or indirect divine activity. His science was inseparable from his theology. His epistemology was closely geared to a metaphysics, and in metaphysics he tended to be an &quot;idealist&quot;. To comprehend nature fully, for a scientist of this persuasion, was to understand the workings of the mind of the Creator.&quot;I liked the way he organizes around the epistemes/paradigms, in doing so he often presents the humanity of the scientists involved in the discussion, this makes the ideas so much more real as you realize that although the people are long dead, they are human in the conflicts and heart-break they went through to arrive at their beliefs, to write their books. Darwin especially comes across in the book as a human being, sympathetic but driven by the tenor of his times as much as he added to the pressure to switch epistemes with his thought. The consistent technique presented in the book revolved around his relationships with individuals whether through letters or reactions to books and the way his ideas and theirs fought, twisted together, or passed into oblivion depending upon the greater movement of ideological systems which emerged in the mid 19thC.The big take home message of the book is simple enough. It was Darwin's desire to free science from the miracles that by necessity are attached to creationism. Underneath this is the idea that miracles are violations of natural law and as such elements of the capricious, the mysterious, the unpredictable that he wished to ban from science, if not as impossible then at least as unscientifically explainable. A second major theme, the topic of several chapters is the relationship of design and purpose as underlying the old creationist episteme and the consistent attempt by Darwin to eliminate this type of thinking all together from biological explanations.Gillespie, as a historian, presents the ideas with an eye to the underlying forces that move people to certain ideas, this is akin to the &quot;ideas were in the air&quot; but more detailed. One push to change epistemes emerges in chpt 3 &quot;Darwin and positive science&quot; where he writes &quot;the new was asking question that the old could neither frame nor answer.&quot; pg 53 This is the effect on systematic thinking of the new data, the facts that flowed into Europe with the great voyages of discovery, Darwin's on the Beagle included. To much of the old thinking stopped with the &quot;God did it&quot; type of explanation, the utility of the new episteme was obvious in that it allowed, even drove deeper levels of explanation. It is these levels, this complex unification of disparagent facts where big important patterns emerge, where the new paradigm shines, it works to build laws and theories that have great explanatory and utilitarian power.On the question of design, &quot;But in giving up Paley's simple and direct empiricism for an idealism which substituted an intuitively perceived plan behind the adaptations for the adaptations themselves, the design argument was, to the positivist, on less relevant ground scientifically. It had, by abandoning the empirical world, removed itself from the area of science and entered that of religion. When, eventually, belief in design became an act of faith in an incomprehensible divine wisdom and its ends, the idea of design, ceased to have any potential value as a scientific explanation: its assertions were unverifiable and hence useless.&quot; pg 85 The argument in biology was how to eliminate the purpose that came so naturally to discussions of living things, for it is obvious that living things move and act with a purpose, from Aristotle on in western thought, biology was literally saturated with this purposefulness. Darwin's proposed mechanism of random variation-natural selection(becomes RM-NS in 20thC) was the first fully mechanistic technique proposed to chop off the link between organisms and their adaptation to local environments as a result of God's intervention. Once this link was severed there was nothing to stop the emergence of a fully positivist mechanistic biology to replace the Aristotle-biblical amalgamate that held sway in Western thought.I appreciated this book, a great deal of detail about how principles interact, how epistemes collide, how people work out ambiguities and intellectual paradoxes is included, especially using Darwin as an example. Access to historical information as in the details of letters passing between him and numerous thinkers with substantially different intellectual priorities, and how these conversations modified beliefs and moved people to think differently is excellent. We miss all this human touch when we read history textbooks were names never seem to be real people, this is perhaps the best personal satisfaction from this book."},{"Title":"Charles Darwin and the Problem of Creation","review":"Neal Gillespie's historical analysis of the triumph of Darwinism uses as a key element Michel Foucault's concept of the \\"episteme.\\" An episteme is something of a communal worldview, a collective set of presuppositions about knowledge, its nature and its limits. It is analogous to and yet broader than Thomas Kuhn's use of \\"paradigm.\\" The paradigm governs a specific field of science; an episteme, on the other hand, involves the idea of science itself, and what constitutes good science. \\"Paradigms guide research and epistemes provide them with the logic, metaphysics, and epistemology that make scientific work possible.\\"The nineteenth century saw the gradual decline of the creationist episteme in natural history and its gradual replacement by one of positivism until the transformation was complete at the dawn of the twentieth century. \\"The positivist limited scientific knowledge, which he saw as the only valid form of knowledge, to the laws of nature and to...natural causes exclusively. The creationist, on the other hand, saw the world and everything in it as being the result of direct or indirect divine activity.\\" The switch from one episteme to another in the scientific community was not instantaneous, but first required the growth of positivism within creationism itself.In the days of William Paley in the eighteenth century, the watchmaker argument was in vogue, where design was seen in the \\"contrivances\\" in nature, machine-like structures such as eyes and wings. At that time God's designing, purposeful activity was understood to be indispensible to a proper understanding of the natural world. However, even as the community of naturalists remained solidly in the creationist episteme, by the early nineteenth century positivism had crept into their thinking and changed the way they viewed their creationism. They no longer viewed God as a designer of contrivances but as the designer of the laws of nature. These laws were not autonomous but were guided by the Creator to permit the unfolding of creation over time. Though not subject to constant divine interference they were nevertheless tied to divine purpose. This was thought to be more worthy of God, more profound that he could steer the laws of nature to unfold creation, than that he had to constantly intervene in creation.The problem was, however, that when design was no longer located in contrivances themselves, but in the laws that led to the formation of these so-called contrivances, design lost the common-sense, intuitive appeal that it had formerly enjoyed. Abstracting design removed it from the everyday observations in science and really necessitated taking it on faith. Thus when Charles Darwin, who lacked the strong Christian commitment of his naturalist forerunners, published his Origin of Species in 1859, he saw only autonomous laws of nature and no need to postulate a designer for them. Perhaps he could grant God as some sort of first cause for these laws, but if there was a God he certainly wasn't currently involved with them.Darwin as a positivist recognized that the rival creationist episteme was utterly incommensurable with his. Creationism, though it was becoming more and more naturalistic, would never become positivistic, because it would never surrender the role that theology played in biology. Special creationists who advocated direct intervention in nature by God, had by and large given way to providential evolutionists in the second half of the nineteenth century. They did not understand why Darwin would not countenance divine guidance of evolutionary processes; this lack of understanding showed that they did not grasp the change in episteme that was taking place under their very noses. Though creationism seemed to have moved much closer to the views of Darwin, there was still an unbridgeable gulf between them.This explains why Darwin lashed out at special creation in the Origin to the extent that he did. He recognized that design and any form of divine guidance in biology made his mechanism of natural selection superfluous. The whole point of natural selection was to show that unguided natural processes could counterfeit the appearance of design. Clearly then, \\"the touchstone of positive biology, at bottom, was not law or natural causes, but the absence of conscious contrivance or purpose.\\"Those who made the epistemic switch to positivism found that more than their science was affected. \\"Just as science shifted from a theological ground to a positive one, so religion - at least among many scientists and laymen influenced by science - shifted from religion as knowledge to religion as faith....Christianity became hard to distinguish from theism and theism from a vague belief in some sort of spiritual dimension in life.\\"Darwin is unique among the giants in the hall of fame of science in that his fame arose when the theory for which he is famous, speciation through natural selection acting on random variations, was not generally accepted. Gillespie explains: \\"Darwin... found scientists becoming more and more positivistic, and made them aware of the implications of this for biology. He made them evolutionists; but ironically, he could not make them selectionists. It is sometimes said that Darwin converted the scientific world to evolution by showing them the process by which it had occurred. Yet the uneasy reservations about natural selection among Darwin's contemporaries and the widespread rejection of it from the 1890's to the 1930's suggest that this is too simplistic a view of the matter. It was more Darwin's insistence on totally natural explanations than on natural selection that won their adherence.\\"The triumph of Darwinian evolution rested on the prior triumph of positivism in the scientific community. Thus it was not the case that one scientific theory was judged more adequate than its scientific rivals; rather there was a change in the philosophy of science that no longer even recognized as scientific theories at all, what had been Darwin's rivals. Darwin, then, essentially won by default as the only scientific theory on the table. This way of doing science was, and is, not just a methodology, but rested on strong prior assumptions about reality."},{"Title":"Charles Darwin and the Problem of Creation","review":"Pegged around the twin themes of Foucault's epistemes and Kuhn's paradigms this cameo history places Darwin in the context of the Paley generation yielding to an age of positivism. This is a tale which is difficult to tell since the science bard chanting the mythical saga of the foundational moment seldom gets any further than epic mode in the stages of knowledge given by the Positivist Comte. Comte's stages, which people apparently took seriously, are highly misleading and don't correspond to a real picture of knowledge evolution. How speak of positivism if the result is a new myth for an age of science?But this is a good history of Darwin's period and the naive triumph of Darwin's too limited theory, whose main effect was simply to a banishing ritual for the design argument.That the division by episteme is oversimplified should be seen from the loss of substance in the period from Kant via Lamarck and Chambers to Darwin. The epistemic spectrum is reduced to the paltry pseudo-dialectic of the propagandists Darwin and Paley. Trying to overcome purposive explanation via natural selection was an imaginary triumph.The attempt to judge the issue of Kuhn is virtually impossible for one immersed in such. If ever there was a Kuhnian transition followed by frozen brain syndrome it was the Darwinian Revolution (with all due respect to Bowler's Darwinian Non-Revolution). In a word the positivist methodology was inadequate for the job.This is a good historical account in any case."},{"Title":"Manual del perfecto idiota latinoamericano (Spanish Edition)","review":"Soy un habitante de M&eacute;xico D.F.

However, after reading it, I have a hard time figuring out where to start criticizing it. There are several problems with this book. The main one is the lack of intelectual honesty, as the authors permeate the book with historical facts but forget to mention the causes behind them. For example, they mention an election where a candidate got 40% of the votes, but they forget to mention that this election was during a dictatorship! In fact, their account of history is so twisted that if we are not aware of the facts we may even end the book with the impression that Latin America is poor despite all the efforts of those who the \\"idiots\\" claim are their oppressors. We may end the book with the impression that we live in a world where nobody is exploited, and poor people exist only because they want to be poor. According to the authors's logic, some people are miserable because they want to be miserable. But they don't stop there. They claim that Latin America is poor only because, of course, Latin Americans are idiots. In brief, the message behind the book is well know: Latin Americans are inferior and like to be exploited; it is the duty of smart people to take advantage of that; and it is the fate of Latin Americans to be exploited, as their inferiority can only be changed by genetics. To support their point, the authors neglect the causes of Latin American history and hide obvious cases of exploitation and oppresion by relying on the fact that they are often exerted by subtle mechanisms. This book is indeed a Manual for the Perfect Latinamerican Idiot, as someone that believes on what is written in it would fall into that category. As for the authors, I could not classify them as latinamerican idiots, as they didn't write this text out of ignorance, but must have made a true effort to hide the truth."},{"Title":"Manual del perfecto idiota latinoamericano (Spanish Edition)","review":"Como siempre nos vamos a los extremos.

Before you read this book, please understand that a perfect idiot wrote this book.First of all Plinio Mendoza, is not a writer, he is simply a person who knows how tu push the keys in the keyboard, to the service of the Corrupted Politicians in Colombia. Very well known politicians in Colombia have paid him to write in a popular magazine, equivalent to Time or Newsweek, and to speak in his radio Show, to support their projects or to attack those who interpose in their way. The interesting thing is that he hides under a disguise of pseudo-intellectual, and cultural man.What does this guy has to do with politics? If you get the chance to read his writings in the magazine \\"Semana\\" in Colombia, you will notice that he only writes about politics once in a while, when the interests of certain political people are in the middle of an issue, the rest of the time he writes about culture, or history. His writing is not objective, he takes part and judges the ones he is not interested in.Reading this book gives you an idea on how a corrupted person as Plinio, can write and feed the readers with a distorted view of Latin Americans, trying to brainwash them.If you have the chance to read him, or watching him, you will know in that very moment, that the title of the book, applies only to himself.Read this other book instead: Autorretrato de Cuatro Idiotas Latinoamericanos by Juan Gabriel Labake"},{"Title":"Masters of Atlantis","review":"I never read Portis before, so had little to compare it with, but this book made me laugh out loud---quite an embarassment on the subway, especially when the spittle hit the PC keyboard of the woman sitting next to me.

So I was really ready for a good laugh at their expense and Portis more than measured up. The book is 248 pages of sustained hilarity. I didn't find it to be \\"over the top\\", as one reviewer mentioned. These characters may be a tad overstated, but you can find them in shopping malls, train stations, airports, state legislatures, TV commercials, talk shows, reality shows...they are all there and Portis has nailed them.

I immediately thought of the early fiction of T.C. Boyle. But then the book slowed considerably, with the only variation in pace happening when the character Austin Popper runs off to Colorado to seek gold. Way too many pages were given over to the Master Jimmerson character padding around his decaying temple in Indiana with his nose in a book and otherwise not much happening at all. Toward the end of the novel, it gets LOL again when Popper appears in front of some state senators in Texas to answer for the cult. But then the novel peters out again through the end.Two things would have made this a much better novel. 1) cut back the contemplative stretches where Jimmerson does nothing and add more action or at least remove the the long patches of slowness; 2) incorporate a good deal more of the specific oddball beliefs of the Gnomon society based on the real-life Atlantis cult books such as \\"Atlantis: the Antediluvian World.\\" There would be no need to include the title of that book, just the zany ideas it asserts."},{"Title":"Masters of Atlantis","review":"Masters of Atlantis is a masterpiece.

My father wrote to Charles Portis care of the publisher, telling him that our family has read the novel so many times, and asking him if he knew where we could find a copy. Portis sent my father a letter and a copy of the paperback edition signed \\"For Ray Russell, with Thanks, Charles Portis, Little Rock, Sept 7 1990.\\" In his letter, Portis wrote that the critics had mostly been baffled by the novel (unfortunately, Masters of Atlantis was not as commercially successful as his other books)."},{"Title":"Masters of Atlantis","review":"Granted, it's not for everybody, but Masters of Atlantis is one hilarious read.

Remember this from that same program of defacement?\\"He also commissioned a drawing of a pop-eyed, moronic human face, that of a collegiate-looking fellow with spiky hair and a big bow tie, and had rubber stamps made of it. The face had a strange power to annoy, even to sicken the spirit--one had to turn away from it--and Popper directed that it be stamped on every page of Hen's books, in a different place on each page so that the reader could not prepare himself.\\"That's just gas that is. I often thought that that particular face might make for an interesting cover but perhaps not, the actual result may have ended up looking like Alfred E. Neuman--\\"What, me worry?\\"--with who knows what lawsuits to follow. The newer paperback edition of Masters of Atlantis, published by The Overlook Press, is without question most welcome as an affordable reissue but the cover is a little unimaginative for such a deeply funny and off-kilter book. Still it's what's inside that counts in the end and what's inside this novel is the purest comedy gold. The unforgettable Dr. Reo Symes from the unforgettable The Dog of the South even shows up for a split second as a three hundred pound co-author of a book called Slimming Secrets of the Stars! That's the first and as far as I know only crossover of a character in the whole of Portis. Chapter 20 of Masters, where Austin Popper is questioned by members of the Churton Committee regarding the removal of the Master of Gnomons to La Coma, Texas, is quite simply priceless. Portis is generally pitch-perfect with his dialogue but here in this chapter his dialogue soars to the most outrageous heights. Just hysterical. Read the entire book through though is my advice, if you don't crack up on almost every page you can dust my muffins with arsenic. Or at least raise the Rod of Correction. Yeesh though, $1250 for a first edition? That's a lot of lettuce."},{"Title":"Masters of Atlantis","review":"I like this book because I'm a fan of conspiracy theories.

He founded this religion, and then the book goes off into what amounts to office politics as the main protagonist reconfigures the religion, gains or loses control of it and that was it for me.Unlike 'Norwood' and 'True Grit' both of which I enjoyed enormously, this book just didn't work for me. I suppose had I stuck with it, perhaps, by the end, some of the wit and wisdom Portis showed in those two other books would have surfaced, but for me, life isn't forever and I was bored completely with this flat fare."},{"Title":"Masters of Atlantis","review":"The predilection of humans to involve themselves in cults is a perplexing topic that requires years of study and stacks of dictionary-sized psychology books in order to understand.Or......you can just read Masters of Atlantis then move on to your degree. Charles Portis continues to hold me in awe with his deadpan comic genius. His silly plots read humorously on the surface, and move at a good clip, but suddenly one realizes that there is so very, very much more going on.Where do cults come from and why do (presumably) rational people involve themselves in the nutty things? Portis' take on the topic spells it out in plain humor: an accidental encounter, an impressionable young man, the hangers on, the manipulators, and, gasp, the true believer who spawns a whole philosophy derived from the antics of a con man. Strangely enough, he begins to discern subtle truths about the nature of the universe. When the government gets involved things get sillier yet, but don't just write this off as fiction, we've all seen Congressional hearings; Charles Poris has got their number.Line your Charles Portis books up next to your Kurt Vonnegut-they make great companions."},{"Title":"Masters of Atlantis","review":"The plots and themes are discussed well in the other reviews. So here is a testimonial instead.In the 1980s, I read this book with great pleasure, and then passed it along to a friend, as I always do. He read it, then correctly passed it along to another friend or library. Thus we shared our books among others, never planning (or even having time) to re-read them. A few months later we discussed this strange and wonderful book, which was full of characters in secret societies and factions thereof, using green ink, issuing membership cards--then stamping them VOID in a fury, conniving for leadership, etc.Most books are never worth re-reading, even if they are great: there are simply too many other good ones waiting for their turn. This one was clearly different: so we racked our brains trying to remember the title or author, so that we could re-read it.Years passed and we periodically tried to find this book. In the meantime, we discovered the book \\"Confederacy of Dunces,\\" the film \\"O brother, where art thou?\\" and the song \\"Shriner's Convention\\" all of which had similar odd characters, situations, and whimsy. After more than twenty years, my friend finally remembered the character \\"Sqanto the talking bluejay\\", and of course Google pulled this title right up.Thus we now possess copies which will be selfishly unshared this time. You'll need to buy your own copy, which you may well then treasure as a jewel of the English language; hopefully it will become one of your top ten lifetime books, as it did for us.You may even want to re-read it at some point--as I did.

We here in the USA are uncontrollably eccentric, maybe even just plain nuts: but we wouldn't have it any other way."},{"Title":"Masters of Atlantis","review":"What a total treat and joy to discover this terrific novel. I would put it in the same league as 'Confederacy of Dunces\\" and that is high cotton indeed. As another reviewer mentioned, the deadpan humor is maintained beautifully from start to finish. I understand why some people might not \\"get\\" Portis or find his books to be particularly funny. This genius will not be to everyone's taste. \\"Masters\\" is odd and it deals with marginal and strange characters and it's somewhat of an eclectic style of deadpan humor. If you haven't read any Portis, it might be best to start with \\"Dog of the South.\\" If that doesn't make you laugh, give it up. If it does, read everything the man wrote. It's all great and \\"Masters\\" is, I think, the best of all."},{"Title":"Masters of Atlantis","review":"I know the term 'best ever' is thrown out there too often and is in most cases downright cliche. But with this book, funniest book ever is an understatement. If you're a fan of deadpan, dry humor with witty dialouge and eccentric characters this book is for you. The first 50 pages are a bit slow in setting up the rest of the story, but from then on I was hanging on every sentence, not wanting it to end.The character of Austin Popper is one of the most eccentric, off the wall, and laugh out loud characters ever written.Let me put in the analogy of a movie. If you liked 'Royal Tennenbaums', this book is right up your alley. It has that kind of dry, acidic wit and tongue in cheek humor. If you're more of an 'American Pie' kind of person, you may be left scratching your head and wondering what the hell just happened."},{"Title":"Masters of Atlantis","review":"Arkansas author Charles Portis has sometimes been compared to Thomas Pynchon. On the surface, the comparison seems bizarre; Pynchon is known for his elaborate literary fantasias, and Portis is best known for the rip-roaring Western _True Grit_. Yet in _Masters of Atlantis_, a tale of secret societies, coded knowledge, and the strangely obsessed men who control access to both, Portis ventures confidently into Pynchonesque postmodernism, and walks away with nothing less than a great American novel.As you might expect, there's plenty of Portis's deadpan wit, as well as the usual fellowship of outcasts, misfits and odd ducks (most of them belonging to an obscure pseudo-scientific cult called Gnomonism). But beneath this funny business is the desperate quest for a definitive interpretive system, one through which these marginalized characters can finally make sense of the arbitrary, incomprehensible world around them.You'll have to judge the outcome for yourselves, because for my part, I'm not quite sure. I can say that the final revelation of Gnomonism, with all its ambiguity, is also unexpectedly poignant and satisfying."},{"Title":"Masters of Atlantis","review":"This book is an American classic, and many people will enjoy it. But speaking as a 14 year vetern of an occult fraternity, the scariest thing about the book is that it is really a lot like real life in the occult community!

Most people don't know it, but this book has been an underground hit in the Occult community, with copies being passed around and even pomas being made and worn!Buy it for the terrific humor and excellent writing, but if you're a member of an Occult group - buy it to examine yourself and your friends!"},{"Title":"Masters of Atlantis","review":"this book is one of my favorites ever. i just love how portis's accounting is so detached and even-handed, while what and whom he writes about are so absurd and pathetic.because portis doesn't try to write funny, the reader can absorb the outrageousness situations and dialogs in pure form. and those situations and dialogs are a riot.small caveat:while a lot of events happen, these characters never really grow or learn from the disasters they leave in their wake. there's no redemption or closure. although it spans decades, this book truly goes nowhere. if you can't handle that, you won't like masters of atlantis."},{"Title":"Masters of Atlantis","review":"In this thoroughly entertaining Charles Portis novel, Lamar Jimmerson is a member of the modern-day Gnomon Society, an international fraternal order dedicated to preserving the arcane wisdom of the lost city of Atlantis. While stationed in France in 1917, Jimmerson comes across the &quot;Codex Pappus&quot;, a small but sacred Gnomonic book crammed with Atlantean puzzled, Egyptian riddles, and extended alchemical metaphors. Soon basking in the lore of lost Atlantis, Jimmerson is convinced that his mission on earth is to administer and expand the ranks of this noble brotherhood. Masters Of Atlantis takes us through Jimmerson's publication of the Gnomonic texts, a scandalous schism that rocks the Gnomonic community, his disastrous bid for the governorship of Indiana, and a fateful gathering of Gnomons in the mobile-home park of East Texas. &quot;Must&quot; reading for all Charles Portis fans, Masters Of Atlantis is memorable, rollicking, fascinating journey into an America of misfits, conmen, oddballs, and innocents."},{"Title":"Masters of Atlantis","review":"I, too, think this this one of the very funniest books I've ever read.

I'm afraid that Iris hasn't had much luck with men. Her father died of alcoholism. She spent years loving a man her head told her was a gold-digger just using her for a doormat until his meal ticket came along, but her heart refused to believe until he did dump her to marry for money. Her husband, Randall, was quite decent at first. Iris was finally happy, but things have changed. Randall has turned suspicious and drinks too much. In chapter 3 he tells a story about his great-great grandfather who built his house that's absolutely chilling, especially the part Randall calls a refinement of cruelty one has to have been, or be, deeply in love to understand. Also chilling is the reason why Iris won't leave her husband, not that the stepdaughter who hates her knows it.Randall Nash has never been a knight in shining armor. He dumped the girl he was going to marry after her father lost all his money to a con man cloaked in religion. Randall married his best friend's rich girlfriend. They're still friends. From what we learn about the first Mrs. Nash, perhaps A.J. McClean has remained a bachelor -- and Randall's friend -- because of his narrow escape. The way Randall treats his only son because the boy chose to stay with his mother after the divorce is shameful. The nicest thing about Randall is what he did for his daughter when her mother took away Lowell's dog because of an incident that took place when Lowell, now 18, was only four years old.Our heroine, Grace Latham, who lives next-door to the Nashes, knows all about that incident because her elder son, who was three at the time, was the other culprit. What Randall did for his daughter is the reason Grace has always been a little fond of him. It was to Grace that Lowell ran when her beloved father remarried, but Grace doesn't hate Iris Nash. She's friends with Iris, which makes her (and through her, us) privy to a number of interesting confidences. It's also why Grace is present for the finding of the second body. So is Colonel Primrose, luckily for the innocent.I love the stories about Georgetown history and the descriptions of places -- except for that gruesome tale about Randall Nash's monstrous ancestor. If this were a ghost story instead of a murder mystery, it would be sufficient reason for a haunting. The discovery made during Mr. Nash's father's time would make a good climax. Barbara Michaels could have written it, except no ghost tried to prevent it.The racism and sexism of the time are hard to take, but it helps a little that the only bad apple among the servants is white. It also helps that Grace really means it about Colonel Primrose being safe from matrimonial designs where she's concerned, and Colonel Primrose wishes she weren't. I loved the 51 year-old Colonel's reaction to being innocently mistaken for 38 year-old Grace's father. The scene where Grace gets back at Primrose at the photographer's studio and Primrose gets back at Sergeant Buck, is fun.We readers can use the humor when there are so many grim or emotionally wrought scenes, such as poor Lavinia Fawcett's past and present. Sadly, there was no Social Services program to step in after the way her mother and older sister died. I wouldn't blame her brother for running away except that he wasn't around to help when Lavinia really needed him. Her back story is in chapter nine and makes a good reminder of why the notion that a man has the right to treat his family as he sees fit is wrong.In this book we learn that Colonel Primrose's yellow brick house is at 2491 P street. Grace's house is also on P street, across the street and a block away. She can see a corner of Primrose's house from a downstairs window in hers. The Primrose who built the Colonel's house was on General Washington's staff.The two sons we learned that Grace has are in this book briefly. We know the older one is either 17 or close to it because that incident with Lowell Nash took place 14 years ago, but both boys have dates, so the younger one probably isn't much younger. The author doesn't bother to tell us their names. It's Christmas Eve when the book opens, so it wouldn't have reflected well on Grace if her boys weren't around, I suppose. It's a pity that Grace wasn't around during the first murder, but she was on an errand of mercy. One of her friends can't get home from California in time to chaperone young Mary's house party in Virginia because her plane's delayed, so she asks Grace to take her kids there and be the chaperone. Interesting how long it took the 'friend' to get back...I like Grace. I like the fact that she nods in agreement when her African-American cook, Lilac, repeats a conversation she had with her husband, Julius, where Lilac said something didn't make sense and Julius replied that a lot of what Mis' Grace does doesn't make sense -- more doesn't than does. In chapter 18 I chuckled over what Grace got caught doing to the Bishop's cake when she was a child and how she was punished. Grace gets attacked twice in this book. I liked the way she reacted to the frontal attack. The attack from behind wouldn't have happened if she weren't a caring person.An earlier owner of my copy pasted part of a newspaper article about the author inside the front cover. The headline is 'Professor's Wife, Leslie Ford, Top Mystery Writer'. The author was Eleanor Griesemer. It opens with 'Annapolis, Md., July 17. -- (AP) -- . I'm sure you've seen those assurances that the characters are imaginary and no resemblance to any person, living or dead, is intended in many books. According to this newspaper article, Mrs. Ford K. Brown (the former Zenith Jones), once used a name from a 150 year-old English record in a book she wrote under her 'David Frome' pen name. A living solicitor with the same name collected damages for that. No, the article doesn't say how much.This is a good cozy for fans of old mysteries, and a good reminder of what our culture was like before some things became unacceptable -- though not universally unacceptable, unfortunately."},{"Title":"Requiem for a Ruler of Worlds: (Alacrity FitzHugh and Hobart Floyt, No 1)","review":"This is one of my favorite books.

Daley describes a fairly distant future in which I wouldn't mind living, complete with aliens, ray-guns, Galactic gypsies, flying bicycles, starships, automatic taxidermy machines, villains, heroes, and True Love. The main characters are a mousy little bureaucrat from isolationist Earth and a chaotic and flamboyant ABS (Able-Bodied Starman). Just good fun; very hard to put down.

While there have been a zillion alien invasion stories, this is a story about a man who lives on Earth in a post-alien invasion society where the aliens lost, but managed to totally decimate Earth: all major cities are gone, most major landmarks are gone, almost everything that we would remember is absolutely gone...Earth has fallen back on itself, wallowing in their past glory, with a xenophobic, communist/socialist government that, and it is the birthplace of outer space people that are no longer quite \\"human,\\" (like Alacrity) who brave anti-alien sentiments to make a pilgrimage back to their homeworld. In the case of Alacrity, who came to look at what's left of Earth's natural beauty, he gets framed for a murder of an Earther so he can escort Hobart Floyt, Earth functionary third class, on a mission to a distant planet to accept an inheritance from a recently deceased ruler of a 12(?) planet empire. Along the way, they survive several assassination attempts, many close calls, and a reporter who uses what she learns from talks with Alacrity and Hobart to write several books about fictional adventures that they are supposed to have, that Hobart would call \\"penny dreadfuls\\" (including \\"Hobart Floyt and Alacrity Fitzhugh in the Castle of the Death Addicts,\\" \\"Hobart Floyt and Alacrity Fitzhugh Versus the Brain Eaters of the Galactic Rim,\\" and \\"Hobart Floyt and Alacrity Fitzhugh Challenge the Amazon Slave Women of the Supernova\\"). Sound theories and speculations about the future that is interesting to think about (especially how popular Monopoly still is!

If you like Lois McMasters Bujold, you'll love this."},{"Title":"Requiem for a Ruler of Worlds: (Alacrity FitzHugh and Hobart Floyt, No 1)","review":"I'm disappointed to see that this fantastic book is out of print. Brian Daley's prose shines in this starfaring adventure that follows spacer Alacrity Fitzhugh (a pseudonym and a pun: say it out loud and you'll get a good impression of his character) and Hobart Floyt (a stolid Earth-dweller) as they wander through the galaxy, causing mayhem wherever they go. Though this book belongs in the buddy genre, it also subtly decries the xenophobia and racism of today: Earth in the future is an exclusive planet, terrified and contemptuous of the colonists who settled the stars. Alacrity comes back and is trapped into escorting Hobart to collect an inheritance left to him by the ruler of a distant solar system. As they travel togeither, they must overcome their dislike of each other as well as interference from those who do not want the mission to be completed. The series--Requiem for a Ruler of Worlds, Jinx on a Terran Inheritance, and Fall of the White Ship Avatar--is incredibly funny, written in Daly's clever, sarcastic, name-dropping style. It's great, believable science fiction, but the characters remain utterly human.

I have never read too much of this genre, so I'm not as picky as some others who have reviewed this title, I suppose, but I find the above qualities refreshing in a genre that seems to have been left to the &quot;experts&quot;, a situation that always ends up dull. My biggest piece of advice would be to buy all three books at once, if possible, free up a weekend and go for a great ride.

If you have ambitions to be a world traveller, reading Requiem for a Ruler of Worlds will help you overcome the initial terror of the absolutely strange. This is a great first book in a great series. It is an absolute tragedy that he will never write a fourth novel for this series, but each novel of the series is complete on its own. You just want more!"},{"Title":"Requiem for a Ruler of Worlds: (Alacrity FitzHugh and Hobart Floyt, No 1)","review":"These books explore the nature of unbridled humanity better than any other works of fiction I have ever read. I believe the real value of these stories lay not only in there entertainment value (of which there is plenty) but more so in just what excesses and horrors we people are capable of. Read Nazi Germany, The Inquisition, Adi Ammin, and then throw these and other cultures into space, let em go and you have these stories. If we ever get of Earth and settle other planets on any kind of scale this is what it will be like.... Then theres the metaphysics (or are they physics) of &quot;strange attractors&quot;. I personally believe in strange attractors and so do you. Seriously these are great books, five stars, read em."},{"Title":"Requiem for a Ruler of Worlds: (Alacrity FitzHugh and Hobart Floyt, No 1)","review":"With so little being written the is truly sci-fi one has to go back to the old classics and reread them over and over. This series of books was one my favorites.I enjoyed the humor, the settings in which each event took place, the flow of the story from start to finish and the fact it was just plain good old fashion sci-fi. Today most of the books in the sci-fi section are really fantasy which is not the same though some want you to think that. I rate this story right up there with all the best sci-fi written. Please bring it back for my children's sake and their children."},{"Title":"Requiem for a Ruler of Worlds: (Alacrity FitzHugh and Hobart Floyt, No 1)","review":"I came to this series knowing Brian Daley only from his Han Solo books, and was enormously surprised to find a very readable, very enjoyable book along the lines of classic SF from the 50's and 60's. Well-crafted prose, fun characters, and a genuinely intriguing storyline made this book hard to put down."},{"Title":"A History of the Popes 1830-1914 (Oxford History of the Christian Church)","review":"Chadwick ends his book by stating that \\"it had not been the expectation of historians that they would be treated as if their work was seen to have something to do with understanding the faith of the Churches\\". I daresay that Chadwick's work has plenty to do with a better understanding of the Catholic faith in the 19th and 20th Centuries.Regarding its content, the book's title is somehow humble. It includes far more than the history of Gregory XVI, Pius X, Leo XIII and Pius XI, it is a history of the Catholic Church in continental Europe in that period.Regarding its form, the book is a pleasure for any reader (I was delightfully surprised, for I knew his \\"Secularization of the European mind in the 19th Century\\", excellent too, but not at all engaging). I would point out, for instance, the ability of Chadwick,to vividly draw, with a stroke of his pen, plenty of characters, not only the popes (e.g., his description of Bismarck).Then, I do recommend this book to anyone (urbi et orbe!)."},{"Title":"A History of the Popes 1830-1914 (Oxford History of the Christian Church)","review":"Professor Chadwick continues his history of Christianity by relating the stories of the 19th century Popes and their largely unhappy coexistence with the forces of science, capitalism, liberalism, nationalism, and the like. Professor Chadwick's dislike of all the above gives him common ground with , for example, Pius IX.The structure of the book is straightforward and admirable. He begins in 1830 and goes to 1914, and stops. He makes few attempts to directly address any overarching themes. This is not to say that he shies away from generalizations. On the contrary, the book is awash with sweeping statements unsupported by notes. It reads like a very long example of the old Oxbridge weekly essay, and owes a good deal of its polish to the fact that it is not encumbered by the need to see the other side, or to balance one viewpoint with another.The result is sometimes troublesome. We know that Pius IX was not universally popular, but Chadwick is not one to tell us why: he leads us to believe that all who disagreed with the Pontiff were wicked and stupid. This could be an interesting and refreshing viewpoint if it were supported with facts. It is not. There were a number of factual errors in key places which made me uneasy.Chadwick, in his work on the Victorian Church, produced the definitive text on the subject. I had hoped that &quot;History of the Popes 1830-1914&quot; would be similarly authoritative. It is not that, not by a long ways. I did enjoy it, but I think it a book to be taken with a grain of salt, both for its failure to draw the larger picture, and for its surprising degree of bias."},{"Title":"Freedom Underground: Love, Honor and Betray","review":"The action of the book extends over a period of nearly twenty years, starting in Communist Romania, a country desecrated by Ceausescu's dictatorial regime. Alina Marinescu is a beautiful, talented young woman, whose views about personal freedom attract the unwanted attention of the Operative Directorate, a highly secretive organization created with Soviet assistance for the purpose of subduing any kind of opposition towards the regime, as well as and controlling internal and external Romanian politics. Divided in multiple sections, the Directorate's most important and covert division is Section Special Operations that monitors the activities of exiled dissidents associated with vocal critics of the Ceausescu regime, assassinating the most fervent ones in retaliation for their opposition to the communist doctrine. The SSO's operatives are the elite within Romania's secret police, the assassins. The favorite method of recruitment is to select new potential operatives from the large pool of political prisoners sentenced to death. Usually, in front of their death squads, they are given the alternative to join in exchange for their lives and the lives of their family's members. In this way, the SSO decides to recruit Alina by sending one of their best to persuade her into illegal political activities against the Communist regime she so vehemently opposes. Alex Stefanescu, a free spirit before his own recruitment and brutal indoctrination into an automaton assassin, quickly develops deep feelings for the girl and although he fulfills his mission to the letter, he does so halfheartedly. He is assigned to be her mentor during the training process, having to deal not only with her hatred, but with the implications and responsibilities of transforming an innocent human being into another instrument of death like himself, as well. What Alina does not know however, is that Alex is a double agent working for Elite Covert Counterterrorism Ops, a powerful and ultra-secretive international anti-terrorist coalition created by four Western powers with the intention of stopping the ever increasing threat of radical terrorism. When the SSO receives a clear indication that a mole might be operating within their structure for some time, Alex's only viable option is to flee, but not before recruiting Alina into Elite as a means to save her from an imminent demise. On their first mission as Elite operatives they must assassinate Ceausescu and with him forty-five years of tyrannical oppression, so that a well planned coup d'etat can successfully be implemented to eradicate the remnants of the Communist resistance in order to establish a democratically elected government. While Alina and Alex work as a perfectly synchronized team, their tense personal relationship is complicated by the many lies and betrayals standing firm between them. When they are forced to marry as a cover for one of their missions against a new rising power in radical terrorism named Al'Qaeda, the tension escalades into a wild sexual love-hate relationship that has Alina cringing in fear for her soul's integrity.Monica Danetiu-Pana has done an excellent job in neatly weaving together fiction with real life to produce a fast-paced terrorism thriller dealing with topics which are particularly pertinent to our time, giving le Carre a run for his money. The plot grows deadlier as it nears the end, describing the psychology of the Islamist fanatics in a way that is credible and deep. I found it not only enjoyable to read, but I came away with a better understanding of today's headlines. The final plot is completely unexpected and mind-blowing, the payoff tremendous. Part I is a real page-turner, I can't wait for the sequel!"},{"Title":"Freedom Underground: Love, Honor and Betray","review":"Wow!

Excellent read!"},{"Title":"Freedom Underground: Love, Honor and Betray","review":"Freedom Underground (I love the title!) offers a level of cultural and political nuance not always found in espionage thrillers. The main chracters Alina and Alex live on the edge, they're tough, vulnerable and haunted. The plot twists and turns in a web of suspense, subterfuge and ultimate vindication, through a shocking ending. The first volume is an utterly compelling thriller and quite simply the best I've read this year. Marvelously rendered and tantalizing, a suspenful drama of global intrigue with an exceptionally brilliant style. Where is the second volume? I want more!!!"},{"Title":"Freedom Underground: Love, Honor and Betray","review":"The book tells an incredible story of survival exploring the undercover world of espionage, part of the intelligence-gathering operations of nations and global organizations, revealing the true-life reality behind the aparent glamour. Regardless of its hard tone the love story between the two main characters Alina and Alex is trully unforgetable. The characters and their drama are so alive and shining, that they stayed with me long after I finished the book. I strongly recommend anyone out for a great read to get this one. You won't regret anything, except that the second volume is not out yet. I'll be the first to buy it!"},{"Title":"Freedom Underground: Love, Honor and Betray","review":"Tantalizing! From page one we are plunged into layers of intrigue that fan deeper and wider as the story develops, peopled by characters about whom we only want to know MORE. Freedom Underground is almost like the perfect precis to a whole series of mystery, mayhem and facination. The author strikes a perfect balance between the private lives of her characters and the blood and betrayal of their professional adventures in a nerve-tingling pace. It reminds me of Robert Ludlum at his very best. I promise it will keep you turning the pages well into the night. Read on!"},{"Title":"Freedom Underground: Love, Honor and Betray","review":"Freedom Underground is a sizzling thrill ride seamlessly melding global politics, cutting-edge technology, and the dark world of espionage into a compelling, full-blooded novel. An amazing true sounding story, a thrilling behind-the-scenes tale showing how a would-be spy is trained in the field under the stern discipline of a great spymaster while at the same time having to face the hard truths of espionage's inherent moral ambiguity, personal costs, and sacrifices as well as the remarkable courage and triumphs of those who seek to do good and are dedicated to serving world's freedom. I absolutely loved it, couldn't put it down until the end and then I was sorry it ended too soon. I hope the second volume comes out soon enough."},{"Title":"Freedom Underground: Love, Honor and Betray","review":"Great plotting, fascinating characters, amazing technical accuracy, breath-taking action, and the liaison between the main characters Alex and Alina points to the passion sadly missing from many of today's spy thrillers. But the best part of the book is the author's unrelenting examination of the moral ambiguity inherent in intelligence and counter-terrorism. Set aside a few days of your life for Freedom Underground, it's well worth it. I never regreted spending my money on it."},{"Title":"Journey to Machu Picchu: Spiritual Wisdom from the Andes","review":"Whether you travel to Peru in person or in spirit, this book will guide you. The authors share their vast knowledge of all things Andean, going far beyond Machu Picchu and other sites of Peru in much greater depth than the usual tour books. This book is very readable, very approachable, and the reader comes to know how deeply the authors love Pachamama (Mother Earth) and the people of the Andes. The book is enhanced by outstanding stories of the people and by splendid photography (color as well as black and white).Bottom line: I love this book.The book has the information of an encyclopedia without the dryness and some might say without the organization. It is like a syncopated fountain, flowing with details, dotted with definitions and poetic words of the people. Information is often repeated in different contexts so that at the end the reader has really learned something. That something is likely to be very personal to each reader. It may include a knowledge of Andean cosmology and a familiarity with the three worlds of Hanakpacha (upper world, represented by the condor), Kaypacha (present world, represented by the puma), and Ukhupacha (lower or inner world, represented by the snake). Along the journey, the reader will come to know and feel the protection of the apukuna (deities of the mountains) and to appreciate the connection we all have to Pachamama and to each other. The reader can also delve into sacred sites, healing ceremonies, daily life, the rich language, dream material, medicinal healing techniques, and so many other subjects.Like an incredible tapestry, the book weaves together the personal stories of the authors, plus the tales and traditions of many others. One of the most moving &quot;stories&quot; in the book is related by Aurelio Aguirre, telling of his experience as a guide for an Italian group, whose members may have literally saved his life. The tale keenly illustrates the interconnectedness of spiritual seekers--the learning and teaching and healing that ties us together, whether Andean or not, whether traveling in person or through books, in fact whether &quot;seeking&quot; or not.This reviewer is no expert on Peru, but I recently returned from my first trip there, during which time this book was published. I know that when (not if) I return to the Andes, this book will accompany me. While in Peru, I had the good fortune to meet Carol Cumes and some of the people whose stories fill this book. They are real, as authentic as can be.Enjoy this book and see where the journey takes you!"},{"Title":"Journey to Machu Picchu: Spiritual Wisdom from the Andes","review":"Journey to Machu Picchu is not a travel guide, but a glimpse at the magic and spirituality of the Peruvian Andes. A mixture of folk lore, the authors' personal experience, stories from living Quechuans (the direct blood line of the Inca), this book isn't for everyone. But, if you're interested in the spritual aspect of Machu Picchu or the Andes, then this is required reading."},{"Title":"Journey to Machu Picchu: Spiritual Wisdom from the Andes","review":"This is a pretty good book on the Quecha culture of Peru. However, there is not much in the book about Machu Picchu. So the title is a bit misleading. If you are looking for information about the historical and spiritual culture of Peru, this book, along with Return of the Children of Light, and Masters of the Living Energy: The Mystical world of the Q'ero of Peru, are your best bets. If you are looking for detailed information on Machu Picchu you should look at The Machu Picchu Guidebook: A Self-Guided Tour."},{"Title":"Journey to Machu Picchu: Spiritual Wisdom from the Andes","review":"VERY informative and beautifully written (though I think some cultural words were misspelled).. The background of the spiritual world in the Andes is beautifully described and very informative... I was born in the Andes and have learned A LOT from reading this book.. Too bad her tours are sooo expensive! =("},{"Title":"Journey to Machu Picchu: Spiritual Wisdom from the Andes","review":"I've always wanted to go to M.P and probably would have gone any old way. Now, I want to go on one of Carol's Magical Journeys! To me MP represented beautiful and fascinating remains of the Incan people. Now, I am also fascinated by the Quechua people who lived there prior to the Incans and to this day. It is these people that the book is really about and it reveals their belief systems, ceremonies, ways of life. Now I feel that a visit wouldn't be complete without a shamanic ceremony - a real one not the disrespectful fakes that are marketed to tourists by some non believers.Also, the book includes an interesting section about Hiram Bingham, the Yale professor credited with discovering MP. It lays out the controversy that surrounds him but also includes a letter written by one of his descendents for counterpoint. Anyone who is not only interested in MP but the indigenous residents of the surrounding areas will appreciate this book."},{"Title":"Journey to Machu Picchu: Spiritual Wisdom from the Andes","review":"Book arrived super fast and was a good price.

The book was clearly written for scholar-like readers and not really for casual reader who may not find this book an easy reading. The writing style isn't very good and text reading somewhat boringly.One of the elements I disliked the most about this book was that the author liked to used French quotes without English translation when he tries to make a reference. You have to look in the back of the book for the footnotes on exactly what was written. I found this approach to be awkward and silly which handicapped the flow of the passage - unless you read French that is. If the book is written in English, write down the English translation to the quote (or put the translation immediately below the quote), anything else is just some sort of \\"elitist\\" over kill.Otherwise, this book should interest anyone with a good background on the French Revolution but anyone else should not bother with it."},{"Title":"The crowd in the French Revolution (Oxford paperbacks)","review":"Rude throws facts at you constantly in such a way that it is extremely difficult to get a clear view of what is actually going on in the revolution. The quotes are still in French and translated in the back of the book which is just an annoyance to someone who doesn't know French. He also references to many people, places, and things to remember all of their relationships to one another. Just Pick another book to learn about the French Revolution."},{"Title":"The Little Book of Biblical Justice: A Fresh Approach to the Bible's Teaching on Justice (The Little Books of Justice and Peacebuilding Series)","review":"I have used this book for several classes to teach the far reaching concept of justice in the Bible. It shows that God's call to do justice is foundational to the Christian faith.

Next, I am someone who has a great interest in religion, politics and conflict resolution; yet, this book proved to be a big disappointment. The author spent alot of time talking about irrelevant matters. I was hoping for a summary or introduction even to what the title states (Biblical Justice) but that wasn't delivered. The Bible seemed to be mentioned by the author reluctantly and we are given miniscule bits of information on biblical justice. I'd say a couple of sentences at most in this entire book. What was the author talking about the rest of the time? I don't know either. Not only is the title deceiving, but it's as if the author was at a loss for words or even lacked knowledge on the subject. I don't recommend this book."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"I first read Animal Dreams ten or twelve years ago, and at the time put it on my \\"read again someday\\" list. I just went back to it, and found that decision to be wholly right--this is a lovely novel that bears rereading. I find that I want to quote specific sentences here to explain why Animal Dreams is so good, but there are so many that are either brilliantly insightful or wonderfully funny that I don't know how to choose. But here's one from the first page, as a father watches his daughters sleep: \\"Dr. Homer Noline holds his breath, trying to see movement there in the darkness, the way he's watched pregnant women close their eyes and listen inside themselves trying to feel life.\\" Kingsolver has a keen eye for detail and uses figurative language the way it should be used: not only to create an image but also to create a deeper resonance.Animal Dreams is a novel about so many things: the gulf of miscommunication between parents and children; love; grief; war; the environment; personal responsibility; finding one's way home. Codi Noline, the primary narrator, navigates these subjects with a startling honesty, humor and wisdom. She's also someone you'd want to have coffee with a few times a week for the rest of your life--as are many of the characters who populate Kingsolver's Grace, Arizona. A moving, powerful novel."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"After reading some of the other reviews of &quot;Animal Dreams,&quot; I feel compelled to point out that while those who are reading this book from a purely political perspective may indeed have grievances, they are missing, as they look for points on which to quibble, Kingsolver's exquisite gift for the use of language. I found it compelling reading, and while it is the biggest of cliches, I, too, could not put it down. And I read this book at work. At a major newspaper. Between phone calls. And I didn't care that I was sitting in the middle of the newsroom with tears streaming down my face. &quot;Animal Dreams&quot; is one of the two best novels I have ever read -- &quot;The Power of One&quot; by Bryce Courtenay is the other. I do agree that this is Kingsolver's best work. I've read everything else she has written and it pales in comparison. But then, once you're written something so compelling, it's hard to measure up. Even to yourself."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"The movement of this novel is more intuitive than straightforward. The town is in danger of extinction from the evil mines, yet this is a side issue. Her sister is in danger, living with revolutionaries in Nicaragua, but this is not the focus of the work. The focus is upon the growth and healing of the central character Codi, as these things go on around her. She learns to let down her defenses, believe in herself and the power of people around her, and step out of the protective shell she has built for herself into a world of laughter and tears.Kingsolver definitely has a talent for this kind of subtle writing. Codi feels very real, and it amazes me that through all of these clearly transforming events, she does not bow down to the ever-tempting Moment of Epiphany. Codi has no epiphanies; she simply slowly moves forward toward healing and growth. To me, this feels more true to life, and yet incredibly hard to write. I appreciate the smoothness and honesty of this character development.So the strength of this book is also its weakness - it's pretty forgettable, as most lives and learning are, honestly, pretty forgettable. I would not call this a powerful or profound novel, not one I fell in love with or will eagerly return to. It is a well-written, quiet little book. A good read, slightly better than escape literature, but not earth-moving. talk to me. williekrischke@hotmail.com."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"I was so mesmerized by the characters and setting woven together so beautifully by Barbara Kingsolver that I finished this 342 page book in less than one day. The setting is Arizona in the town of Grace, which is an apt name for the Native American inhabitants who seem so at ease with their heritage and surroundings.Codi Noline is a drifting 30-year old who decides to return to her home town of Grace to teach at the local high school for one year after abandoning her goal of becoming a doctor just short of completing her residency. Her soul-mate younger sister has gone to Nicaragua to help teach soil and crop management techniques. Codi misses her terribly, and they have a spirited and interesting correspondence.Codi is also somewhat estranged from her father, Doc Homer, who is the town's only physician and now suffering from Alzheimer's disease. She revives her friendship with an old high-school flame, Loyd Peregrina, who is an Apache railroad man, and one of the most sincere and philosophical characters in the book.She only plans to stay in Grace for one year and then move on, which is her way of avoiding planning for the future or making permanent attachments to people. The flashbacks, dreams, stories and legends of Animal Dreams explore Codi's relationships with herself, her father, her sister and the people of Grace in an endearing and memorable way.The finely crafted prose paints a vivid picture of this beautiful country and the serene, peaceful people of Grace. Codi's journey of self-discovery is woven into a suspenseful love story which will leave you feeling in a state of Grace."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"Hallie thought she was the luckiest person alive, while her sister Codi thought she didn't belong any where. The two sisters, both in their thirties, were raised by their eccentric and recalcitrant father, when their mother died shortly after Hallie's birth. When Hallie's adventurous spirit wills her off to Nicaragua, Codi feels more lost than ever, and decides to spend a year back in her home town of Grace, where her father and other figures from her childhood still live.Codi hadn't spoken to her father in years, and had grown accustomed to the silent barrier between them, that was marked only by a state boundary. She is not surprised to find her father unchanged and she once again resumed the struggle of trying to relate to him. A person Codi finds greatly changed is Loyd, a handsome Apache man, who in high school briefly touched her life and left behind a far deeper shadow than he knew. She is intrigued by his interest in her, but her long standing distrust and her secrets make her unwilling to fully open her heart. As old relationships develop and reawaken, Codi finds acceptance through saving the town of Grace from an environmental catastrophe.Codi struggles with confronting her past. And her memories, many of which were misconceptions that had changed her outlook on life and her self-image. The powerful imagery and intense flashbacks take you deep inside Codi's life so powerfully that at times, you feel almost uncomfortable. But you can't help relating to Codi for her imperfection and perfect display of human nature. This book is the fantastic read for almost anyone, although I think it might be aimed more towards women. The bluntness and characters pull you in right from the very beginning. This is my new favorite books!"},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"The characters in this book are easy to like - the author makes it feel as if you really know them. The descriptions of the southwestern landscape and culture are fantastic. The ideals behind the story (helping people in need, environmental ethics, finding purpose in life, the value of family, etc.) are wonderful concepts. However, the way in which the philosophy and politics are presented can sometimes seem preachy and a bit incongruous to the fictional format, if you dove into the book expecting a nice, cozy feel-good novel. But if you're looking for a realistic portrayal of actual world problems with fictional characters, Ms. Kingsolver does an excellent job of portraying it! Animal Dreams will force you to think about life and will make you feel some powerful emotions. A great reminder about how we humans should be."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"After about the first 45 pages I really became entranced by Codi's world. Although this book has a slow start, it is an absolute must read. The world of Codi Noline and her relationship with her father are amazingly explored with Kingsolver's brilliant writing. She creates vivid pictures and events that draw the reader into the story.

As Kingsolver so often does in her books, this story actually contains many interwoven threads, all bound together tightly yet so sparklingly different. There is the story of the main character moving back to Grace, Arizona and her readjustment. There's her relationship with her sister, her father, her lover, the community, her students/administration at the school where she works, etc. Her sister also provides an interesting thread as she works in Central America in an unpopular yet worthy cause. The book sheds light on relationships of the type mentioned above, while also providing insight into how the American media portrays foreign relations. And with all these interesting, thought-provoking threads, it is still a downright interesting story with absolutely beautiful wording.

Everyone is entitled to their opinion, but for those people who posted atrocious reviews of this book, the disconnect is not the fault of the book but of the tastes and sensibilities of the reviewers. I recommend this book heartily."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"The whole story is about the south west and interlocking society between the 'old' traditional ways of the spanish stich and bitch club, the slightly more modern generation of teenagers, and the very traditional and family based society of the indians that surround the small town of Grace are blended together so brilliantly in this masterpiece. I have never read any other work by Barbara Kingslover before, but this book has inspired me to read, something I thought I would never have any interest in. In order to truely appriciate this book though, you must have visited the south west at least once. The book holds a special meaning for each individual reader, instead of one generalized truth or lesson that just anyone can draw from it. That is what makes this book so special, especially to me. I have never even heard anyone talk with such meaning and truth as this book has. I hope that you decide to read it and love it as much as I have!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"I am a displaced Sonoran Desert Dweller (from Tucson) and all I have to do is read Animal Dreams and I am back home in an environment and culture that is familiar and soothing. Barbara's descriptions of other areas of Arizona, Canyon de Chelly and the ancient Indian dwellings in the White Mountains, are as if you are standing there.The characters are with depth and if you went to Arizona to those places during those times, that is what you would find. Strong women like Emelina, keeping their culture alive, and a big-city community barely aware of the on-goings in Nicaragua. It also describes the not uncommon will to survive of mining towns that no longer have the mine. (I'll wager that Grace is representative of the towns Clifton and Morenci.)Animal Dreams is always a homecoming."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"There are many kinds of love. Codi Noline, who can barely remember her girlhood in tiny Grace, Arizona, allows herself to feel one kind only. She and younger sister Hallie have been inseparable since their mother's death, three decades ago when Hallie was a newborn baby and Codi a three-year-old. But now agricultural specialist Hallie decides to drive herself to Nicaragua, to help the people there with their crops - just as Grace's only physician, &quot;Doc Homer&quot; Noline, reaches a stage of Alzheimer's at which it's obvious someone must go home and keep an eye on him.So Codi, who finished medical school but discovered during residency that she wasn't cut out to follow in her father's footsteps, leaves her job clerking in a 7-11 and her liaison with a man about whom she has no strong feelings to hold her. She takes a one-year job teaching science at the local high school, and re-connects with her girlhood best friend (who rents Codi a small house next to her own family). Codi never felt at home in Grace before, and she feels totally alien to it now. But staying aloof, maintaining the emotional distance on which she depends for her sense of safety, doesn't work in this place where people she fails to remember insist on recognizing and acknowledging her. Memories she can barely touch pique her curiosity, and so does the slow death of Grace's great treasure, its magnificent orchards. Slowly, the woman who needs no one and doesn't want that to change finds herself connecting with those around her anyway.Family. Community. The environment. The author's usual themes are all here, along with - to my surprise - one of the most touching yet realistic romantic love stories I've ever read. &quot;Animal Dreams&quot; is Kingsolver at her best!"},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"I checked a map of Arizona trying to find Grace, even though i knew it was an imaginary town. But it seemed so real that i longed to visit it. Kingsolver's style reminded me of such authors as Gabriel Garcia Marquez or Isabel Allende, who use a lot of imagery and colorful descriptions. I cried, i laughed. Beautiful book!"},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"Animal Dreams is the early work of a talented author. Kingsolver knows her way around a phrase, and foreshadows the talents she later put to much better use. But, in Animal Dreams, she lapses into a overly sentimental view of the world. Good and evil are cut from fairly obvious cloth. Women and men fall slightly into this pattern: women have more depth and compassion while the men are emotionally limited people. What I enjoyed most of all were the forays into the non-rational mind of Homer: to me these were the work of a true writer, whose talents had yet to manifest in full. I haven't read Kingsolver's other novels yet, but I will likely do so, thanks to the promise she showed in this mediocre novel."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"Animal Dreams was a good book that I could not put down once I started to read it. It is about two girls named Codi and Hallie who are sisters who live in Tuscan, Arizona. Hallie goes to Nicaragua to join a Communist regime and fight in a war. Codi then moves back to Grace, Arizona where she grew up to care for her father who has Alzheimer's, but people do not respect her there because her and her family is considered outsiders. Codi goes back to her hometown and she wants to become a biology teacher after she failed as a medical practitioner. Her mother at the beginning of the story has died and her personal life is in upheaval. Codi then lives with Emelina, a friend in Grace and she lives in the guesthouse. As she lives in the town the water supply starts to go bad and because of sulfuric acid and a club called The Stitch and Bitch starts to talk about the water and the men of Grace say something to the Environmental Protection Agency but they do not seem to concerned about the town of Grace since it is so small a town. Codi joins the Stitch and Bitch club and starts to get involved with the community as well. Hallie sadly dies in Nicaragua fighting for her communist cause and a service for her body is held and everyone in Grace attends. Toward the end of the book Grace finally accepts Codi and her family because they learn that they are related to the people of the town, which is very important to them, and Codi is still teaching biology after a whole year in the town. Overall I liked the book and I would recommend it to anyone who likes to read about different relationships in a small town."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"I enjoy Kinsolver's descriptions of Arizona but the main character, Condi, just kept on getting the in the way of the scenery. I never grew to care about her past or her tough life or her inability to fit in. She spends the entire book wining and feeling sorry for herself when much of her trouble is of her own making!"},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"The novel is unsophisticated, vulgar and unenlightening. It follows of the journey of hapless and unappreciative twenty-something where she travels back to her hometown and tries to &quot;find&quot; herself. It is hackneyed material and reading about the way the main character thinks makes you cringe at the sheer perverseness of it all."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"I had high hopes for this book after enjoying \\"The Poisonwood Bible\\" and \\"The Bean Trees\\", but unfortunately this book seemed to encapsulate the weaknesses of both those books and none of their strengths.I found the majority of the characters annoying and unlikable, particularly the main character, just as I did in \\"The Bean Trees\\". The ending was too pat and simplistic, as in \\"The Bean Trees\\", and it needed some severe editing, as did \\"The Poisonwood Bible\\".I can't emphasize enough how much I disliked the main character of this book. That, combined with the unrealistic plot, made this book a struggle for me to get through. I was counting the pages, as I did in the last third or so of the vastly superior \\"The Poisonwood Bible.\\"Maybe Kingsolver's writing skills (and decisions about major characters' personalities) will improve with more time. I know she has the potential, so I remain hopeful."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"This book was the worst piece of literature I've ever read. If it was my own property and I wouldn't have to read it for my English class, it would have entertained my garbage can instead. The author seems to have serious trouble with the world around her and a notorious passion for the overuse of metaphores. Two times I actually fell asleep while reading this book. Her characters lack personality, the whole plot seems unrealistic, but as if it tries to convince you of its reality. Especially the main character Cosima, who wants to look like a outsider but then complains about it all the time, is missing a realistic personality. If you are worried about nature, DON'T WASTE PAPER LIKE THIS."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"There is no doubt that Barbara Kingsolver is a talented writer, which i learned from reading another one of her novels, The Bean Trees. But Kingslover disappointed me with this book. After reading her other book, i expected this story to be another descriptive realistic book. What I got was the sappy story of Codi Noline's romance with an old high-school boyfriend, and the story of how she &quot;finds her past&quot; in the town where she grew up. The plot was not at all creative, and like every other romance novel. I would not even call this book &quot;literature.&quot; If you want to read a good book, i would suggest The Bean Trees, also by Barbara Kingsolver."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"The book was well written, but there was nothing extremely exciting emphasized, therefore making the book boring, making readers think something cool is coming up, but there isn't."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"I read this book for my school's Literary Club, and I thought it was pretty good. I liked the way it was written, and it was easy to read, but it was lacking in the plot department. I didn't really like that it didn't really focus on anything. It was just about this chick and her life and her search to find herself. I, unlike most girls, aren't into &quot;chick&quot; books, and I thought this was kind of like that. Overall, I'd say take it or leave it. It's well-written with almost no plot. You decide."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"This book was suggested to me for a summer reading list. I read the book. Well not really, I was so lost and extremely bored with the story that I never finished it. I had about 20 more pages to read and I couldn't do it. It may make more sense to an adult reader, but if you are under the age of 18, don't read this book, I doubt it'll make sense."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"Although it deals less with ethical and political issues than &quot;Pigs in Heaven,&quot; I found this the most reaching and characteristically interesting of Kingsolver's novels. The children's relationship with their father, Homer's view of the sisters' childhood contrasted with Hallie's and Codi's, was amazing. The idea of childhood rejection and the graceless return home was to me not only interesting, but personally involving. Flawed only by an unrealistically bright everything, resolving all of the issues too thoroughly."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"Barbara Kingsolver deserves recognition and gratitude from the world for writing such a beautiful book as Animal Dreams. The novel mixes the themes of culture, love, and death with a woman's struggle to find herself in life. Her interesting quest seems to be to achieve tranquility with the world around her. Following this woman on her journey to find her place is an exhilirating and invigorating adventure. Animal Dreams is a beautifully written book that should be read by all who are literate."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"I'VE READ ALL 3 OF KINGSOLVER'S BOOKS AND THIS IS DEFINITELY HER BEST. I HAD IT ON MY SHELF FOR ABOUT 3 YEARS ON THE RECOMMENDATION OF A FRIEND AND NEVER BOTHERED TO TAKE IT DOWN. WOW WHAT A READ. WHAT A PORTRAYAL OF FAMILY RELATIONSHIPS AND THE DELICATE PROCESS OF FALLING IN LOVE. WHAT A SAD ENDING! ALL THE WAY THROUGH SMALL MYSTERIES ARE SET UP AND THEN GRADUALLY EXPLAINED. SHE HAS A WONDERFUL STYLE AND GRACE IN HER WRITING. ALL HER BOOKS ARE ABOUT THE EXCEPTIONAL LIVES OF ORDINARY PEOPLE. READ IT NOW"},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"Ms. Kingsolver has an incredible ability to reach the inner neurosis (or not) of each character. She brings out the eloquence of a simple, happy lifestyle and the agony of someone who is struggling for more...and stuggling to wonder why. Beautifully written."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"Kingsolver's fluid and sweet writing is great for anytime that a bookworm wants to sit down and escape to a different place. I've never really been that interested in native-American subject matter, but I loved this book. Light enough for fun-reading, but good enough to be considered literature."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"...Codi sees what she is shown: a holiday celebration, and some places that are very special to one who is special to her. Of course she sees mostly the good parts of this culture. She also sees cock-fighting, and some similarities between the pueblo and Grace that surprised her. And yes, some bread really does smell like love. :) It is about a person who feels REJECTED. Yes, it's pretty unrealistic how great things turn out in the end. But don't you wish reality were that way? I read this book at least once a year, because I want to pretend that these characters really exist."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"I loved this book from the first page. Kingsolver uses every day language but somehow adds a twist of lemon into it to make it hers. This book was about a young woman, Codi who returned to her hometown in search of herself. When she reached Grace she found that she was a strong, independent woman on a mission."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"This book was like reading my autobiography. The character Codi thought and felt just like I do. Her soul was so deep and her pain was so real I thought about her journey long after I put the book down. This book is for those who like Codi went through the painfull journey of finding themselves and trying to get through the darkness that sometimes haunts are past. This book is beautiful and a book of poetry. Plus it is a great love story. A deep love story and refreshing after seeing the card board crap from Titanic!"},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"I enjoyed a lot about this book, particularly the environmental plotline, the cockfighting issue, and the portion of the story that takes place in the Indian dwellings. What I did not enjoy was the ending. I think it was lazy and predictable."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"This is truly one of the best novels I have ever read. The main character, Codi Noline, is a woman in search of her own identity. She goes back to her hometown where she always felt like a stranger. She faces her memories of the past and begins to deal with what life throws at her in a different way. I was not able to put down the book. I have reread it twice already."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"I give this beautiful little gem to all my very dear women friends. If I owned just one book - this would be it."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"This book is definitely in my &quot;favorites&quot; list. Kingsolver manages to address the issues of mundane everyday life &amp; make them magical. Her writing flows like nothing I've ever seen."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"This was a really sweet story even though it is a little contrived; it would have been more interesting if hallie had lived and loyd had died! The residents of Grace, Loyd, and Codi were just too sweet to make this a really great story and a great novel. The most interesting character in the book was Homer - his sections were wonderful. (And he also wasn't perfect). The long suffering but perfect Codi was a little much .., I agree with Hallie when she wrote to her sister , &quot;if I gt another letter that mentions SAVING THE WORLD, I am sending you, by return mail, a letter bomb. Well back at you Codi. Even though I don't agree (that she's perfect - I actually find her dislikeable).. She blames her father for her rotten attitute (the author seems to agree) when really she is kind of a spoiled brat. I guess it is beginning to sound like I didn't like the book when I really did. I like most of Kingsolver's opinions about things, but she always seems to take them one step farther than I am comfortable with -- seeming kind of above everyone else."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"You won't be able to keep yourself from crying as you read this girl's story. You may even find yourself relating with the main character."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"that says it all, really. there are moments in the narrative that simply took my breath away. everyone should read this exquisite book."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"A series of life-defining tragedies are played out in &quot;Animal Dreams&quot;: Sisters lose their mother in childhood, grow up isolated from their peers (thanks to a stiff and unattentive father), then grow apart after one (the narrator) suffers a miscarriage at 15. (As if a med school-bound girl would want a child at age 15!). Codi returns to her hometown after bailing out of med school and a dead end relationship, and intends to assist her ailing father. In Grace she confronts her father's progressive dementia, an environmental disaster,her family's secret history, and the abscence of her sister, whom she likens to God. Of course this leads to a very predictable ending, and the biggest tragedy of them all.Codi reluctantly becomes saviour of her father, her hometown's river and orchards, the high school, and berates herself for not saving Nicaragua and the Ozone layer as well. Four stars for elegant writing and an interesting location (gotta love Tucson!), which makes up for overblown sentimentality and preachy environmentalism."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"This is the first Kinsolver book I've read. Initially I was blown away by her narration- how she described things and the way she set the plot fot the events to come. She is a geat writer. That being said, just past the middle of the book, the story began to drag, and the descriptions and some of the scenes seemed superfluous to the story. I found myself saying, &quot;Just get on with it, already.&quot; Another issue I had with the story was the way things came together and fit sort of well; it seemed a bit hunky-dory for my taste, which led to me doubting the reality of the story.Overall, a decent read. And if you enjoy vivid descriptions that are many, and if you enjoy stories with fairy tale like endings, then you'll probably like this book."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"Animal Dreams is a well-written and entertaining novel. I found it difficult, however, not to be distracted by the author's Manichaean political message: the Nicaraguan communists of whom she writes were uniformly benevolent, and the U.S. and its contra allies were consistently underhanded, even murderous. Reality was a little more nuanced than that, as the Sandinistas' failure to win any open national election since the collapse of the USSR demonstrates. In short, this is a generally good book, but Kingsolver detracts from the novel through (unfortunately frequent) detours into her rather cartoonish political philosophy."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"This is my second Kingsolver book. The first one was Prodigal Summer and it was fantastic.This story is slow and not very engaging."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"I decided to give Kingslover another chance after reading The Bean Trees. Unfortunately, Animal Dreams didn't improve my opinion of the author's storytelling. Like the Bean Trees, Animal Dreams seems to be obsessed with the Great White Mother rescuing the poor little red and brown folks out there. It's great that she has a liberal heart and think about political issues that deal with non-whites out there. However, it doesn't translate so nobly anymore. It's starting to sound like Upper Middle Class white Peace Corps volunteer club. Let's have more stories about people helping themselves, rather than a bunch of Halle's rescuing the &quot;natives&quot; from powers-that-be. Also, the theme of finding the perfect &quot;minority&quot; mate in both books are getting old. Please think of a new story."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"Haunting, engaging, and magical, Animal Dreams explores many of the issues of life: love, familial relations, life ambition, memory, and life, human and animal. I had a difficult time finding part of Codi's character believable, but was very impressed with Hallie's character. This was my first introduction to Kingsolver and it made me eager to read more!"},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"At the core of this novel is the natural world that Barbara Kingsolver loves, and living in it are authentic characters complete with hope and dreams and demons. Codi is an especially full character whose needs and fears are tangible; she is haunted by the catastrophes of life and love. So is the reader, through prose that is richly detailed as Kingsolver smoothly blends flashbacks and dreams into the perceptive, wide-awake voice."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"This story is really very beautiful. It Just talksabout love, about how Codi Noline has had a voidin the sphere of love for so many years and needssome one who is caring in her lifethat will pay attention to thedetails she has to say. The story takes place inGrace Arizona. Animal Dreams reminds me of Childrenof the Desert which was written Rudolfo Anaya. Theauthor of Animal Dreams i assume knowsand speaks the languageof Spanish because this book contains alot of wordsblended in with English. One has to think in a higherlevel, that this is not some type of harlequin romancenovel, but a story that deals with love."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"Good fast read - fun book. I enjoyed The Bean Trees and Pigs in Heaven more, but this book was a close second."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"I have read this book at least 5 times. Every time I read it something new emerges that I had not seen before. It's a great story, but much more than that. Themes are woven through the book that continue to inspire awe in me for Ms. Kingsolver's craftsmanship. I put this book on the require reading list for my daughters. They don't have to read it now, just sometime (Mom's supplementary education). Those who have read it have loved it, whatever their age (16 and up)"},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"I've just finished reading all the reviews of this book- yes, all 80 of them. And I've noted a few things:1. Apparently there are tons of teachers out there putting this on their required-reading lists. It seems like a lot of kids are reading this not by choice but because they have to. Someone said that if you have any choice in the matter, you should not spend money on this book. I think it's the other way around... a person who is choosing their reading material will probably enjoy this more than someone who isn't, simply because they must have seen something redeeming in the book in the first place. I would like to know how many students started to read this book with a positive attitude and were disappointed, versus how many students were unhappy about reading it before they even opened the book.2. You really do have to know something about the Southwest (or at least be interested in the Southwest) to appreciate this book. I grew up in Arizona and the descriptions of settings in this book ring very true to me. It's not so much what the individual words themselves say... it's the mood that all the words together create (I hope that makes sense).3. Yes, this is probably a &quot;chick&quot; book. It is written from a woman's point of view. The author is a woman. It talks about &quot;feelings&quot;. Okay, so some guys do not like this... that's okay. But I truly hope the ones who consider it trash, do so not just because it's told from a female perspective.With all that said, I should say that I've read the book twice. The first time, I thought it was okay, but not up to par with &quot;Bean Trees&quot; or &quot;Pigs in Heaven&quot;. A few years later, I read it again and enjoyed it much more. It is a quieter book than most of Kingsolver's works... not as touchy-feely as &quot;Bean Trees&quot;, or as political as &quot;Pigs in Heaven&quot;, or as sweeping as &quot;Poisonwood Bible&quot;. In effect, it is probably the most balanced of her novels, and in my opinion, probably not the best book to start with if you are new to Kingsolver, but one that you should definitely try out if you decide you enjoy her work."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"A review from the author of DREAMING YOUR REAL SELF: A PERSONAL APPROACH TO DREAM INTERPRETATION; and DREAM BACK YOUR LIFE: TRANSFORMING DREAM MESSAGES INTO LIFE ACTION: A PRACTICAL GUIDE TO DREAMS, DAYDREAMS, AND FANTASIES.Kingsolver is a master storyteller. Throw in her politics, passions, and ability to describe environmental concerns without getting preachy, and you can learn something from her books. Add her lyrical prose and you have a winner. I love her work and was glad to see that in ANIMAL DREAMS, she departed only very briefly from the point of view of her protagonist. I love how this story unfolded, the development and changes of the viewpoint character, and the very positive view she gives us of relationships between men and women who love each other. A delightful book on all counts!"},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"This book is a masterpiece. Kingsolver has amazing insight into relationships, between Cosima and her sister, her father, and Loyd with one L. She creates fascinating characters, settings and stories effortlessly. I love this book."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"I did not like the beginning of the book, in fact I had to read it several times (the beginning) in order to understand it . But later on the story got so interesting I could'nt stop reading . Barbara Kingsolver definitely deserces some credit for this book ."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"Barbara Kingsolver continues to amaze me. Even though she has a lot of repition in her novels considering they are all affiliated with her own background and that can get kind of boring, she is awsome and her stories are powerful. Read all of her books becuase they are all so good."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"Kingsolver is an author who believes in more than just telling a story. She believes a story must leave the reader with expanded knowledge. A nasty spoonful of good medicine, it would seem to some readers, perhaps reading for the escapism alone... but I have no qualms with this whatsoever. Most of this author's lessons center on environmental and human rights issues. So teach me, Kingsolver, I am always willing to learn, to expand my mind in a new direction. Why should good literature not enlighten as well as entertain?\\"Animal Dreams\\" delves into both of Kingsolver's usual areas of interest. Her main character, Codi, opens the eyes of her students in her classroom to the world beyond the classroom walls. She may use unconventional methods, including allowing her own humanity to leak out, imperfect and dysfunctional adult that she is, and expects chastisement from the powers that be... but not only do her initially astounded students accept her empassioned message, but the school board, too, offers her a permanent teaching position when she thought herself there only temporarily. Indeed, the entire novel beckons this character with the allure of putting down roots, finding home, in place and in heart. Feeling herself a misfit in her hometown and within the bewildering confines of her family, Codi is not easily convinced that she is deserving of love and respect (or forgiveness) - from her estranged father, from her students, from her community, from her rediscovered high school sweetheart. Kingsolver describes the process of self-acceptance in this character with her usual rich writing style... and, of course, fits her lessons between and into the lines as neatly as always."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"I was probably too young to appreciate this novel the first time I read it. But I recently picked it up again after a pilgrimage of sorts through the astonishing beauty of the Southwest and its peoples, and found it to be, not only true to the setting, but achingly accurate in its portrayal of the protagonist's despair, struggle, and ultimate redemption. Readers who are tempted to abandon the book early on because they find Codi whiny, self-pitying, and insecure when she first returns to Grace should recognize that epiphany requires the illumination of initial darkness. Kingsolver's exquisite imagery and strong sense of social responsibility only enhance my appreciation of her unlikely heroine's journey to forgiveness, intimacy, and self-reliance."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"Kingsolver has really outdone herself this time! She has indeed created for her readers a book bursting with flashbacks, dreams, and half-remembered images that lay before you the course of the story. It is even enhanced along the way by letter-format correspondances from the main character's sister, Hallie. The main character in Animal Dreams is a young woman named Codi on a quest for her true home. Among literary fanatics, this is what is known as a \\"coming of age\\" story. She IS on a quest, although she doesn't realize it; although she actually stays put in one little town after all her years of tromping all over the country (or rather, all over the world). And throughout her quest, Codi (who narrates her own tale) pulls us along on her pyschological travels, along the rough road she follows, with all its dips and turns and steep inclines.You know you've got the work of a superior writer in your hands when you're reading and you are suddenly depressed in the midst of a depressing scene, or elated at the onset of a joyous occasion. Yes, Barbara Kingsolver is certainly a literary mastermind. Her descriptions sometimes boarder on being \\"Steinbeck-ish\\", but when you're talking about fiery Southwestern sunsets and gorgeous desert mountains, then elaboration like that gets a thumbs up from enthralled readers (readers like me, anyway).I would recommend Animal Dreams to no one under say, 13. Only because someone younger than that might not understand it (it does have a rather complicated plot), and there are a few, let's say, VERY romantic scenes. Another really great thing about Animal Dreams is that it highlights several really important morals of society: Big corporation's pollution of small-town rivers, refugee rights (i.e. Nicaraguan rebels vs. U.S. contras), Teen Pregnancy, and even high school apathy. So if you ask if there's anything more to learn from Animal Dreams than new vocabulary, yes! Kingsolver throws a bunch of social justice and relationship based struggles at you. Justice fought for in one's own mind, justice fought politically: group against group, and justice fought for the environment. Barbara Kingsolver is the kind of author that does not hesitate to promote justice of all kinds!Animal Dreams is an engaging novel. Not quite the type that'll have you on the edge of your seat, but I'll attest to the fact that it certainly does keep you reading on: eyes consuming page by page, while your mind looks to coming chapters and wonders: what could happen next?"},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"This is a book to savor. Animal Dreams was the second Kingsolver book I read -- the first being the Bean Trees -- and it was so good that I forced myself to only read one chapter per day so I could enjoy it for a greater length of time. Kingsolver is so adept at getting inside the heads of her characters that you feel you know them like family. I miss Codi and Loyd very much."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"Animal Dreams had been given to me by a friend, who had been highly touting its merits for quite some time. She said that it had changed her life, and bestowed upon it all the other superlatives that appear in most of these reviews.Now, I like this friend very much. And I, like all humans, want to believe that the people I like very much have wonderful, infallable tastes...as if this somehow reflects back on me. So I tried really hard to like this book. I just couldn't.It's not a bad book. Kingsolver's opening metaphors are strong and well conceived, her themes are well-woven and evolve nicely throughout the novel, and her writing style is heightened without being pretentious. However, her characters are broad, two-dimentional, and, for the most part, strictly utilitarian. The only character who approaches something akin to a believable human in his complexity is Doc Homer, whos ambiguous nature ends up being &quot;explained&quot; away and sentimentalized to the point of absurdity.Many reviewers here have also noted the &quot;agitprop&quot; nature of the novel, which is extremely abrasive and does not coalesce well with her gentle, almost lyrical prose. In this respect, her weakness is trying to make her themes and ideas carry the novel instead of the characters and situations. And, like her characters, these themes are almost always annoyingly oversimplified and sentimentalized (i.e. her &quot;noble savage&quot; ideas of Native American culture and her ridiculously romantic notion of the Sandinistas)Again, her writing has strengths. But, in spite of all the recommendations I received, I can't honestly say this book reached me in any significant way."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"I'm a sucker for reading other people's favorite books of all time. When someone tells me a certain book is one of the books of their life, I get this pressing urge to run out and secure a copy. It generally doesn't matter what genre or style of book it is. I think this is mostly because I know what it means to care so much about a book you have to have it nearby at all times. Maybe you own more than one copy so that if you lend one out you've still got a spare...just in case. Maybe you can't remember a time when you hadn't read and loved that book, those characters. I know what that feels like. And because I have such tender feelings for certain books, I want to have read the books others feel the same way about. It's almost always a rewarding experience. One of the most memorable of these times happened several years ago when a good friend of mine on Readerville was talking about what a superb novel Barbara Kingsolver's ANIMAL DREAMS was. I had read one Kingsolver book at that point--The Bean Trees: A Novel--and, while I appreciated parts of it, my overall reaction was pretty lackluster. So it wasn't with a lot of excitement that I approached Kingsolver's second novel.Codi Noline thought she'd left Grace, Arizona once and for all when she and her little sister Hallie escaped and went away to college. It's been ten years since then and Codi and Hallie have traveled farther than she ever expected. Even after medical school and several stints as a world traveler, she's never found a place she could call home And yet, when the call comes in that her father has Alzheimer's and can't live alone anymore and Codi returns home to look after him, she finds to her chagrin that she hasn't moved that far beyond her childhood after all. Back in Grace, she stays in her old friend Emelina's guest house and takes a job teaching biology at the local high school. With her platinum blonde hair and her checkered history with this town, she stands out like a sore thumb and she's all but sure it was a colossal mistake coming home this way. But as she exchanges letters with Hallie, deals with her deteriorating father, and strikes up a tentative friendship with Loyd Peregrina--an Apache railroad brakeman she once knew--Codi's perspective is challenged on so many levels and the lines between memory and truth and past and present are blurred so far it's all she can do to hang on to the here and now.Here are the opening lines from Codi's perspective:\\"I am the sister who didn't go to war. I can only tell you my side of the story. Hallie is the one who went south, with her pickup truck and her crop-disease books and her heart dead set on a new world.Who knows why people do what they do? I stood on a battleground once too, but it was forty years after the fighting was all over: northern France, in 1982, in a field where the farmers' plow blades kept turning up the skeletons of cows. They were the first casualties of the German occupation. In the sudden quiet after the evacuation the cows had died by the thousands in those pastures, slowly, lowing with pain from unmilked udders. But now the farmers who grew sugar beets in those fields were blessed, they said, by the bones. The soil was rich in calcium.\\"I knew right away I liked Codi. I felt sorry for her and I wanted to know her better. By the end, I liked her even more, as though I understood her because I had followed her home. Kingsolver's storytelling is breathlessly evocative. I constantly found myself gasping at the way she wields the written word to move her readers and wrap them up in a vision of the world the way it is and the way it could be. Halfway through my first read, I couldn't take it any longer. I quietly returned my library copy and fled to the bookstore to buy one of my own. I had to own this book and I wasn't even finished yet! Truthfully, ANIMAL DREAMS took me completely by surprise. It had me by the throat with its motherless sisters who want to save the world, its handmade peacock pinatas, its dying town, and its gorgeous, gorgeous longing. The story of a girl searching to belong, of a town struggling to survive, and the intricate myths and culture surrounding them all completely engulfed me. To say nothing of the quiet, intense love story winding its way through the beautiful prose. There were so many other passages I wanted to quote for you but in the end I couldn't take away that opportunity of discovering them for yourself. It's just too special to intrude on in that way. When I think of those few perfect books, this one always comes to mind. I'm so glad Zanna sang its praises so emphatically. I'm so glad I listened. Because it's one of the books of my life now, too. I like having it nearby at all times. I have a lending copy...just in case. And I have trouble remembering a time I didn't know and love Codi, Loyd, and all of Grace."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"This is what I would call a character book, as distinguished from a strongly plot-driven book. The whole point of the book is the character growth and the emotions which accompany it. The characters are imperfect and complex, characters we can relate to rather than cookie-cutter characters who exist only to act out a plot. Reading this book is an emotional experience. I laughed and I cried, sometimes at the same time. After reading some of the other reviews, I have a hunch that younger readers may not appreciate the book because they simply can't relate to experiences common later in life (death of loved ones, ailing parents, rediscovering yourself, a desire to find your roots, etc.)"},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"Simply put, &quot;Animal Dreams&quot; is one of the most poignant, piercingly beautiful stories I've ever read. Magnificent writing. This is not just a &quot;novel.&quot; It is literature.Synopses or overviews tend to give away too much of the story. Briefly, a young woman's journey into her past brings her to the present, with an eye to a hopeful future. The setting of a small southwestern town is depicted so vividly and alluringly, it will make you wish you could find it and move there. Barbara Kingsolver uses virtually every ingredient that transforms a story into a great book. A beautiful balance of joy, anger, love, despair, and hope."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"I am a late-comer to Kingsolver, despite years of friends urging me to read her. So when I began, I went backwards, from her newest to \\"Animal Dreams,\\" one of her first and most brilliant works.How can I describe the way Kingsolver writes? She has a way of putting together simple words in ways not thought of before, and the result is a kind of poetry--a lyrical, deceptively simple way of sharing deep truths--that simply is one of a kind.Most of her books are similar: Disaffected woman seeks meaning of life in the simplicity of a forest, a small town, travels through the Southwest, or whatever. This book is no different, but seems so original, so distinct. It's the story of Codi Noline, who returns to her hometown of Grace, AZ, to care for her ailing father, recently diagnosed with Alzheimers. Codi has left behind a half-hearted relationship, a go-nowhere minimum wage job (despite the fact that she has all but completed her medical degree) and a go-nowhere life.Now she returns to memories, dreamed or otherwise, that almost overwhelm her with their vividness. Deeply missing her cherished sister Hallie, Codi tries to find some sort of center--all the time desperately wanting to run away. The ending, like all of Kingsolver's books, is so true, so satisfying, so real that the reader just has to weep.Along the way are Kingsolver's deeply held views on the environment, the sanctity of the earth, the beauty of the Native American culture--all woven into the story but never subtle. It's part of who she is, and she is indeed one of a kind. A gem."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"&quot;Animal Dreams&quot; is one of those books people either love, or just don't get what all the hoopla is about. After the first 50 pages, I found I couldn't put the book away. Barbara Kingsolver writes in such a manner that you forget you are reading text. Her colorful discriptions of the Southwestern landscape and people engulfed all my senses. The characters were very realistic to me, because I know those same people, only by different names. There may be character development flaws and storyline weaknesses, but I am not a literary critic. I read for pleasure, and for me, this book contained many miles of enjoyment. If you want to read a book that will skillfully transport you from where you are, &quot;Animal Dreams&quot; has that magic. I wouldn't recommend this book to everyone, because you have to have a certain kind of vision to see how beautiful the desert and it's people are. If you don't already have a sensability of wonder and affection for the region, then you're probably one of those people who just don't, and won't, ever get it."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"An emotional masterpiece...A novel which combines every human emotion with masterful prose. It will seize you by the heart and soul...and it's beautiful scenes and imagry won't soon leave you. It was Kingsolver's ability to capture human emotions and experiences in such a new and delightful way that won me over. She has a wisdom when it comes to expression of all things human that seems rare. Her writing is one of a kind, and will delight anyone who reads it. Whether it is her novels, short stories, or essays, anything by Kingsolver is worth reading. I highly recommend this book, especially to those who are a a point in their lives where they are trying to find themselves. I first read this book as I was just starting college...I could relate to the characters and themes in this book in so many ways...because I was at a point in my life when I was trying to find my place in the world as well. Following Codi on her journey to find herself in the most unlikely place will fill you with wisdom and touch your heart. A must read!!"},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"OK, so a friend of mine had to read &quot;The Bean Trees&quot; for school a few years ago. I picked it up out of boredom and started reading. She took it back that night and I couldn't finish. So last November I finally got a copy and I read it in a few hours! I bought &quot;Pigs In Heaven&quot; and loved that, too. But last week I checked &quot;Animal Dreams&quot; out at the library and I fell in love with this book! Kingsolver's style is warm and sympathetic yet honest to her characters. And Codi...here is a character that is me in so many ways. Of course, we are only similar in my own head, but this story has hit me in such a way that I think I might have to go write a song about Loyd's quote about carrying your life with you....GREAT BOOK!"},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"There are times when it seems that Kingsolver's tales are simply the bait that she uses to trap readers into listening to her stump speeches on minorities, the environment, family values or the plight of the third world. Still, since she is a very picturesque writer, I am willing to forgive her. Animal Dreams follows a year in the life of Codi Noline, a disenchanted young woman trying to find her place in life, and finding it in the last place she expects. Certainly, it is not the most original theme, but Kingsolver executes it well, with a vivid blend of dreams and emotional storytelling. My favorite character in the book was Homer, Codi's withdrawn, emotionally repressed father whose mind deteriorates from Altzheimer's Disease through the course of the novel. I would venture to guess that women would be more likely to enjoy this book, but I, for one, thought it was pretty good."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"Barbara Kingsolver gets to the essence of human relationships. Codi and Hallie are fictional sisters, but Kingsolver's portrayal of them, their remarkable bond and their very different perspectives of the world, is vivid and feels completely real. I have read this book twice, and will enjoy it again and again."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"like many other kingsolver books this too is a great read. i definitely recommend this book anyone if you havent read any of this authors book give it a try"},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"this was the first of b. kingsolver that i ever read...long ago. was so pleased to find an author who spoke to me on so many levels, who cares about the things i care about and who writes of the southwest that i know and is in my heart. she moves from the petty detail to the breathtakingly large, weaving a wonderful, meaningful story that flows easily. i have read this novel many times over, and continue to give it as gifts to people i care about, to show them what is important to me. she has gone on to larger expressions, but this one is IT in a precious nutshell."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"As always, this is another fantastic book from Barbara Kingsolver that combines her ability to capture human relationships and emotions but with a fantastic environmental undertone. I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants a great book to read."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"Codi returns home to small town Grace to look after her distant father who suffers from Alzheimer's. She has felt like an outsider in the town her whole life which is filled with decedents of its Spanish immigrants. She feels disconnected and foreign, which has resulted in having no roots, wondering aimlessly with her sister Hallie and boyfriend Carl. As Hallie goes off to campaign for the mistreated people and farms of Nicaragua, Codi decides to go home. Yet as she reconnects with her best friend and short-term boyfriend from high school, and helps fight the mining company which is destroying the water source of the town, Codi begins to uncover some family mysteries and finds that she is not so foreign as she first thought.The novel is narratively profound; exploring memory and dreams - which means lots of flashbacks, and switching between points of views. Loyd, her past and present boyfriend, becomes symbolic for nature, and helps her reconnect to nature, which allows her to sink her roots deeply - something she has never been able to do.The novel is emotive, and heartbreaking at times. Yet also a great source of hope and a message of human rights and the environment."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"I found this book emotionally haunting, filled with the main character's yearning for what might have been. Kingsolver does a brilliant job of conveying the love, regrets, dreams, and hopes of the characters, and of tying this to political struggles of the oppressed."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"This book depicts very complex characters. The revelations about the past as the story moves along are truly surprising and continually make you re-evaluate what you think of those characters and their relationships. The southwest setting is portrayed beautifully and even meaningfully. Less humor than _The Bean Trees_, but quite compelling. I wish I could give it 4 1/2 stars."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"The novel is unsophisticated, vulgar and unenlightening. It follows of the journey of hapless and unappreciative twenty-something where she travels back to her hometown and tries to &quot;find&quot; herself. It is hackneyed material and reading about the way the main character thinks makes you cringe at the sheer perverseness of it all."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"I used to post on all books by Kingsolver. Now I am trying to stick to the Bean Trees. The Poison Wood Bible got me kicked off for a couple of months. I hope that this gets posted, because I really need some lovin right now. It has been days since my friends or I have had anything posted."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"Animal dreams is an incredible book. Kingsolver has an uncanny ability to take the most bizarre plots and make them believable. This is a book that made me want to go to Tucson, and it made me want to explore my Native American background. All I can say is the emotion is amazing."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"Animal Dreams was a wonderful story of the life of Codi and her experiences in life that led her to love in the end. She explores her childhood in this book with an unintended fear at first, but slowly moves into feeling comfortable with her life, her past, and her future. It was a wonderful book, one that I related to in many ways. :-)"},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"Barbara Kingsolver has given us a novel that opens ones mind in an unending way. She has shown her true knowledge of the southwest and used it to tell the story of Codi, a dependent person, afraid of love, yet needy of it all the same. This novel is about a lost soul searching for approval from others, ultimately finding the road to accepting oneself."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"What this book lacks in plot velocity it more than makes up for in character development and setting. The places and people feel very real. The environmental aspect is well-woven into the story, but the seriousness of the problem was solved in a somewhat light-handed fashion. Chris Beatty - Editor and Art Dirtector, Ecopress"},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"Animal Dreams is a good read, with easy, flowing language and nice character buildups. The inclusion of large problems such as the conflict in Nicaragua and the environmental problems of Grace gave the book more power than any mere romance novel. However, in my opinion, Kingsolver develops her characters more by telling us about them than by actually showing us their actions, and thus they sometimes seem contrived and one-dimensional. I believe that the book lost much of its potential because of this lack."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"Clearly one of the best books I've ever read"},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"I checked a map of Arizona trying to find Grace, even though i knew it was an imaginary town. But it seemed so real that i longed to visit it. Kingsolver's style reminded me of such authors as Gabriel Garcia Marquez or Isabel Allende, who use a lot of imagery and colorful descriptions.I cried, i laughed. Beautiful book!"},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"Barbara Kingsolver's characters are so real, after you've read one of her books, months later you may be confused as to whether the person you remember is someone you met, or someone you read about. In this instance, Cody, the main character, has real life problems and baggage from the past that she must deal with before she can let herself live in the present. Her relationship with her sister is the kind of relationship we all wish we had, and the Pueblo man that comes back into her life is the kind of man we all wish we could meet. Uplifting and evocative, and with a very respectful and insightful treatment of other cultures. Her relationship with her father is one that we may all recognize, and I think it help me put my relationship with my father in perspective. Thanks for another emotion-gripping read, Barbara"},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"Codi's sister is in Nicaragua fighting for justice. Codi returns to the mining town in Arizona where she grew up and find herself fighting demons from her past and present. A beautiful book that probes the psyche of a complex woman. A story of love, politics, ethics, environmental issues and committment.Read it and weep."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"I picked this book up at a used bookstore; I'd recently moved to the southwest, and I'd enjoyed reading \\"The Poisonwood Bible\\" in a high school English class, so I figured this would entertain me. Unfortunately, this book fell completely flat. The book doesn't ever focus on one main idea or theme, and instead it bounces around between teenage pregnancy, Alzheimer's disease, relationships with exes, the importance of heritage and a sense of belonging, corporate exploitation and corruption, and the struggles of poor farmers in Nicaragua during the Iran-Contra affair. This is, in my opinion, way too much to try and cram into the span of &lt;300 pages. I was very frustrated by all of this unfocused energy, and as a result the book as a whole was difficult to finish because I had to force myself to pay attention. I don't feel that the characters in this novel grew or changed much.In addition to trying to tackle too much subject matter, the narrators are not compelling. If you're looking for a book that incorporates the thoughts of multiple characters with dexterity and lucidity, check out \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\" by Virginia Woolf, or Faulkner's \\"As I Lay Dying.\\" In novels such as these, one major purpose of using multiple narrators is to create well-rounded characters because you see them as they see themselves, as well as how they are seen by others. This book failed to pull that off, burdened by a trite love story and Codi's lack of growth.TL;DR - This book takes on too many issues, handles none of them well, and both the characters and the story are not compelling."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"Barbara Kingsolver has written an engrossing story about the families in a small town and how they are affected by the town's history."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"Kingsolver is an excellent writer whose story about the butterflies involves both a vivid imagination, and a literary genius. It is an excellent read because Kingsolver knows how to combine both reality and fiction into a great read."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"She has Arizona down, the way it looks and feels and smells.She has the summer monsoons, the creosote bushes simmering in the desert heat.She has the strange twists of southwest cultural stew that the collision of hispanics, native americans and fifth generation anglo settlers cook up.And she has tense inner conflict between the power of the healer and self doubt of human frailty that haunts most physicans.I know this because, if I am not mistaken, I was in medical school at the University of Arizona about the time that Barbara Kingsolver was in grad school there. I grew up playing in those desertscapes, I swung little league bats at birthday pinatas. I helped my mother cooridinate relief efforts for Central American refugees in our church.I love my life in the Pacific Northwest, but reading this book gave me the first taste of deep longing for home that I have felt in years.Thank you, Ms. Kingsolver."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"This is my first Barbara Kingsolver book. I have owned it for quite some time, but I never really got around to reading it. Published in 1990, I know it's old news for most, but I was excited to see what it is about Kingsolver that enchants so many readers.We follow Codi, short for Cosima, as she moves back home to small town Grace, AZ. Her sister has traveled to Nicaragua to educate the people on growing crops. Back in Grace, Codi finds her ailing father and lots of memories. As she begins her new career as a teacher, she reconnects with old friends and makes new friends.I felt this whole book was very blah. I had a hard time connecting with any of the characters, especially Codi. To me, she seemed very whiny about her situation in life. I think I would have liked it more if it was told from third person, like Doc Homero's chapters were, so I didn't have to hear all of her self pity.Also, the \\"hero\\" of the story, Loyd, fights cocks, which is legal in Arizona, but I couldn't really get past it. His gentle handling of the bird during the fight is described in detail in this weird, loving way. Codi then condemns the whole thing, and he quits. It's all very abrupt and strange, and I don't think it added anything to the book.The one saving grace to this book was that I now want to visit Arizona. Kingsolver does have a way of making the desert sound like an alluring place, and for that I guess this gets two stars. Would I recommend it? No, probably not. Would I recommend people not read it? No, probably not. I think there's something in here for the right person. Maybe people from Arizona or who are more familiar with the Nicaraguan/American government dynamics would enjoy this story more than I did. Or, people who like romances in the guise of an overarching important theme such as self discovery or dying rivers."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"This book was captivating. Kingsolver has a rare gift of painting emotion with every word. She does not spend pages writing detailed descriptions of a character's face; she spends a novel intertwining characters personalities. You can feel the passion, the heavy sadness; you can see the world in which this story lives. She wrote so beautifully of Native American life, modern city life, loss in many ways (loss of body, mind, feeling, family) but also of gaining all those things back in a true-to-life format.I could not put this book down. It is the story of Cosima [Codi] returning to her small, environmentally-threatened town of Grace, Arizona. Where she must deal with her distant father's worsening Alzheimer's, seeing the high-school sweetheart whose baby she miscarried without his knowledge and confront the rush of long-lost memories of childhood that consume her. It is the story of loss, of re-discovering a place she thought was lost to her, family secrets coming to light..The story is also told through the eyes of Cosima's ailing father, Homero. His sections are brief but poetic, beautifully pained, delicate and encompassing."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"My daughter needed this book for her high school class.

My first exposure to Kingsolver; I want to read more by her."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"The astounding thing about this book is not that people like it. Of course people like it; it's a cheap romance with southwestern flair, and since its attention to minorities and inclusion of liberal political propaganda allow it to veil itself (albeit thinly) in a faux-pine veneer of literary merit, even those who normally suppress their appetite for cheap romance can read it and consider that they are reading something more meaningful than a LaVerle Spencer novel, or a Regency Romance. They are not. I'm not knocking genre fiction; I think it has its place and if I'm looking for brainless escape, I occasionally turn to it: it hurts my eyes less than television. I do think though that we should be aware of what we're reading. The astounding thing about this book is that readers are inclined to describe Kingsolver's prose as beautiful. Oh, my. My friends, what on earth have they been feeding you by way of books that in comparison Animal Dreams is BEAUTIFUL?Go to the library. Check out Proust, check out Nabokov. Look up Virginia Woolf, James Joyce, Thomas Pynchon. Dozens and dozens of others. &quot;No,&quot; you say, &quot;too dry, too subtle: I must have color, perverse metaphor, earthiness. I like Kingsolver's style . . . it simply shimmers upon the page.&quot; Go to the South American section. Check out a good translation of Garc&iacute;a Marquez, even Allende, who pales in comparison but could teach Kingsolver volumes. Spend some time with these authors, and then come back, and post a new review on Amazon.com. I suspect that we will see those four proud stars begin to wane. The average will plummet. We will hit 1 star by December.I see that I am not the only one who has been assigned to read this book for a class. But perhaps I am the only one who has read it for a graduate class, at a reputable university? The fact that themes treated meaningfully by authors in the past are included within these covers does not mean that it should be held in an esteem similar to the esteem in which we hold our literary giants! So-called important themes such as love, race, and belonging are equally treated in the books that line that grocery store aisle, the one that also displays hot rod magazines. If a class were about pulp fiction, I would be happy to read this novel, and write about it at length. I think that even soap operas are valid fodder for academic study, but not if we are expected to believe that they are as artistically important as a Shakespeare play, or for that matter a good independent film. However, I have no idea what element of this novel I can analyze credibly in a scholarly paper, other than the tendency of the reading public to glorify it.I did give it one star, though. Because Loyd sounds pretty hot. I think he could do much better than a woman who wears purple cowboy boots, even in the 80's. Please note, I am female: I am not rejecting this novel on sexist grounds, as prior reviewers have been accused of doing."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"After a few people told me how much they loved this novel (&quot;Their favorite book&quot;, etc.) I gave it a try. There's not much to it. It is not particularly challenging, stimulating or enlightening. It's not that wonderful as a bland romance either. I just don't see it."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"for all those who have written reviews that this book is excellent and wonderfully written, i doubt this work can even deserved to be mentioned as actual literature. i think everyone should compare this non-entity with actual real works of literary merit, such as ellison's invisible man and fitzgerald's the great gatsby.the problems with this book start immeditaely from the disjointed plotline. having both codi and her father present the story makes things irretrievably complicated, and definitely not the &quot;finely woven&quot; text i'm sure kingsolver was looking for. also, the problems that codi seems to have seem rather trivial; indeed, one gets the feeling that they are largely made up or exaggerated by herself to draw pity from the outside world. all of her problems seem the same, so hardly any development of the plot can be said to take place for 4/5 of the book. codi spends 300 pages emotionally flailing her arms, looking for help when she cant bring herself to realize that emotional healing must start with HER first and foremost..her realization of how she can create a better life for herself is the most unrealistic part of this book. in the space of one paragraph on one page, it suddenly occurs to her how she can fix her life. all at once, the problems go away and she sees everything in a bright new light.. please.. the only thing worse than asking readers to buy into codi's problems is asking us to believe that such a resolution could happen so rapidly. it almost seems as if kingsolver ran out of problems to give codi, and had to end everything quickly to achieve a happy ending so people are not bored with the text. the only problem is, the text is flat-out boring and uninstructive from the beginning. it does not teach readers any life lessons, (other than a lesson about whining when faced with ordeals) nor does it give readers hope.literary standards are indeed poor if kingsolver is considered one of the best writing talents out there today. whatever happened to real writers and real accomplishments? perhaps they have been diluted by the modern world and the need to &quot;write commercially&quot;, which after all, is what kingsolver does - she writes her books so they sell.. a literary message is secondary."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"I was forced to read this book for a college english class I took. It was pure torture. Kingsolver describes everything in such a tedious fashion, it makes you want to find the nearest blunt object and bludgeon yourself to death with it. If you are on your own free will, do not buy this book. If you do...may god have mercy on your soul."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"I know many people who LOVE Kingsolver, so I decided to take a chance. I hated Animal Dreams, but I thought it would be unfair to judge the author on the basis of one novel, so I read Bean Trees too. My opinion didn't change. I usually read classics or avant-garde literature, and Kingsolver just pales in comparison. She writes faux-important stories for people who want to feel like they've done something magnificent just by reading. Expect a lot more white people trying to take Polaroids at pow-wows thanks to Kingsolver."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"... perhaps I would have appreciated this work. I simply did not. After a great deal of reflection, I conclude that this book is pure pulp trash."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"I had to read this book for my 10th grade English class. I'm sure you all know how there are chick flicks(movies directed towards women). Well this is a chick book.

The bottom line is : it's not worth it."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"In a nutshell, there is no way to adequately articulate my disdain for this book through words. To attempt to do so would be akin to channeling a tidal wave through a plastic straw.While the premise of the plot was somewhat promising, everything overall it was just a waste of time. This book is suitable only for happy-ending junkies who need a quick fix without any sort of a meaningful resolution."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"Of all the literature I have ever read in my life, nothing has ever inflicted more pain. I was constantly overwhelmed by an urge to impale the book against the nearest object that would suffice for the task. At one point, my desperation became so acute that I actually attempted to eat the text in an attempt to end the suffering. The book is nothing more than trite melodrama. Its theme -going back to your roots, rediscovering your identity and finding your true place within the world- is likewise trite, as well as pretentious. Kinksolver seems to have an obsessive compulsive tendency towards excessive metaphor usage. Belongs in the nearest trash heap along with all the other mediocre literature ever written."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"Unsophisticated, trite, and maudlin. Not a real romance and not a real enlighening read. The story line"},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"I stumbled upon this book in 1991 when the cover art caught my eye. I had finished it by the afternoon, and by the evening, I was back at it with a pencil. The magical way that Kingsolver weaves language had me marking passages in the text and furiously copying quotes into the margins of my dayplanner. I was a college sophomore at the time, and Codi's sometimes brilliant, often hapless search to find her place in the world was familiar and affirming. I quickly bought Animal Dreams for six or seven women friends and family and each of them, whether they read it that day, or years later, raced to their phones or desks when they finished to thank me for selecting a novel that spoke so personally to them. Twenty-something women seem to especially identify with Codi's journey. While her story, and those of Loyd, Hallie, Doc Homer and the others will stay with you, the novel's impact really comes from it's powerful prose. You'll reread the same passages over and over, savoring the remarkable way Kingsolver constructs the simplest sentance. This book still feels like my personal anthem to that time in my life; thanks to Barbara Kingsolver for giving me such enjoyment and insight. If you like this book, be sure to get a copy of High Tide in Tucson, her essay collection. Don't let the &quot;essay&quot; part deter you. I have copied and circulated the title piece to women friends and family ages 16 to 89 and always it always elicits the same marvelled response. It's breathtaking."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"Animal Dreams is a rich tapestry woven of many threads: mystery, love, politics, environment, benelovance, history, culture, and the finding of oneself.

She is conflicted with who she is and where she is going; she repeatedly reminds her new lover she is not going to stay yet has no idea why. While Codi searches for something to look for, she unearths a town with many secrets and many stories. Like Codi, the reader learns about the powers of culture and history; of politics and environmentalism; and of family and love. Kingsolver's ability to catch colors, emotions, and life makes for a very engaging, beautifully-written book."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"This is Kingsolver's second novel and its as good as Bean Trees. Also set in the southwest (this time Grace, Arizona), Animal Dreams revolves around Codi Noline who returns to her hometown to care for her father, who is suffering from Alzheimer's disease. She is content with being alone because throughout her life she has consistently felt let down- first by the lack of attention by her father, by her failure to become a doctor, and lastly her pathetic personal life. Returning home though brings back her past which she has blocked many memories of, and the resurgence of an ex lover who wants to make amends by loving her right. While at home, Codi faces a lot of unanswered questions including the death of her mother, the disappearance of her sister, and the reasons behind her father's disguising (or simply ignoring the truths). Her father, a once non-emotional, inflexible family doctor must also try and remain the composure he has always held, yet his thoughts and mind race and spill out opening secrets that Codi has always wanted to find out.What makes this book exceptional is that Kingsolver writes honestly, and doesnt have flowery descriptions or paints her characters as immoral or saintly. They are vulnerable, likeable, and faulty. She builds her characters to become stronger, and considers miscommunication a cancer which if not taken care of will spread and cause trouble for years. Kingsolver also has a way of writing about the southwest that makes it come alive. Codi's heritage is American Indian as well as her lover's, and we learn more about their teachings, practices, traditions, and spiritual beliefs. Kingsolver paints a good description of the importance the American Indian way of life.If this book appeals to you, then Bean Trees may also be a good choice for your second novel. Kingsolver will not disappoint you, she is an excellent and realistic writer."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"After having my community college students read the book for several semesters, I thought I'd see what others readers say about it. The moving, personal praise the book receives - some of which is evidenced on this page - is what inclined faculty to use the book in the first place, but my classroom experience has been less laudatory.Basically, the best it has ever done is acceptance. I have never seen one student sparked by the book, in the same way that many reviewers here have been. I have seen a number of students loathe the book as overwritten (the dream sequences and plot elements used to motivate characters), preachy, and questionable - many have expressed doubts about the veracity of most all of the characters, but particularly Doc Homer and Codi. They just don't see much in these two as believable or interesting or appealing.Myself, I feel that the book is well enough written, different enough, and substantial enough to warrant the time needed to read it. It's even enjoyable in a few places, on a first read. However the book hasn't had much resonance for me in subsequent rereadings. I plan to drop it from my syllabus."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"I teach Animal Dreams every year to 11th grade English students. The most amazing thing about the book is the amount of emotional power that the characters communicate to the reader. I literally feel like I've been punched in the stomach somewhere in almost every chapter. Kingsolver conveys these emotions to me, but more exciting is that my 16 and 17 year old students feel the same way. She is able to provoke these feelings in an avid reader and in inexperienced readers as well. Kingsolver presents an idea or situation in an almost casual way and then when it returns it is packed with so much spiritual and emotional import that it literally makes you feel that the wind is knocked out of you. Without telling details and spoiling the book I will just say that Animal Dreams is the best novel that I have come across for teaching students about finding their life's purpose, mending past pain, and the importance of a sense of home and community. I love it!"},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"&quot;Animals dream about the things they do in the daytime, just like people do. If you want sweet dreams, you've got to live a sweet life.&quot; So says Loyd Peregrina, a handsome Apache in &quot;Animal Dreams&quot;. But when Codi Noline returns to her hometown, Loyd's advice is painfully out of her reach. Dreamless and at the end of her rope, Codi comes back to Grace, Arizona to confront her past and face her ailing, distant father. What she finds is a town threatened by a silent environmental catastrophe, some startling clues to her own identity, and a man whose view of the world could change the course of her life.&quot;Animal Dreams,&quot; by Barbara Kingsolver, is a dense and vivid novel, which grasps the enduring question of 'what it means to be alive'. &quot;Animal Dreams&quot; captures the beauty of life. Kingsolver use of flashback allows readers to relate their life experiences to those of the characters and in return learn some more about themselves. When Codi finally learns that the flashback she had about her mother's death was real it helped her to better understand her fathers devotion to her and their relationship. Readers realize that things are not always as they seem the first time around, and that when people are cold and distant they may only be showing they care. Because Kingsolver's characters are very realistic the story comes to life and makes it easier for the readers to relate. The descriptions and details in the book make &quot;Animal Dreams&quot; very authentic. Animal Dreams is an inspirational, sweet, and enduring book. If you enjoy books with a deep meaning, grasping you by the soul, this is for you!"},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"I have also read &quot;The Bean Trees&quot; and &quot;Pigs in Heaven&quot;, so this writer was one that I looked forward to reading again. I was not disappointed. Her insight into the relationships of parent and child, siblings - and the way that those experiences affect our personal love relationships is extraordinary. Her descriptive idiom is fresh and invigorating. I regularly found myself near to tears, particularly when Hallie went missing, and in understanding how her father was unable to express his true love for his daughters who grew up feeling like outsiders.The plot is not an action adventure, but a journey inwardly, which takes Codi from feeling cast adrift, to a safe mooring in a port which is her emotional home - a fact that the reader recognises way before Codi does.A very true and well crafted novel - and I will certainly be looking for anything else written by the author. Thank you."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"Like all of Ms. Kingsolver's books, Animal Dreams is so well written that you are accutely aware of the author's genius as you read. The characters are so well developed you can \\"feel\\" and \\"see\\" them. Intricate storylines are delicately and seamlessly woven together with beautiful prose, creating a \\"big picture\\" that is cohesive and thoroughly believeable. Without giving too much of the storyline away, Ms. Kingsolver's ability to subtly incorporate several social and political issues into her story - family relationships, Contras in Nicaragua, American Indians, ecology and corporate responsibility, to name a few - makes this book multidimensional. In my opinion, this is not Ms. Kingsolver's best book ... but she was well on her way to perfecting her incredible writing and storytelling skills while writing this book. It is an excellent, thought-provoking read."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"Animal Dreams is a vivid book that takes you through the life of Cosima while it makes you think of your own. It is touching and inspiring, reflecting on the different sociological (like the Indian reservations and lands) and ecological issues (like the river and the dam) it addresses. Although I found this book a little bit tough to read because of its rich and complex language, I found Kingsolver's words uniquely descriptive and full of emotion. You will be kept at the edge of your seat wondering what will happen next, in her love life, in her professional life, with her family... I definitely recommend this book. If you find it confusing and boring at the beginning, you are not alone, the book bounces from love to science to land. Have it a little patience and it will take your mind to places it has never been before and your heart to emotions it has never felt before."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"As a devout Kingsolver fan, I have only good things to say about this book. Some people complain that it starts off slow, has no plot, is a &quot;chick book&quot;, and is just a waste of their precious time, but I will now undo all those remarks. We jump right into the story and are wonderfully introduced to the characters as if they are real acquaintances and future friends. It is the perfect combination of introduction and fast-paced story telling. The plot is a well thought out and magically woven, but is besides the point. Even if it did have a horrendous plot, it is written so beutifully, and has such intriguing characters that it would be irrelevant. But it just so happens that the plot is captivating and quick-paced. Hehehe...a &quot;chick book&quot; well, it is clearly written from a womens perspective, and i have found that &quot;chicks&quot; tend to like it more than guys, but if guys were more patient and compassionate, they would love it as much as women. If guys don't like this book, it is by no fault of the book. Lastly, I can't think of anything better to do with your time than read this book."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"It's said that you can't go home again, but this novel is about what happens when you do. Kingsolver's flowing narrative winds like a river through the lives of the citizens of Grace, Arizona, as seen through the eyes of the prodigal daughter, Codi Noline. At a crossroads in her life, circumstances have brought Codi back to the town of her birth, a place where she and her sister had always felt like outsiders. As she becomes reacquainted with her past, she begins to understand the person that she has always been. This is one of the best books I've read in a very long time."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"Sometimes it can be hard to find yourself. Even as an adult, there are so many people wandering around out there, not knowing exactly where they are going. And the biggest message we can get from that is that it's ok. Everybody has a different path, and that's kind of what this book was all about to me.Codi Noline returns to her hometown to teach biology for a year. It's not a planned move, Codi's never been really good at planning or staying in one spot. This is just another step on the road as she meanders around trying to find some bit of happiness. In fact, her father's decline from Alzheimer's is all that brings her back anyway. Meanwhile, her sister Hallie is off to South America, to try to teach farmers a way of saving their crops and lands, but finds herself in some dangerous work because of the political climate there. Codi does reconnect with several people from her childhood though, most notably a man that she had conceived a child with when she was in her teens, although he doesn't know about it. And as she starts to settle in her old urge to pick up and go reemerges, and she just can't figure out what she should do with her life.Codi is a compelling character. You can feel sorry for her, and empathize with her, because she is so real. Kingsolver is a character builder, and that's what all her books are about, the people. Codi is no exception, she has some real problems in her life and with her feelings and I can really relate to her. Especially about the not knowing what to do with your life. Hey boyfriend Loyd (and yes it is spelled that way) is also a pretty decent guy. He has some hobbies that I'm not thrilled with but allows himself to grow and tries to be a good person. So that's admirable in my eyes. All the other characters are pretty wonderful too. They're all so real and definitely can remind you of people in your own life. It was like watching someone's life go by, in a book.I could see where this book could be potentially boring for some. Not a lot really happens, it's mostly the main characters musings and conversations between everyone. But I found it easy to immerse myself in the book and get lost. I kind of feel like a broken record saying it, but everything just felt so real. Like I could go out West and find this group of people. The main point of views switch between Codi and her father, and I found that a little distracting, but it did help with some background information in regards to Codi. But then because her father is suffering from a mental disease it also made it hard to understand from his point of view. Which is clever writing but still frustrating at times.A very good book and one I'd recommend. I wouldn't say it was a favorite but I found it very compelling. I look forward to reading more by Kingsolver.Animal DreamsCopyright 1990352 pagesReview by M. Reynard 2012"},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"When Codi Noline has to return to her hometown, to care for her father, it becomes an unexpected time of awakening. A number of subplots are beautiful thread throughout the story, including rekindled love, politics, the rich cultural history of the southwest, and how one might discover oneself in the most unexpected times and places. Kingsolver's ability to capture the essence of a land and its people continues to amaze me. I would rate it right up there with The Poisonwood Bible. Another beautifully written book."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"While this novel did not resonate with me quite as much as The Poisonwood Bible did, the prose was beautiful, and I definitely identified with Codi, the main character. This story was strikingly human and the ending literally brought tears to my eyes--I would certainly recommend it to any and everyone!"},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"I was given this book by a friend at work and she insisted that I read it. Once I started the book I just couldn't put it down. I found Codi's story to be compelling and as the layers unfolded I couldn't help but cry as I realized what this girl must have went through. This book shows the steps Codi goes through to realize that she has been loved all along and it just took opening herself up to figure that out. This was one of the best books I have read in awhile and I highly recommend it and I cant wait to read more books by this author!"},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"If you were never really there in the first place.This book works on a lot of levels, from such exquisite details as the difference between two peacock feathers, to light and refreshingly unsmutty romance, to a classic earth parable, to the eternal truths that most of us get to know our parents too late and that we are who we are, not who others want us to be or tell us we are.If you've lost someone close, this book hits hard. For all Codi Noline's attempts to dissociate from others, her pain is there for us to share. The very fact that Kingsolver doesn't let Codi acknowledge, let alone wallow in, her pain is precisely what makes it so available to the reader.The action is minimal. Nothing blows up. But one thing leads logically to another, and there is plenty of character-driven drama and suspense. The only thing I'd change about the book is that it gets a little preachy here and there. But only a little. And Kingsolver is right."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"Animal Dreams was a phenomenal read! I personally enjoyed the intricately woven plot, and variety of unique characters. The essence of the novel is the narrator, Codi Noline's, struggle to find identity. The characters that fill this book drift in and out of the chapters, but each leaves a meaningful impression. Grace, Arizona, is Codi's home town. Grace is diverse in terms of people, genetics, and history; it's as if the town has a personality of its own. Codi abandons Grace after high school and then returns at the start of the novel, to aid her ailing father Doc Homer. Animal Dreams is highly recommended for those who enjoy empathizing with a rather confused narrator. It is a story of \`returning to the nest' to find the necessary roots to hold one's self down.Codi Noline's character is a lost young woman. While she encounters obstacles she gradually discovers who she is and what makes her authentic self. She realizes when separating from Grace that she leaves behind a great part of who she is. Hallie Noline is Codi's close sister who is the only person Codi lets in and trusts. Hallie moves to Nicaragua, a country in dire need of help. Codi and Hallie's father, Doc Homer, hasn't been the same since his wife's death; after Hallie was born. He has a tremendous love for the girls, but does not have the capacity to show it. Another important man in Codi's life is Lloyd Peregina. Lloyd was Codi's high school flame that re-enters her life, triggering both fond and eerie memories. The novel, Animal Dreams, is filled with passion and suspense. I highly recommend this beautiful story of an individual's life from the stages of childhood memories through adulthood discovery."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"For me, beyond all the other drama that takes place to keep the plot interesting, Kingsolver's beautifully told underlying story of a girl and her sister touched my heart. Everytime I came to another of her memories of her overprotective, somewhat overbearing father, I was struck by the way Barbara Kingsolver lays bare all the emotions of growing up that way--she is so true to life in every detail, including the strong bond she forms with her sister as a result of their shared childhood. Like so many of her books, I kept asking myself, &quot;How does she know me?&quot;"},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"Cosima \\"Codi\\" Nolina is a misfit in her own mind. She was too tall as a child; her mother died when she was very young and her prominent father, a small-town doctor, drummed it into the heads of both Codi and her little sister, Hallie, that they were different from the rest. His emphasis was \\"above the rest.\\" Their interpretation was \\"different\\". Yet, each daughter develops differently despite this constant message from her father.Doc Homero, as he was known, demonstrated his caring by enforcing rules, rules, and more rules. Nothing much escaped his scrutiny, including his enforced wearing of what both growing girls felt were unstylish, \\"orthopedic shoes.\\" In Doc Homero's mind this was his contribution to healthy feet.Both girls longed for hugs and demonstrations of affection, which were never to happen. Doc had his own personal battles...acceptance from the townspeople who remembered where and from whom he hailed. All the more reason for Doc Homero to keep reinforcing to his girls that he was from Illinois. I'll let the reader enjoy the unfolding of this mystery!Hallie is a crusader for human rights, political justice and preservation of the land. Here the reader will clearly see Kingsolver's activist sentiments, both from the understanding of a biologist's/environmentalist's perspective and also from the perspective of a political sympathizer who has seen historical injustices, as in the United State's role in Central America. Hallie is the personification of Kingsolver's stance.Codi, on the other hand, seems to hunker down and be perpetually absorbed with her lack of fitting in. She seems to view herself as an oddity and exalts her sister's courage, drive and commitment. Codi won't even accept a teacher's contract back in her hometown of Grace, for longer than a year. And as she strikes up an intimate relationship with one of Grace's former Native American bad-boys-turned-good, she makes it clear she won't be around after school lets out for the summer.Kingsolver's writing style is very engaging, it not only absorbs the reader in the plot but provides engaging characters as well, and also it educates the reader on Southwestern Native American culture, architecture, customs and folklore.It would really spoil the discovery process for the reader to divulge how everyone and everything works out. There is humour and sadness; there is beautiful imagery; there are both warm and passionate relationships; and there is personal discovery.Beautifully done!"},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"I am a college student and was assigned this book earlier this semester.To be honest I dreaded reading it,however when I picked it up and began to read I could not put it down.It is a very well written book that draws you in.Animal Dreams is about the sense of belonging.Codi is returning to her hometown to confront her ailing father and her past.In this book you will find a complex sense of culture,love,freindship,political issues environmentalism and as I said earlier, the sense of belonging.I highly recommend Animal Dreams.In fact,I recommend Barbara Kingsolver altogether.In my opinion,She has not written a bad book."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"This book is what books should be. Not only is the story powerful, but it is written with such lean and beautiful language that each page contains a perfect image or choice of words. It expertly plucks at a motley of heart-strings, no matter who or what you are. One of the best books I've read in a long, long time. My husband loved it too. Bean Trees and Pigs in Heaven are great too, but this one is my favorite."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"So far, Animal Dreams is the best of her novels. Kingsolver writes with much more interest in the present moment than a glorious future or past. The description of what it is like to feel like you don't belong on the planet is deep and hopeful."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"Kingsolver has a way of pulling me into her books, so it feels like I am actually a bystander watching the story unfold, not just the reader of the book. As I got closer to the last chapter, I found myself feeling sad. I felt like the characters in the book were becoming my best friends, and if I finished reading the book, they would be gone. I still think about them, but they aren't with me everyday like when I was reading the book. It's a very good read that makes you feel good about living"},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"This is a beautifully written story about a young, single (and emotionally isolated, by choice) woman, Codi Noline. The story takes place in the magical Southwest, in a Spanish speaking community in southern New Mexico. Kingsolver's writing about the land in the Southwest reminded me of the draw - the pull - that this part of the country has on many people. Throughout the story, Codi learns to trust her memories, her heritage, her emotions, but most importantly, the relatiionships in her life. Her sister Hallie, although not physically with her in the story, is a significant part of Codi's maturing process.Topics that the story deals with: pregnancy, miscarriage, Native American heritage, Nicaragua and US politics, sisters, how plants & humans interact, how animals & humans interact, mines, aquatic life, sex.A beautifully woven story - you'll love it!"},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"Animal Dreams by Barbara Kingsolver is enlightening and enriching. It tells two stories that lead in to one, Homero and Cosima. Kingsolver conveys to her audience about love and adventure. Her sensory imagery paints the perfect picture in the reader's head. When she describes the place where Codi is staying she says, \\"I heard the goat moving around outside, munching loudly and bumping against the wall. I opened cupboards. Everything was spotless. The east window in the living room looked straight out onto the granite wall of the canyon a few yards away, a startling lack of view. Emelina's place was the last and highest on her street, backed up against the canyon. The floorboards of her front porch were on a level with her neighbor's roof.\\" - And that's just the beginning of her sensory imagery.This book is not a good choice for anyone younger than a mature teenager for it has many scenes that are not suitable for them. In a couple scenes the characters may harm an animal and Kingsolver, while a very intellectual writer, is especially descriptive in these particular scenes. Also the book contains an intimate scene that is also incredibly descriptive. But don't get me wrong, this book does contain many life lessons a girl will experience growing up from a teenager to a young adult."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"I am not a fan of poetry, but I enjoy the poetic way Barbara Kinsolver writes about nature, life, relationships and family. This is a thought provoking novel, touching and real."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"In this compelling novel, the characters' relationships predominate--sisters, and lovers, and father/daughters will all relate to Kingsolver's creations. After a few years pass, often I only remember my gut reaction to a book, no matter how much I enjoyed it. Even after so much time, I remember these characters by name, and I remember the plot. It's a memorable read, most enjoyable in the summer!"},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"Currently I am reading this book in my English class. Everyone pretty much hated this book saying it was too hard but seriously, I really liked it. So just because someone you know says this book stinks like french cheese, you should try it anyways because different people love it and others hate it. In my opinion this book is more for girls than guys."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"A good story about a woman who really doesn't know herself returning to her hometown and finding out who she is and where she came from. She renews an old friendship and rekindles a lost romance while reconnecting with her father and learning the history of her family tree. She also learns what animals dream about.As a resident and lover of the desert southwest, I was interested in the accurate description of the landscape and the climate. I was also very interested in the explanations Loyd gives about the Native American's beliefs and history."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"I just love her. She's up there with Isabel Allende for me. &quot;Animal Dreams&quot; and &quot;The Bean Trees&quot; are two of the best examples of modern fiction I've ever had the privilege to read. The characters in &quot;Animal Dreams&quot; are incredibly well developed, as is the plot. I'm an incredibly fast reader, and I rarely reread books, since there are so many great unread ones out there! I can think of no greater compliment than to say that I have read and reread &quot;Animal Dreams&quot; and &quot;The Bean Trees&quot; more times than I can count."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"This book was the February selection of our book club and we all loved it. I loved the writing, the characters and the plot development. The story is multileveled about the Noline family secrets, about Codi and Loyd's romance, about Codi finding herself through having a cause and finding her chosen career, about Codi's relationship with her sister and father. The characters are sympathetic and well developed. I highly recommend it. This was my first Kingsolver novel. It made me want to read more of her work."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"I just finished reading this book for the second time, I read it about 4 years ago and for some unkown reason i picked it up agian. It is a beautiful book, in so many different ways. It has a voice a feel that I can't articulate, but that has touched me both times I have read it. Yes, it has flaws, but they add to its beauty - the overall story has an honesty and quirkiness which really transports the reader."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"Although there were some things that didn't ring true in this story, it is typical Kingsolver. A good read. I highly recommend it to anyone wanting a new twist on life."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"This book was so descriptive. It's the first book I've ever read by Barbara Kingsolver, but I plan on reading some more. Her characters are so thought out and well defined. You feel like you know them."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"This book, required by my high school as 11th grade summer reading, is one of the most AMAZING books I've ever read. Changing point of views from daughter Cody Noline to overbearingly protective father Homero Nolina, this book offers an insightful peer into two completely different yet similar people.I read this book over about a 1 1/2-week period. Never once was my time wasted. Intriguing, joyous, painful, extreme - all of these words describe this work of art.I don't want to tell any of the plot, because even having some distant idea of what goes on might take away.&quot;Probably there is no real invention in modern society, just an elaboration on nature.&quot; Talk about a quotable author, a memorable book. You feel the characters' sorrow and happiness, worries and actions, you feel the results of the actions, you feel a part of the book."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"I loved this book. Kingsolver does a beautiful job of tying in unique motifs with fascinating colloquial details throughout. This book is a wonderful book for anyone because it deals with topics of self-acceptance and family roots, but I would especially recommend this book to women as it has a lot of powerful female messages. It is charming, interesting, and beautifully written."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"I have to admit, I've been a fan of Kingsolver's for years, and Animal Dreams is one of my favorite novels.Codi returns to her hometown to watch over her ailing father, with whom she's had a rather difficult relationship. Her sister, Hallie, goes to Nicaragua to teach people how to farm the land, while facing the threat of violence. Codi is a medical school dropout who seems to wander from place to place, trying to find herself, in a sense. She is determined to stay in her hometown for only a year, accepting a teaching position on a temporary basis. Kingsolver gives us a lesson in politics, life, and love in Animal Dreams. Yes, at times she can be a bit overbearing with her political beliefs, but who can fault someone for having passion?"},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"Kingsolver has a knack for taking the ordinary lives of ordinary people and making them come alive. Although I didn't find this novel to have quite the character development or the plotline of The Poisonwood Bible, it's a great story about trying to find the road home. I found the storyline to be extremely realistic and all the more absorbing therefore. This is a novel about sibling connections, the wisdom of the town matriarchs, the struggle of land use in the West, the heritage of Native Americans, and the search for self-esteem in the least likely place. There are some great character sketches in here that anyone from a small town will instantly be able to identify. This is a good introduction to Kingsolver's work."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"I thought that the writing style was absolutely fabulous and engrossing. I was able to emotionally hook up and experience the book very vividly. I must mention that although I loved this sort of writing style, some less patient readers might find this as over descriptive.The plot was pretty good, but sometimes predictable and trite.Overall, I would recommend this book. Kingsolver's abilities as a story teller are amazing. In terms of her sort of writing style, I've never read anything like it."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"Sometimes a book is worth reading just for the ending. This was one of those for me. However, I also enjoyed the theme of returning to your roots. Having moved away from my hometown never to move back again, I related to her emotionally and respected what she went through."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"When my AP English teacher handed us Animal Dreams one day, I did not think I would like it. From the title and the cover, I was expecting to hate it. What I found inside was one of the best stories I have read in a long while, and it is a story I will be sure to remember for quite a time to come.We analysized the heck out of this book in class, and in some instances I think that can cause me to not like a book as much. In this case, I really think it only enhanced my love for it. I loved the story. It was so interesting, and so beautifully woven. Throughout the book, there were so many motifs that kept reappearing. It was really interesting to pick them all out and see where they would show up next.The characters were another really great part of the story. Codi was a really interesting narrator - her mind was so skewed, so seeing the story through her eyes left you to interpret different things and find the truth. Loyd was my favorite character of the book. I loved every scene with him in it - except the cock fighting ones, those just made me angry.This is something I definitely would not usually have picked up if not assigned for class. Books like this are the ones that really make me want to go outside my comfort zone of reading, and grab something new. Animal Dreams was a book I truely enjoyed, and I will definitely be checking out more from Barbara Kingsolver."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"Animal Dreams felt like anything but a dream to me. The emotion within the pages of the book felt real. The characters are the invitation to read. Though I can admit to not liking Cosima (Codi) for the first hundred pages or so, I warmed to her as she found herself.Codi moves to Grace to care for her ailing father. The story is told in the first person (from Codi's perspective) with the exception of her father's chapters, which are told in the third person. They reveal the insight of a father - careful to not love to love his daughters to outwardly.Codi grew up in the Gracela Canyon in the town of Grace. The town itself is an orchard in the middle of the Desert Mountains outside of Tuscon. The town reveals itself slowly, as a new friend does.Codi is reunited with visions of her past. There is Loyd, a native man she dated as a teenager. He is the soul of this book. He teaches Codi love in the most beautiful way. He teaches her about the land. There are the students of the school (that she once went to) who with the rest of the people in the town, give her the acceptance in life she had always desired. The Stitch and Bitch club provides her with the warmth of a mothers love. (Her own mother died when Codi was just three).And there is the Codi's sister Hallie. Hallie is the sort of literary character most destined to break your heart. She was what all people should strive to be - driven, caring, selfless.The innocence of the bond between sisters tugged at my heart as I read about her.This book was good, but not great. Barbara Kingsolver quoted herself too often, repeating words she had already wrote. It was as if she didn't trust the reader to remember which points were obviously important to the story.On a side note...She uses a piece of imagery I first read in a Steinbeck novel. \\"She'd watched a man sell shrimp from a bucket that was counterweighted with a plastic jug of drinking water. He drank as he went along, to keep the load balanced. The purity of direct necessity.\\""},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"As I began this book I was a little restless as I was not really \\"into\\" the central character, Cosima. The more I read, the better it got. Kingsolver has a beautiful way of bringing about change. In this case the change is a 180 for Cosima. By the time I finished reading I was ready for it to go on and on."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"Barbara Kingsolver is definately a talented writer. This is a work of prose but it reads like poetry. Her language is lush and warm as it lulls its readers in. She also has a great command of motifs and symbolism, though at times it feels like she has gone a little over the top with the 92nd mention of something. I sometimes found myself saying, &quot;Ok, ok, I get it.&quot; But then there are smaller moments, when you are slowly chewing over a beautiful passage and out of a dark corner in your mind you see a similar image from so many pages ago and you smile in recognition. I love how she presented her characters. Doc Homer is slowly loosing his memory to alzheimers, he is disconnecting from the world around him, and Kingsolver has placed his story in the third person. Codi, on the other hand, has returned to Grace and is struggling to regain her memories, slowly reconnecting to her former self, so it is quite fitting that she speak in first person. A beautiful touch, so simple, yet so thoroughly ignored by most writers.One thing that I found very wierd and for which I must criticize Kingsolver, is that there is no mention of where Codi's mother is buried. Burial sites are a common motif and to leave out the site of such an important character seems to be a major oversight on Kingsolver's part. She better have a pretty good explanation.I almost sold this book once. I'm glad I didn't. I don't know if it is for everyone, but what book is? If you want to read a book about love in all its forms, from familial to sexual, written by an amazing writer who will constantly treat you to beautiful prose and who will occasionally hit you in the gut with something so profound and wise that you must take a minute to catch your breath after a moment of awe, then you just might like this book."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"I have NEVER enjoyed reading. It is interesting to note that the majority of the very few reviews that rated less than 5 stars indicated that the reader HAD to read the book for or some other purpose than self enjoyment and discovery. I find it truly sad that a book such as this (and all the other amazing books by Kingsolver) could be so unappreciated in its beauty just because it was (un)&quot;Fortunate&quot; enough to be on a &quot;reading list&quot;. Thanks to this book (and all her others!), I have discovered the pure joy of literature. She is truly gifted."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"My favotire story now for over 5 years since I first read it. Warm overtones of Family & Place. I keep it next to the bed instead of a blankie now that I'm all growed up. Need I say more?"},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"My mother forced this book on me several years ago. After many months of whining and pushing on her part, I broke down and decided to read it with little joy. I was anticipating yet another piece of psychobabble schlock -- my mother's favorite form of \\"literature.\\" What I found was a powerful story about family, miscommunication, mistakes, and redemption. Yes, the setting is a little dated, but the way father and daughter hurt and misunderstand each other is timeless. This book introduced me to Kingsolver and an entire world of her characters. It is an emotionally difficult read, but well worth it."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"Barbara Kingsolver has the amazing ability to have her stories appeal to women on such a personal level, and use such descriptive diction to really make the reader get a mental picture. It then makes the reader feel even closer to the characters. In \\"Animal Dreams\\" you really got to feel for Codi as she went through tough times. When the book first starts out it is quite slow but after a short while it becomes so hard to put down. It is one of the few books I can actually read without being forced. Throughout the story Codi goes through many relationships, several jobs, different feelings about herself, and relationship toward her family. Her father confided in her about his brain tumor and she and her father were never close. She feels sorry for him and returns home to the town she grew up in Grace, Arizona to take care of him. She has a tough life and tries to overcome her past problems throughout the book. If you enjoy Barbara Kingsolver, this is definitely her best. I would highly recommend it to women, especially those with sisters and people who can relate. It is a very modern story of strife and overcoming social barriers."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"Barbara Kingsolver's books are not merely to be read, but should be absorbed, digested, and pondered. Her characters in this book, as always, are sad and their glasses are half-empty instead of half-full. Happiness eludes Codi, the main character but is close at hand if she will only reach out and grasp it. She is an aimless soul who quit medical school shortly before finishing and ended up back home where she checks on her ailing father, the town physician. Her relationship with him has always been uneasy, as her mother's death deprived her of important aspects of being parented, and her father was unable to fill the gap. Her beloved sister Hallie is in Nicaragua trying to save crops and thus people, and somehow Codi feels useless by comparison. Added to this, her parents came from Illinois to this remote spot in Arizona, and the family were always outsiders. This is a beautiful story of Codi's redemption and growing maturity. I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"Once again Barbara Kingsolver has managed to write a complex and winning story with wonderfully flawed characters that capture the hardships of real life. Animal Dreams is a page turning account of a young woman's struggle to find where she belongs in the world. The tale of how she finds her niche is emotionally gripping."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"I read this book under duress during the summer and I must warn all of you prospective buyers - DON'T DO IT!!! Please, save your money for a book with a plot! I have read some other reviews of this book - they say it is full of beauty and character. The only thing this book is full of is meaningless prattle. But, for all of you who have always wondered what the plants in your garden are thinking . . go right ahead!!!"},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"If you are the kind of person that likes Harlequin Romance novels, then Barbara Kingsolver is the author for you to check out. If you find people sleeping with Navajos exotic, then this novel is for you. Can you hardly wait for the following: Over the top symbolism? Cramming vague morals down your throat to leave you confused? Character that you can't stand? Wantingso badly for the perspective character in the novel to die that it consumes you? If you answered yes to any of the following then Barbara Kingsolver is the author for you."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"This book makes no sense, like you don't understand what is going on the whole time. It was a joke of a book to be nice it honestly wasted my time the only reason i read it was for school. It was confusing and just was terrible. If you get this book u r wasting ur money and ur time. If you want to read a good book read The Whore of Akron, great read. This was just terrible. So what if I only read like 8 chapters and sparknoted the rest it still was confusing and made no sense. That is why i had to spark note cause i was lost and had no idea what was going on."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"I returned this item to the sender. My order was for a new book. When my purchase arrived, it was yellow pages (obviously old) with a name written inside the cover page. It was used - not old. I returned it to the sender with a letter and asked for my money back. Have not heard from them as yet. I was very dissatisfied with this purchase, the first one that was not up to what I ordered from Amazon. So, I am out the cost of the book, the shipping fee for the book coming to me, and the cost of shipping to send it back. I was unable to take the one star off of the rating below - I would not rate this with any stars. Disappointing."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"I tried to read this book, first time around I got half way through, then got bored. It was certainly descriptive, even if I could have cared less about the characters. Also, the writer doesn't write her characters to be likable. So just what is her point?I tried to read it again, and totally didn't like Kingsolver's style of writing. She is boring! Also, she just tries to use big words to make up for lack of talent. This is pure drivel.Try Cathie Pelletier, now there is a writer!Kingsolver is all hype."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"This is, unequivocally, one of the most boring books I've ever read. Makes Hemmingway look exciting..."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"That's the only word to describe this book. Amazingly stupid. Every word of every sentence of every chapter is garbage. Apparently since I am a male I have to live with the stereo type of not being compassionate or sensitive enough to understand 200 pages of babble.Some friends of mine had suggested this book and I can't believe I took them seriously. This must be a cruel joke they are playing on me. The complete absence of story is alarming. It's 300 pages of assorted whining: everyone likes my sister better, I don't have a cause, I don't have anyone to sleep with, I don't fit in anywhere I go, I had a crummy child hood, the poor central Americans. BOO HOO.This book is worse than any of the mass-produced love stories you find at airports. Please spend your money on something more worthy."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"Borring, but a few good spots, worth it for extra credit, but not for fun reading."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"This book was assigned for Summer Reading. It is okay, but takes the life out of you to write a report on it. With this idea, it was an awful book. Also, there are some sexual scenes in it which I would not recommend for the younger audiences. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone who hates reading romance novels. It makes me shudder to think that I read a romance novel."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"WORST BOOK EVER! Kingslover destroyes and dismisses all of the characteristics that create a decent novel. This book is devoid of any plot or driving force for the main character to face. Kingslover has the uncanny ability to spend hundreds of pages, for a main character to dream and wish of a past that she clearly never had and cannot reclaim. As pointed out by a friend of mine during Senior English (the year myself and others were forced to read this atrocity), all of the lessons that one could possible come away with from this book are present in the Disney film, The Lion King. \\"Remember who you are\\", and remaining true to your past, all of which are present in a kid's movie. I would reccomend this book for anyone who enjoys, reading about horny Native Americans, and 300 pages of liberal dribble so humanity shan't forget the electrical engineer who died in Latin America. To quote Comic Book Guy \\"WORST BOOK EVER!\\""},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"Animal Dreams is smart and funny and heartbreaking all at the same time. Two sisters - one who incorrectly ascribes all of her heroic childhood acts to her sister, and the other, who really has grown up to be a hero. How much of ourselves do we define, just by believing it hard enough, and how much of that is the belief of other people around us? I often don't like books about women who have lost everything, but that's because the idea of willing victimization and an inability to function annoy me in a book (can you hear me, She's Come Undone?) but there are no victims in this book. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"Barbara Kingsolver is one of my absolute favorite authors. She writes about characters like Codi, a woman that hasn't yet found her place in life. Codi returns &quot;home&quot; to Arizona and we learn about her father and sister Hallie. Codi struggles for come into her own and find a place where she belongs. In contrast to some of Kingsolver's other novels, Animal Dreams is short and easy to read. The plot is unique and the characters are interesting."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"I liked this book, although Poisonwood Bible is even better. I'm disturbed by some of the negative reviews here. If you read her novels carefully, it is obvious that Kingsolver is writing about people trying to understand each other, not about converting people. I liked the motif of animal dreams and the relationships delineated within the book."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"I VERY MUCH LIKED THE FIRST HALF OF THIS BOOKTHE SECOND HALF------????------WELL??FROM ABOUT THE POINT IN THE BOOK THAT LOYD IS A SERIOUS CHARACTER---THERE WERE TOO MANY DIFFERENT WAYS THAT THE BOOK WAS HEADING.WAS IT ABOUT POLLUTION?? WAS IT ABOUT INDIAN LORE??? WAS IT ABOUT NICARAGUA???SORRY---I JUST DIDN'T LIKE THE SECOND HALF."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"I probably would not have finished it. Poisonwood Bible is my first exposure to this author, and I thought it was one of the best books I'd ever read. But...I had a hard time getting into this one. In the beginning the book jumps back and forth between past and present, as well as from different points of view. This worked very well in Poisonwood Bible, but was harder to follow in Animal Dreams.Second, the protagonist--Codi Noline, is really not all that likable at the beginning of the story. It's only when you get about half way through the book, if you've managed to hang in there that long, that you learn why she's the way she is and hope for her to change. Ultimately, the growth of this character and others made the novel enjoyable for me in the end. The second half was much better and more emotionally fulfilling. I'm glad I stuck with it."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"I was quite disappointed that a book that was marketed as literature could be filled with so much garbage. I found the main character's discovery of the native Americans to be not much more than the &quot;noble savage&quot; mistake. Especially nauseating was her reference to the &quot;bread that smelled like love.&quot; Although I agree with the author's point of view about Central America and about the environment, I found her so preachy that I wanted only to disagree with her!! One bright spot is the inclusion of sections written in the father's point of view. These parts were ethereal, poignant and not sappy at all. I'd only recommend this book to someone who likes romance novels but is embarrassed to carry around those garrish softcovers"},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"Read this on vacation in Hawaii.

She writes so well and interesting that I had to continue reading Pigs in Heaven and one more I forget the name, now. I will continue reading her books and highly recommend others do the same."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"This is a romance story. It seems to have more to it, with her sister going off to Nicaragua, her Dad in the early stages of dementia, getting to know Indian culture, but at its heart it is a romance. It is interesting to read about this other stuff.Codi has come home to help her Dad and earn a little money by teaching high school biology. She finds she does not recognize anything she grew up with and a lot of the people. This is the story of her coming to terms with her past. The town of Grace, Arizona is just struggling to stay in existence: the mine closed and the menfolk have taken any job they can find or they move to someplace with work. There is a lot of history in the town, only a hundred (100) years or so, but it is an important part of the people. Part of what Codi finds in her past is a family history she never knew, but connects her with the town.A large part of her past are her high school years. Teaching in her old high school brings it all back in force. Sometimes she has to deal with kids of folks she went to school with. She seems to remember only the bad times, the meanness, that she had to endure there. Of course, this is all pretty redundant for most of us. Who enjoyed or has good memories of high school? For most American children, high school was traumatic. All the emotions and everyone needing to grow up is bound to make the high school life somewhat bad for everyone at some point.The mine closing is something I am happy I missed. It was bad enough when the miners struck. My Dad had just bought a service station in town, now no one had any money to spend on gas or service, so he eventually just gave it up and went back to his old job. Today the place that was a gas station is an accounting business or something like that."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"I bought this copy to share the tale with my mom, who is currently volunteering on the Navajo Reservation, close to where this book is set - she's enjoying it as much as I did. This book deals with a number of hard truths that have been below many folks' radar: corporate pollution, elder care / alzheimers, exploitation of indigenous peoples, US efforts to destabilize legitimately elected governments in South America, exploitation of working class folks & union-busting, etc. But it does it without a sense of preaching, as the lead character finds out how she is linked to many injustices, and despite regarding herself as just a transient person who doesn't want to and can't effect changes, she begins to discover that she does care, can make a difference, and can even belong to a unique place and people that can become HOME & FAMILY to her. Like most of her books, she doesn't gloss over the harsh realities of life, but still her stories end with an empowering realization that comes out of the situation, even if it doesn't solve all the characters' troubles.I've yet to find a Barbara Kingsolver book that doesn't change my life for the better. They all touch my soul and teach me about being more human and rooted in the place I live, but they also teach me a lot of very useful science and facts, without lecturing to me. My favorite of her books, Prodigal Summer, even taught me an actual medical therapy to ward off the syndrome \\"Benign Positional Vertigo\\" which I'd been experiencing for a while without knowing what it was, yet this was just a minor thread in the plot, not the essence of it. Her books all have a level of complexity to the plot and characters that forms an intricately interlinked web of connections and results in a unity greater than the sum of the parts. I can't fully explain why I love her work - it is just something you have to experience for yourself."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"There are several 'threads' in this book that met my interests. I connected with the environmental, political, family & cultural themes. The story woven thru these themes is enticing. It was, as I've found in other Kingsolver books, organized by presenting the protangonists & laying the foundation for the story in the first half of the book. Then, the 2nd half of the book, 'takes off' entertwining the characters with a compelling story that makes it hard to put down. I'm reading it now for the 2nd time, because one reading only leaves me feeling that I may have missed something! Excellent book!"},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"Barbara Kingsolver uses amazing imagery and her voice is authentic, this was an enjoyable read, I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Animal Dreams","review":"My response to fiction depends largely on the author's ability to create an entire world I can observe and, to some extent, inhabit.The good news is that Barbara Kingsolver creates such a habitable world in Animal Dreams. Like one of my wife's more ambitious crocheting projects (and yes, she got her own chuckle out of the \\"stitch & bitch club), several interesting threads are woven together - an itinerant medical gypsy, a high school biology class, a malevolent corporate entity, contemporary Native Americans, desert hideouts, housewives, railroad engineers. The body of knowledge is impressive, as is the authenticity of the created world that emerges from it. Where normally one has to plod through the beginning of so many books before a climactic event renders them suddenly \\"interesting,\\" with this book, I wish the beginning portion could just go on forever.Where the book does fall short of perfection is in its two principal climactic events -- the news of (freelance agricultural missionary) sister Kallie's capture by the evil \\"contras\\" and her subsequent death, allegedly at their cruel, American-sponsored hands. It's just too abrupt, giving inconvenient credence to the old writing school cliche of putting the pistol on the mantle in act one so you can shoot someone with it in act three. Also, Kallie is too much of a Joan of Arc. Why does the narrator think all these guys are so crazy about her?Although I enjoyed the ending, I would have preferred for the author to take up more of the themes at the beginning of the book and dig a little deeper. In particular, something insightful should have come from the boyfriend character learning he had fathered a child with the narrator. What if the haunting dream voices he thought came from his lost brother really came from his lost son?Still, having completed this Kingsolver offering, I will seek out others, eager to further explore this wild and fascinating world of contemporary human ecology in the Arizona desert."},{"Title":"Inbreeding, Incest, And The Incest Taboo: The State of Knowledge at the Turn of the Century","review":"Thanks, book shipped fast and i was in good shape.

But you can't hide who you really are and this book helps us all understand just how wrong we are to use animal names as stimas to try and label a person. Because their incinuation is often plain wrong.This book on the contrary helps you get more into understanding why you are labelled a certain way and mentions that any any Animal we might be associated with can change on a whim due to circumstance.The book is a great way to help us get a better understanding of ourselves and can really help us develope who we are.

Animals do have personalities so theres a level of understanding there as you can connect with your animal personality. The one thing I'd hafta say about this book is that theres 45 animals in it, and theres at least 850 in the world, so for people like my digital graphics and animations teacher who's a turtle personality (which isn't listed in the book), nothing really matches up in the book with himself. That might be the reason why some people took the test and still haven't figured out what they match.Gawd, this book is great! I keep plenty of notecards with the book since they fill up fast with numbers, and I get alittle snippy about how people hold the book since its not holding up so well as paperback, but (...)its a great way to figure out the person next to me. *wags fox tail* the personality matches up almost to the letter, and I was rather amused to find out my boyfriend was a wolf (although not suprized), and my closest friends are carnivoure personalities."},{"Title":"The Animal In You: Discover Your Animal Type and Unlock the Secrets of Your Personality","review":"Interesting book. We had a great time testing everyone. While almost everyone agreed with their animal personality, only my weasel brother-in-law had any objections."},{"Title":"The Animal In You: Discover Your Animal Type and Unlock the Secrets of Your Personality","review":"This book is two-thirds pure entertainment and one-third insightful social commentary. Author Feinson's premise is that human culture is populated in much the same way that the animal kingdom is laid out. That is, humans mimic the predator and prey relationships of the other members of the animal kingdom in both proportion and passion. Thus we end up with large proportions of human counterparts of sheep, deer, and cottontails (prey), and relatively few examples of lions, wolves and crocodiles (predators).Blending the selfish allure of the daily horoscope with the voyeuristic pleasures of watching animal courtship on a nature show, &quot;The Animal in You&quot; offers a chance to &quot;discover your true animal type and unlock the secrets of your personality.&quot; By means of a short and easy self-test, and a somewhat intimidating, but obviously thorough, eighty-some pages of tables, you can quickly find out if you're an owl or a dolphin, a weasel or an elephant. Each animal personality offers a brief overview of the genuine animal, it's human counterpart, and short sections on careers, relationships, advice and a few amusing examples of celebrity examples. It's no stretch to learn that Liberace was a peacock, Woody Allen a snake, and Michael Jordan a giraffe.While Feinson obviously has good background in animal behavior and dedicates some serious discussion at the beginning of the book to understanding the relationship between man and animals, and to translating animal behavior to our homo sapiens agenda, it is clear than he does not intend us to take this book too seriously. Once this is understood, the book is a great deal of fun. Once one finds out one's own animal brother or sister identity, the real fun begins by taking the test for one's spouse, boss, friends (and enemies)! I always knew my boss was a warthog and my brother-in-law a weasel, but I was surprised to find out my wife was a cottontail - not the best mate for a bat like myself.A great casual c! offee table book to leave out at parties, &quot;The Animal in You&quot; might have been better served being published in hardcover - after only two weeks on my desk at the office, it's cover is &quot;dog-eared&quot; and the test-page covered in &quot;hen-scratches&quot;. This book serves as a reminder of our inextricable link to our animal brothers and sisters and offers the reader an entertaining and often surprisingly revealing glimpse into our own &quot;nature&quot;."},{"Title":"The Animal In You: Discover Your Animal Type and Unlock the Secrets of Your Personality","review":"As a fulltime professional psychic reader and party psychic for over 37 years, I have had ample opportunity to see that we are all animals at heart. Some of us are eagles, and some lions, and some sea otters/prairie dogs, and some sea lions and some titmouses and some badgers and some weasels --Hey, let's leave the Bush Admiinistration out of this!Even more clearly (which, frankly, could have been brought out better in this book, along with the astrological side in general; yet the book is so revolutionary I still give it a \\"five\\") most of us are a combination of various animal consciousnesses evidenced in a progressive heirarchy of ascendency, dominanace, and trying-to-work-it-all-out-together personality evolution(which is where the Eskimos and the Australian aborigines got their totems from -- showing a multiplicity of animal energies working together in every life and social organism -- kind of like notes and chords in a musical composition of the soul -- which matches the astrological motif after all).Animal evolution is not so different from spiritual evolution, is it, spiraling between prey and predator, land, sea, and air?I for example fashion myself to be an Eagle, Owl, Lion, and Teddy Bear (or, in the latter instance, other real live animals who are more innocent, cuddly, and cute) in that order. Some people are the reverse -- nice on the outside, tough or predatory on the inside.In fact, merely being able to tell if someone is naturally a Predator (lions, weasels, tigers, snakes, and Republicans) or an Herbivore (cottontails, sheep, horse, bison, donkeys, or Democrats -- the political take is of course mine, not Mr. Feinson's) can be very helpful in your dealings with others. And isn't it interesting how prey-predator motifs can apply to relationship and sexual and business and social and cultural and religious dynamics of all types?Thus, what I would have liked to see -- and I give you fair warning, I may write a book covering more about this later -- is the association of animal appearances and indentifications with eastern and western astrology:Including an awareness that in astrology, the Year of the Pig can look and act a little bit like a pig often with a piggie nose (like Year of the Pig Members Marie Osmand, Julie Andrews, Zero Mostel, Ernest Hemingway, and Jean Harlow) -- and be pigheaded if you try to turn them into prey, goring you with those obstinate victim-playing tusks.And in western astrology Scorpio members, for example, often strongly resemble the Scorpio-ruled creature the eagle (Indira Gandhi -- and Mohandas Gandhi a Libra with Scorpio rising -- Murray Abraham, Teddy Roosevelt -- with lots of owl in his case -- Edith Head, or a baby chickadee eagle like Goldie Hawn or Leonardo DiCaprio). This goes with the general Bird Consciousness Mr. Feinson so astutely observes and elucidates.Indeed, some of us bird types prefer the air to earth, just try to catch us when you want earthly commitment or a narrow perspective!We are indeed all animals -- and plants and minerals and angels -- as life is all one. And understanding our animalian roots helps us understand our personalities and behaviors as so-called \\"humans\\" in this lifetime Just don't tell me most of our current politicans and world leaders are all that human! -- I see lots of vultures and warthogs and snakes and wolfowiczes among them!Mr. Feinson pulls no punches in this department either. He calls a warthog a warthog. (If i called someone a warthog -- as I have been tempted -- at a Psychic Party, I would never work in this biz again!) And while I am not sure that aninmal natures can be digitalized from test questions -- although he seems to have done as fine a job as could be done with this approach -- I nonetheless HIGHLY reommend this work as a real thought-provoker and consciousness-enhancer and just plain hoot --That's owl."},{"Title":"The Animal In You: Discover Your Animal Type and Unlock the Secrets of Your Personality","review":"This book was a very fun book for a person who is very social or goes to alot of bars, but if you are a \\"lone wolf\\" this book will only entertain you only so much.It is a fun book, but you might sell it to Half-Price books when you are done with it.P.S.

After reading Max Hastings' Bomber Command, I became interested in the individual memoirs of many of the men he profiled. That's how I came across Bomber Pilot by Leonard Cheshire. I've always been fascinated by the bomber crews of World War II and what made them go up mission after mission. In the RAF, it was particularly brutal because so many logged 50 to 100 missions (if they survived). The pressure was enormous. No one wanted to be labeled as \\"lacking moral fiber\\" by their commanding officer.I didn't know anything about Mr. Cheshire before I read his book, but I love first person accounts of the war. What's make this work unique is that it was written during the war, published in 1943, while the author was still flying. The book covers his first couple of years in the war, first flying Whitleys, then Halifaxes. The descriptions of the crews and the airplane are both vivid and technical. That's a special gift. You feel like you are one of his crew during the missions; the tension is excruciating as they grope their way to an airfield in pitch blackness, low on gas and being pounded by wind-driven rain.The book is honest; he does not hesitate to criticize. Highly recommended. Remarkably, Cheshire went on to become one of the RAF's most decorated bomber pilots and have an equally amazing postwar career aiding disabled veterans."},{"Title":"American Gulag: Inside U.S. Immigration Prisons","review":"Given the current focus on the mistreatment and torture of detainees in Iraq, Guantanamo and elsewhere and the debate over the origins of this abhorrent behavior, this is a very timely book. As well as describing the Kafkaesque intricacies of recent Immigration law, Dow documents the mistreatment of non-criminal detainees, showing that the abuse of human beings in detention has a long and institutionalized history within the United States. This book is further argument against the Bush Administration's insistence that the recent prisoner abuses in Iraq are isolated incidents, perpertrated by a few low-level prison guards. In fact, it is a reflection of common practice in a penal system that is as much out of control as the Iraq war situation. Dow writes with remarkable clarity, while treating both the incarcerated and their guards with humanity and respect. It is long past time that this secret world of incarceration has been brought into the light. Congratulations to Mr. Dow!"},{"Title":"American Gulag: Inside U.S. Immigration Prisons","review":"This book was a multi-year project. The author visited INS holding facilities, privately run prisons, and local city and county jails, all of which provide beds for illegal immigrants, criminal aliens and legal residents who have committed crimes and are awaiting the result of their deportation hearings.Some are criminals who deserve to be incarcerated, while others are caught up in minor disagreements over the length of a tourist visa. A group of Israeli young people who were arrested while they sold toys at a local mall, all of whom were in the US legally, and claimed they were told by their employer that they had work visas. The young women in the group were interrogated while in the custody of the INS for approximately three weeks, by law enforcement officials who demanded to know what mosques these Jewish girls visited while they were in Toledo.The situation is far more dire when the detainees aren't highly educated, don't speak or read English, or are recent-enough arrivals to America that they believe every interrogation by police will end with them being executed. Cultural mannerisms and faith-based requests are not well-understood, especially by the guards who work in local and privately-run jails and prisons, and this leads to a great deal of conflict, including physical and verbal abuse of detainees.Some people won't believe that the author is reporting the truth. However, much of what Mark Dow writes has been corroborated by other researchers, especially about the inherent dangers of a privately run, for-profit prison system."},{"Title":"American Gulag: Inside U.S. Immigration Prisons","review":"immigration practice and policy is america's deep, dark secret. people are detained indefinitely for reasons that are often trivial and sometimes non-existent. this book shines a light into immigration policy and the detention facilities where noncitizens are held. everybody interested in how our justice system treats noncitizens should read this book. democrat or republican, conservative or liberal, this book will outrage you."},{"Title":"American Gulag: Inside U.S. Immigration Prisons","review":"Excellent book.

The author marshals facts, interviews detainees and prison officials alike, and evaluates the economic incentives for crossing borders and for building private prisons. What results is a nuanced presentation of how a flawed system can continue to grow multiple heads and club feet even when those involved are just \\"doing their jobs.\\" As the author suggests, the abuses that occurred at Abu Ghraib are not the result of evil individuals; rather such abuse is a necessary corollary of treating people as less than human and permitting private prisons to lobby for lucrative contracts to warehouse non-dangerous \\"criminals\\" with little oversight and every incentive to cut corners. It is said the best way to bury the truth is to hide it in a book. That so few people are outraged by what is commonplace in immigration detention centers suggests the truth of that statement: the facts can become invisible based on our collective desire not to see them."},{"Title":"American Gulag: Inside U.S. Immigration Prisons","review":"Very informative.

It worked for me and I don't think I'll ever be fat again!I especially appreciate Danna's transparency about her personal struggles, including marital infidelity. What a great example of helping women see who we are and where we find our identity. So often, we find it in a man, a job, our stuff, our looks or our weight. Because she was secure in her identity in Christ, it didn't change who she was when her husband was unfaithful or even if her weight was over the top. I think a lot of women can benefit from this healthy way of dealing with this all too common heartbreaking issue. While marriages don't always survive, she shows it is possible.

For Nick Tosches, that obsession over the past quarter-century has been Emmett Miller, a now-obscure minstrel singer from Georgia who recorded for OkeH and Victor in the '20s and '30s. When Tosches first wrote about Miller in the mid-'70s (in his book &quot;Country&quot;), little was known of Miller. No photographs of the man were known to have survived, little biographical information existed, and his music was difficult to find in print. Over the course of the next 26 years, Tosches and a few associates tracked down leads and rumors about Miller's origins, until a somewhat better picture of the man started to emerge during the '90s. A few photographs turned up eventually. His grave was found in a bad section of Macon, Georgia. And one by one a scant few people who had known Miller or had worked with him turned up with hazy, somewhat unreliable tales of his career. Which raises the question of why Tosches would spend so much time and energy chasing after the ghost of an obscure singer who had died - alcoholic and penniless - in 1962? Part of the answer is that Miller was a truly gifted vocalist whose unique style influenced the likes of Bob Wills, Tommy Duncan, Leon Redbone, Hank Williams, Merle Haggard, and others. Part of the answer is also that Miller's music is nearly uncategorizable; his unusual vocal style made a strong impression on country singers in years to come, but his music wasn't country by any stretch. In fact, with backing on his records by the likes of Tommy and Jimmy Dorsey, guitarist Eddie Lang, and drummer Gene Krupa, Miller was rubbing shoulders with some of the best jazz musicians of the era. Finally, Miller's career took place during the final years of minstrelsy (the history of which Tosches devotes musch space here), and Miller represented a last flickering spark in the embers of blackface musical comedy before dying completely during the Great Depression. Ultimately, Tosches' quest was only partially successful at best. We get a picture of the major events of Miller's life; his birth, the essentials of his career, his marriage (late in life), and his death. But of the man himself only dim hints; brief glances at the contents of a room in the split second after a light bulb flashes, then burns out. Gaps of knowledge still exist, as Tosches freely admits, but he's followed the trail as far as he thinks he can and leaves it now to younger scholars. A consistently fine work, in the now-well-established Tosches style. If one complaint can be made, it's that photographs of Miller and the book's other subjects might have been included. But perhaps it's for the best that none are present. Pictures of Miller aren't all that hard to find at this point - they're out there if you know where to look - and if anything the lack of photographs lends to the ghost-like portait of Miller that Tosches paints."},{"Title":"Where Dead Voices Gather","review":".... But not. When he's writing about Emmett Miller and the history of minstrelsy, he's brilliant. Not only did he do a ton of original research on Miller and minstrelsy and early American music (blues, jazz and country, before any of those three were genres; even the categories are foreign to us today), but he can tie it into modern musical ideas like no one else. He makes these shadows come alive for a minute, which is amazing; you can almost smell Miller in the room. And his exploration of these roots pulls together many previously ungathered threads.However, he goes off the deep end, as usual for Tosches. Too many Ezra Pound discursions, for starters. If you're trying to impress us with your deep knowledge of foreign languages, you'd best not quote extensively from that old fraud, who \\"translated\\" buttloads of poetry from languages he couldn't read (with \\"help\\"); this taints Tosches with the suspicion of similar overreaching. It's great that he has read up on Greek word roots, but these links are too tenuous; it's a little bit of showing off and doesn't really illuminate anything. If he wants to write another book carrying his musical history ideas back from English ballads to ancient Greece, go for it, but here it just looks like dressing-up time. Stick to the blues.And though Tosches is a great critic of the pop music of his time, like all of his contemporaries in that game (Meltzer, Marcus, ad infinitum) he's every bit as stuck in a particular rut as those he would criticize. He's quoting Iggy Pop and Patti Smith again, folks.But while those complaints are serious, they don't detract from the fundamental brilliance of the story. It's a terrific, if languid, detective story, as well as an opening into a new world of understanding popular music. Tosches is the only \\"rock\\" critic ever who could have written it, which is a pity. I don't see how you can understand where our music came from without this book. Read it."},{"Title":"Where Dead Voices Gather","review":"Nick Tosches brought Emmett Miller onto the stage of writing about American popular music about 20 years ago in his magic-realistist imagined chapters on Emmett Miller in his original edition of Country Music about 20 years ago. At the time, his comments were imaginary because we knew so little about Miller. As Tosches wrote, for all we knew then he could be running a candy store in Jersy City.Over those twenty years Tosches found out about Miller and records a lot of that information in this book. This is great selfless work by Tosches and by other scholars who were inspired by his work and by Miller's music.Well, this is not fiction, this is what we know about him, about minstrelry, about his life. You can't blame Nick for the fact that the truth is a bit less colorful and still less filled in than fiction.Also, Tosches is no academic and does not pretend to be. He's music's best and most literary representative of the new journalism.Miller is important. He was good. His music sounds great today. If you don't think so, you need your ears adjusted, your sense of life, love, and joy revived. He may not have been a financial success, but critical trend setters, particularly in Country Music, have styled themselves after him to this day.Bob Wills--another former blackface perform-- combined Emmett Miller, the blues of the MIssissippi Sheiks, La Musica Ranchera, and ranch dance music into Western Swing. Wills auditioned his singers throughout his career by asking them to sing Miller's hits and comparing them to Miller. Wills recorded songs identified with Miller throughout his career.Hank William's biggest success was essentially an imitation of an imitation of Miller. Merle Haggard has acknowledged his heritage by recording a Miller tribute album and usually does a Miller-Wills number during every concert. Leon Redbone gets a very large amount of his singing style and personna from Miller.The problem of minstrelry can't be discussed without discussing race and culture in America in a way most people can't discuss it, like it is a real problem that is really there and part of the discoursde, win or lose. I don't exactly agree with Tosches' take on the problem, but, at least, he approaches the issue honestly and put it in the center of the discourse where itbelongs.Perhaps, unlike Tosches' Country Music and Hellfire, this is not a book that belongs in every home, every school, every library, every bookstore, but it belongs on every bookshelf of anyone interest in American popular music, especially country music and Western Swing."},{"Title":"Where Dead Voices Gather","review":"Nick Toches has written a loving, rigorous and MAJOR history of music in America. One other reviewer in these pages writes that he feels the author was bored by the time he wrote this information down. For this reader at least, NOTHING could be further than the truth. Toches shows us that his compendious heart and brain are not satisfied by anything less than EVERYTHING.It's a book about human memory and the hunger to set the facts and liner-notes straight by reaching out to touch the men and women who once lived by their music. Toches' hunger is ravenous and overwhelming. As the poet Jonathan Williams has written: GET HOT OR GET OUT! To read this book you need patience, the patience to love the richness of all the twistings and turnings, the hidden connections, the links of these songs and their singers with our own times. If you want to know about histories of the Blues links to Minstrel singers and Country and Rock and the age of Crooners...and...You'd like to walk with the Devil but God Bless You Mr Toches for bringing back a world.A Stunning Achievement."},{"Title":"Where Dead Voices Gather","review":"finding stuff on emmett miller is very hardi bought The Minstrel Man from Georgia and fell in love with his voice right away and emotion behind it thank you for providing info behind the voice and the man, i am far from a racist and anybody who claims emmett was a racist is covering up their own problems.this book is perfect for anybody who likes roots and blues and early country wish there were pictures though"},{"Title":"Where Dead Voices Gather","review":"Emmett Miller's name has been whispered in hallowed tones for years in serious music circles. He is a true source point for the \\"blue yodel' so populorized by Hank Williams and countless others which came in his wake. This book delivers the goods with style and sincerity. Buy It! Also, get the cd of Emmet's outstanding work. it's really something to yodel about."},{"Title":"Where Dead Voices Gather","review":"If you read only one book about Emmett Miller, make it this one."},{"Title":"Where Dead Voices Gather","review":"A wonderful examination not only of the life and career of an obscure minstrel-show performer, but a wildly entertaining exegesis on the whole of American show business, especially the routes in which ideas are passed down from generation to generation, transmuting all along the way. You'll never think of minstrelsy quite the same way again. If you read this book carefully and well, you will realize that blackface performances were more than just public displays of hate, as the current popular thinking would have it. It could not have been the dominant form of entertainment for the better part of a century if it were nothing more than an avenue for racist expression. Minstrelsy, in fact, became the first area of entrance for blacks into mainstream popular entertainment. But, as I mentioned before, the book is about a lot more than that---more than this review can contain. If you are interested in music, show business, language, history, ANYTHING---buy and savor this fine piece of work."},{"Title":"Where Dead Voices Gather","review":"There are books that I really like, and then there are books that affect me. This is one of those rare books that hit me where I live. While some reviewers were troubled by Tosches' rambling style, I was smitten with it. I eagerly followed him around the country and back and forth through the years. The search for Emmett Miller seemed like just a flimsy excuse for Tosches to write a combination meditation on and history of American music. Reading the book, I actually became more fascinated with 1920s guitar virtuoso, Eddie Lang, who I'd never heard of before, but who played with Miller, Lonnie Johnson, teamed up with boyhood pal and violin virtuoso Joe Venuti, and became the guitar player of choice for so many others, including a young Bing Crosby. Thank heaven for Mosaic Records, who helped me feed the need for Eddie Lang recordings.If you're looking for a straight \\"point A to point B\\" biography or history, this will not be your book. But if your looking for a delightful ride through American music, hop aboard."},{"Title":"Where Dead Voices Gather","review":"The legacy of American minstrelsy is, complex, mysterious, and a sort of genome of the American musical spirit. Tosches understands this and has the intellectual capacity to follow the origami like folds of this cultural double-helix. And he has the journalistic virtuosity to write a joyously readable account of his research. Where Dead Voices Gather is a tour de force of Americanist musicology."},{"Title":"Where Dead Voices Gather","review":"Fact-wise, terrific: Tosches piles 'em on, as usual. He's a unique, gifted writer, even if one doubts certain of his conclusions, as one does in this book.However, he's too disingenuous by half or more when it comes to his difficulties in regards \\"finding\\" Emmett Miller: after dissing academic critics and their lofty takes on the matter at hand, he segues into his difficulty in locating whether in fact \\"Emmett Miller\\" existed under that name at all, after pages of discussion about how he agonized over pinning down the man's existence (actually a cohort located the pertinent records); one can't help but wonder how, since the approximate locale (Macon GA) was a given, Tosches didn't do what any academic researcher would have done immediately: in lieu of a birth certificate, immediately check the census records, and the school records. He could have easily found the info 20 years ago, at the start of his search, if he had've used bona fide methods of academic research. Instead, he heaps on the melodrama. Bosh! Tosches comes up as rather a tosspot, given his criticism of the academics.A serious flaw at the outset of even a good book causes one to wonder about other of the author's conclusions, and methods in reaching them."},{"Title":"Where Dead Voices Gather","review":"It's hard to know if Virgil sat and wondered, dismayed, at the withering of the Word, listened to words crumble from the mouths of fools with all the decay of ruined cities but none of their beauty. In the heaps of books written about everything, badly, and about things whose innate qualities make anything about them from the start dubious, to find, to trust a writer with your/our time is a thing not easily done. Music today defies critique like a handicapped person being graded on a test that's beyond their ability. This is not to equate them, for a handicapped person has far more substance, intelligence, beauty, honesty, in short, true humanity, than the music being made today and the pawns playing it; but, it is to say that something incapable of a certain level of intelligence and responsibilty, will never meet the requisits of worthy criticism. Through Emmet Miller, Nick defines what these requisits are.Like Ezra Pound and Picasso taught us last century, the true critic is the artist. These are the people that take the soil, fertile from the dead that lived before, and create life; who take the changes of old and make the rock of new that is always filled with the ancient and holy ghost, soul, living now. Through Nick's eyes and ears, we are escorted beyond the walls that keep our songs and poems, our muti-colored peoples seperate, into a realm where everything corresponds and reverberates in relation to everything else, no matter how distant.Where Dead Voices Gather is not just a book about Emmett Miller, the great minstrel singer, but about all the living and all the dead and how we conceive of ourselves and the surruounding world. From the blackened face of these performers to the ladders of dna that will ever climb and entwine through our bodies and limbs, we find answers that rework what we thought before."},{"Title":"Where Dead Voices Gather","review":"I went on a bit of a Nick Tosches binge , reading this book , THE DEVIL & SONNY LISTON , and TRINITIES , in one week's time .

But in the end, there is only so much we can know -- time has passed, Miller didn't leave much of a paper trail, and few people who knew him survive.So Tosches pads it out with endless, rambling digressions into every topic that happens to come up -- the origins of the term WOP, how ragtime originated, musings on how classical authors presaged the meaning of the blues, capsule biographies of every session musician who participated in a recording, cross-referencing recordings of the same number and drifting into doing the same for some other number that the first one evokes, giving every review of Miller's performances on the touring circuit from town to town even when the reviews all largely say the same things over and over, and on and on, all without chapter breaks.Tosches self-consciously wields this &quot;excursus&quot; fixation as a kind of tic that he challenges the reader to either get used to or put the book down. Okay -- I &quot;get it&quot;. He wants to paint a picture and share his love of the lore in the meantime. But the occasional breathless parenthesis is one thing; 300 pages of almost unadulterated aimless, self-indulgent cross-referencing is another.Buffs of early country music and the blues might cotton to all of this signposting and obsessive chatter about obscure recordings. But beyond that, this book is virtually unreadable past the first 50 pages or so, and I highly suspect that the editorial reviewers falling all over it did not actually read the book.This is a smug, solipsistic party trick, not a book written for anyone outside of the author's own head."},{"Title":"Where Dead Voices Gather","review":"Most writers write to convey information to the reader while a few write to display their knowledge and their vocabulary. Mr Touches does the later. If you met him he would begin spouting everything and fact that he knew in the same way he does in this book simply to astound you. I f you like Emett Miller, buy his CD and skip this book.This writer is a boor."},{"Title":"Barney's Mother Goose Hunt","review":"The book is great for inspiring your toddler to participate in reading. While the book is not heavy in plot, the child is asked to find objects that are in the nursery rhyme and pictured on the page. My toddler is 2 and was overjoyed to be able to accomplish what the book asked. It is challenging because the pictures are quite lively. It teaches a child to concentrate on the task at hand and not to be distracted by other activity. The classic &quot;concentrate,work hard, and you will succeed&quot; book.

And what makes it even more fun is that below the poem there are 4 to 5 objects that your child can search for.

It says it covers 5000 plants, but it's really almost 7000 plants, the biggest encyclopedia of perennials ever. Chock-full of fascinating sidebars about planting suggestions, name changes, invasive plants, orchids, etc. Pictures are gorgeous and there are thousands of them. An ultimate reference. Kudos to Graham Rice, the veteran plantsman and wonderful writer, for creating this ultimate encyclopedia."},{"Title":"Encyclopedia of Perennials (American Horticultural Society)","review":"This is a great resource for advanced gardeners interested in learning about a variety of species within a genus. I have been able to identify many lesser known plants that I have inherited using this book. It tells in-depth information about the genus and lists several species with pictures of many of the species. There is very little info about when plants bloom or where they should be planted.

At first, this volume was a little intimidating because it is organized by the scientic names of all the plants. Once I got the hang of looking up the common name in the back, then finding the cross-referenced scientific name, it's wonderful! My friend, a much more accomplished gardener than I, used the book to help with our plant sale and the questions customers had about the perenials we had for sale. The pictures are amazing. I have identified in my back yard many of the plants I'd been previously pulling as weeds...I'm also looking up how to separate and move these wonderful newfound treasures, so the book can pay for itself -- all in all, a great investment!"},{"Title":"Encyclopedia of Perennials (American Horticultural Society)","review":"I've had time to look through this book and I am pleased with it - I found pictures of most of the plants I didn't know in my new garden. Also, I enjoy the tips about how to decide what to plant together, based on height, color, and blooming time. That is a subject I did not know enough about, and this book has some wonderful and easy to understand ideas. The only thing I would add is the common names of the flowers to make looking them up easier. The pictures are great and the information is clear and easy to understand."},{"Title":"Encyclopedia of Perennials (American Horticultural Society)","review":"This is not the most user-friendly resource, but it is by far the most comprehensive perennial Encyclopedia available. If you are familiar with the AHS Encyclopedias, this book is very similar and borrows heavily from those resources. As you would expect from AHS, this is a high quality production with gorgeous images and detailed information. This is an essential resources for the perennial gardener, there is nothing more comprehensive."},{"Title":"Encyclopedia of Perennials (American Horticultural Society)","review":"This is a marvelous compendium of plants. Almost 500 pages of plant descriptions and beautiful color photographs make it a book that the curious gardener will dip into again and again. Plants are listed by genus and species, and a good number of cultivars are listed. Each genus is given a general description, followed by how it is best grown, how it's propagated, and what pests it has. Then follows the various species within the genus, descriptions including origin, size, bloom time, color and size, scent and occasional tidbits about medicinal use or the like. One thing I love about this book as opposed to many other plant encyclopedias: it gives the American zone hardiness of the species.But this is not just a straight encyclopedia; interspersed with the plants are sidebars and boxes with information on combining the plants to make beautiful vignettes that put plants with the same needs together, the structures of various types of flowers, plant history, diseases and pests of plants, and detailed propagation instructions for certain plants.This book is great for looking up information, but it's also wonderful for just leafing through it, stopping at reading at random spots- did you know that the Barlow type aquilegias make seed that's true to type, while all other aquilegia's promiscuously cross breed? And here I thought those Barlow girls were just as bad as their cousins! Drooling over this book has given me a lot of new ideas for the garden, and left me with serious zone envy."},{"Title":"Encyclopedia of Perennials (American Horticultural Society)","review":"This book is fantastic.

Growing up a baseball player Willie Mays was someone to idolize, and with the way he played, this was easy to do. What was most sad about this book was the fact that Willie ended up a great career having little money to show for it, and had to become a greeter at a casino to make ends meet. One can only imagine how much money he would command now, and how he would be set for life in today's current baseball climate. If A-Rod gets $25 million a year, than Willie would get much more. This book gets points for being an honest look at Willie's life, from his own perspective, and for that I aplaud him. If you like baseball, you will like this book."},{"Title":"Say Hey the Autobiography of Willie Mays","review":"The autobiography of Willie Mayes portrays the life and times of one of America's best baseball players. Willie Mays played with a style and flair unmatched in this day and age. The book describes his trials and tribulations growing up in the deep south.It is a very well-written autobiography, and if readers are into baseball or Willie Mays this is an excellent selection. It is an excellent selection because it is a profile of American baseball and the way we idolize professional athletes."},{"Title":"Say Hey the Autobiography of Willie Mays","review":"I liked this book. Sticks mostly to Willie's playing career with little about his personal life outside of baseball. Some nice anecdotes and comparisons with he, Mickey Mantle, and Duke Snider, stats per season, talks about relationships with the team managers and other players, etc.... really fun stuff.Not much off the field. Like, he never mentions Bobby Bonds, which was strange to me since Willie Mays became the Godfather for Barry Bonds when he was born in the mid-sixties. I'd recommend it, but this book didn't resonate with me like some other sports bios (Bill Russell's \\"Second Wind\\" and Jackie Robinson's \\"I Never Had It Made\\")."},{"Title":"Say Hey the Autobiography of Willie Mays","review":"not a bad book just the style of writing didnt captivate me at all. just not my cup of tea might be yours though."},{"Title":"Say Hey the Autobiography of Willie Mays","review":"There are newer books on the market about Willie Mays, but this is still the best because this is Willie telling his story in his own words. I've read it several times. You often hear it said that Willie was a very gifted athlete, but his own words give you a sense of just what an intelligent player he was - dealing with the winds at Candlestick Park, for example. Or how he positioned the fielders, depending on who was hitting. This book also gives you a sense of his underlying decency - how he handled the Juan Marichal/John Roseboro incident, or responded to Alvin Dark's comments about black and Latin ballplayers. And of course, you learn about his close relationships with Leo Durocher and Herman Franks, managers of the Giants in the 50's and late 60's. Recommended for all fans of the Giants, Mays, or just great baseball."},{"Title":"Say Hey the Autobiography of Willie Mays","review":"The book Say Hey! has one my vote for one of the greatest autobiographies of my time.

This story will tell you about how he grew up in broyklen playing stickball in the streets with all of his friends. When this great ball player got his chance to play baseball for money he took it. He first started out in the Negro leagues for the New York giant's minor league team and then he finally got his chance to play in the bigs and play centerfield and right field because the rightfeilder was really slow so the coach had him playing two positions. When he went up to the bigs, he really helped there team go all the way to the World Series to play against the Indians. The giants swept the Indians in three straight games and took the pennit.I would recommend this book to anybody out there who loves the game of baseball.

A strong advocate of developing a disciplined practice of meditation, Kornfield has a very nice way of communicating this necessity without scaring the novice off. He has a great reserve of wonderful stories and anecdotes which make his suggestions spring to life.

Kornfield is a exceptionally fine teacher and I consider this book his best."},{"Title":"A Path With Heart - A Guide Through The Perils And Promises Of Spiritual Life","review":"I follow a pathway of self-teaching, formerly with a teacher, and now on my own. Kornfield's book was of immense importance to me in making my decision to stay or leave a particular metaphysical church group following disclosure of the married teacher/minister's affair with a fellow student. He succinctly and with HEART put into words my emotional reaction, gut feelings and intellectual musings of the situation, resulting in my growth as a human being. I decided to leave the group because it was unable to maintain what I believed to be a minimal standard for behavior, and Kornfield was able to assist me in deciding what my boundaries would be.

It wouldn't have come so far so fast, that's for sure. In A Path With Heart, Kornfield once again proves he is the master of gentle spiritual learning.

While Kornfield is Buddhist, this book embraces all wisdom traditions. For those new to the path, no matter what tradition, this book presents invaluable information on how to walk the path and avoid the costly detours and potholes. He deals sensitively and expertly with issues such as finding a teacher, how teachers go astray, how to deal with problems and complications that arise on the path and how to avoid them in the first place. The Bible says &quot;Straight is the path, narrow is the gate, few find it.&quot; Kornfield's book enables many more to find it.I found this book after many years of spiritual study and meditation. I wish it had been available earlier. I recommend it to all my beginning students."},{"Title":"A Path With Heart - A Guide Through The Perils And Promises Of Spiritual Life","review":"Jack Kornfield's beautiful book is one I first read as an undergraduate, when I first became interested in Buddhism. Since then, I have read scores of books on the subject, and I think that this book ranks with Suzuki's Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind as one of the best books available on the Buddhist perspective.The text is unfailingly heartening (no pun intended) and provides meditation exercises throughout.Truly, the book can awaken the dormant heart within any of us."},{"Title":"A Path With Heart - A Guide Through The Perils And Promises Of Spiritual Life","review":"I have studied with numerous meditation teachers in the Christian, Zen, Theravadin, and Hindu traditions and have read practically EVERY Buddhist Meditation book published over the years.

Several points hit very close to home for me. I found It is very approachable and readable..highly recommended."},{"Title":"A Path With Heart - A Guide Through The Perils And Promises Of Spiritual Life","review":"Subtitled \\"A Guide Through the Perils and Promises of Spiritual Life\\", this book lives up to its promise and offers a serious, yet enjoyable and readable look at living under the influence of (or in the bosom of) an Eastern religion. Kornfield is a Buddhist, a former monk in the Thai Theravadan tradition, which is affiliated with the Insight Meditation movement. I first came across this book at an IM center, and am very glad I picked it up. In contrast to many Eastern writers on Buddhism and spirituality, Kornfield has not only extensive experience as a practioner and teacher but also as a middle class American. He speaks to us straightforwardly in a calm voice and in familiar language. His advice is wise and sympathetic; and he illustrates his points with anecdotes of people and experiences he has known.It is a little difficult to outline or explain the territory that Kornfield covers since it includes all aspects of spiritual life. He basically goes over, in a mostly unsystematic fashion, how to develop such a life. Meditations are suggested, and problems and stages of growth are examined, as we move toward a goal of spiritual maturity, wherein one's spiritual life finds compassionate expression in everyday life. What really distinguishes Kornfield is his humanistic and non-abstract take on things. He appreciates the value of psychotherapy and confronting emotional issues rooted in familial or painful experiences, but without viewing them as all-important, and in this sense brings Western and Eastern thinking together. He looks at potential problems in relationships between gurus/teachers and students and in being part of a spiritual community. The sublime and the difficult, the painful and the revelatory, are all a part of the author's purview. He reminds us that spiritual life is not something distant or ideal, but an integral and essential part of all life. This is a must-read for any Westerner with a serious (or not so serious) interest in Buddhism and Eastern spirituality."},{"Title":"A Path With Heart - A Guide Through The Perils And Promises Of Spiritual Life","review":"This book is exactly what every teacher of an adult class or study group is looking for.

I got a set of tapes, I think it was _The Inner Art of Meditation_ from the library and found myself rushing home at the end of the day because I /got to/ listen to the tapes and meditate.I've gone to sittings with J.K. at Spirit Rock in Woodacre, CA &amp; have always come away inspired and with renewed commitment to my practice.I'm afriad this book hasn't caught my attention. I've picked it up and put it down many times over the past year and a half, finding it dense and far from the esence I am seeking. I highly recommend the tapes, I highly recommend Seeking the Heart of Wisdom: The Path of Insight Meditation (Shambhala Classics) (Joseph Goldstein, Jack Kornfield). I also recommend _After the Ecstasy, the Laundry: How the Heart Grows Wise on the Spiritual Path_ (also J.K.)J.K. is a great teacher.

Jack Kornfield uses stories and lyrical language to weave a portrait of an authentic spiritual life characterized by insight, compassion and wisdom. He makes Buddhism accessible to modern people and shows us how it is relevant to modern life. This is no small task and Kornfield pulls it off brilliantly, with warmth and an entertaining style. I highly recommend this resource for anyone who is looking for deeper meaning in their lives whatever their specific beliefs. It is also an important book that connects Western psychological thought to Eastern worldviews.If you like this book, you may also findToward a Psychology of Awakening: Buddhism, Psychotherapy, and the Path of Personal and Spiritual Transformationa great next step in your explorations. John Welwood casts a broader net and has a more intellectual approach that compliments Jack Kornfield's more heart-centered story-based way of bringing this wisdom tradition to the West.If you are looking for a concise essay on Buddhism, then theThe World's Religions: Our Great Wisdom Traditionsby Huston Smith has an excellent relatively short, but information packed essay on Buddhism and another on Hinduism which helps place Buddhism in its historical context.If your area of interest is more toward Tibetan Buddhism, then you might enjoyIndestructible Truth: The Living Spirituality of Tibetan Buddhism (Ray, Reginald a. World of Tibetan Buddhism, V. 1.)andSecret of the Vajra World: The Tantric Buddhism of Tibet (Ray, Reginald a. World of Tibetan Buddhism ; V. 2.). However, be warned that Ray is a scholar, the book is long and while it is interesting, it is very detailed. If you are just looking to get a feel for Tibetan Buddhism, then you might want to tryThe Art of Happiness: A Handbook for Livingby the Dali Lama. While it doesn't dive deeply into Tibetan Buddhism in a comprehensive way, it does draw out many aspects that are relative and useful to Western people in improving the quality of their lives. Another good short introduction isFundamentals of Tibetan Buddhism. This is probably the best choice for people who want the basics, a context to place them within and something that is very accessible to the average person.If you want a better feel for Jack Kornfield, I would also strongly recommendYour Buddha Nature: Teachings on the Ten Perfections. This is my favorite audio book by him and I own them all. I have listened to these CDs (and a taped version) literally hundreds of times.

For some, Vajrayana is more suitable, for some, Zen is more suitable.Jack, although has been trained in various traditions, his main theme is along Theravada tradition (using Vipassana meditation method), specifically the lineage of Ajahn Chah. For my own practice, this book has been tremendously helpful to work on different aspects of the meditation and spiritual development. The chapters serve as guidepost and sign, sometimes as pointers of what we should pay attention of during certain stage.The chapter(s) of challenging our own demon and persistent negativities are especially helpful.If you want to walk step by step through Vipassana Meditation, this book is highly recommended."},{"Title":"A Path With Heart - A Guide Through The Perils And Promises Of Spiritual Life","review":"BUY THIS BOOK!

Toward the end it begins to bog down into a very esoteric, difficult to follow discussion on the nature of reality, etc. Kornfield also covertly attempts to set a left wing political agenda by framing traditional liberal arguements in spiritual terms.

It is a truly amazing read. I am sure I will refer to it for many years to come."},{"Title":"A Path With Heart - A Guide Through The Perils And Promises Of Spiritual Life","review":"This book is inspiring. Kornfield makes many important points, the most central being: does your path have a heart? I understand this to mean: reflect on what is most valuable to you in life. Read about the experiences of people near death and what they consider to be the best parts of their lives. Then ask yourself: is your path leading you to this valuable center of living?Jack is excellent at describing the perils of spiritual striving: the ways that by striving to attain some fixed notion of \\"spirituality\\" that we actually increase our self-divisions and compartmentalization. I agree with him that working closely with a healer (which could be a psychotherapist, or could be someone with a different title) is necessary to resolve stuck family karma and to see into our blind spots."},{"Title":"A Path With Heart - A Guide Through The Perils And Promises Of Spiritual Life","review":"Twenty years ago, when I was a college student, I got turned on to spirituality largely by reading Ram Dass' &quot;Be Here Now.&quot; Kornfield's book could do the same thing for thousands of people today (to the consternation of apologists for other religions!).A Path with Heart is pretty much my favorite book on spirituality. It contains both useful practical advice on living a spiritual life and amazing esoteric descriptions of super-normal states. Numerous pages contain &quot;gems&quot; that speak directly to my personal struggles and experiences. And Kornfield has a great sense of humor with deep compassion.One of the things that attracts me to Buddhism is its relative lack of superstition and dogmatism. The essential teaching is practical, down-to-earth, and perfectly acceptable to a scientifically minded person. Still, many Buddhists believe in reincarnation, and Kornfield describes some pretty far out experiences involving, for example, reincarnation, angelic beings, and psychic powers.Kornfield is a wonderful writer, and I hear that he is such a good teacher that one has to enter a lottery to get the chance to go to one of his retreats. He seems to be a charismatic, highly advanced being (though, who am I to judge?). But he would be the first to warn against starry-eyed adulation of him. An oft-repeated theme throughout the book -- and the topic of one whole chapter -- was the need to beware of unhealthy, exploitative relationships with teachers. Every spiritual seeker has one or more fallings-out with a teacher, he says. These fallings-out can be painful and damaging, but we must learn to learn from such events.Many people get the impression that Buddhism is an austere, impersonal, ascetic religion, with little of the bhakti (devotion) found in many Christian and Hindu faiths. This book challenges that perception. Indeed, it's amazing how loving Buddhists can be, considering that they tend not to believe in God! One thing that impresses me is his apparently complete lack of cynicism and pessimism. Kornfield has only good things to say about every major religion.In fact, another theme of the book is that Buddhism too should not be treated as a dogmatic teaching that we should grasp on to. Rather, it is a tool to be used to get where we want to go. Teachings and paths should be left behind when no longer needed, like a boat used to cross a river. (I'm reminded of Kornfield's story about a retreat in which two of his students, a married couple, were struggling hard to relax into meditation. Kornfield advised them to stop being so serious and to make love. They started to show up in the meditation hall smiling.)I'm still not completely convinced that a spiritual seeker can get by without faith and trust in some sort of divine being or essence. But this books goes a long way to showing how an atheist can have faith and hope.If you're on a spiritual path, or even if you're just curious and open-minded, read this book.

I've read several other wonderfully erudite and inspiring authors on Buddhism, meditation and spirituality lately, but Kornfield's gentle pragmatism (particularly his advice on meditation and mindfulness in daily life) makes this one of the most endlessly useful books I've ever read, as well as one of the most affecting.

His voice and advice is articulate, intelligent, humorous, open, patient and wise. He starts out by telling you a little about his own experience, goes on to cover the basics of vipassana meditation and then leads you bit by bit deep into the issues every meditator and spiritual seeker must face. What I love most about his teaching style is that he gives gentle, practical advice on the day-to-day, minute by minute stuff to do to explore, commit to, love being on the path.

I read a chapter a day, which I recommend to people new to Buddhism because it allowed the information to sink in.Some information --like sections on karma, chakras, and lovingkindness meditation-- will be familiar to a general audience (it's interesting how many of these concepts have permeated the New Age and mainstream culture, e.g. Gary Zukav's &quot;Seat of the Soul&quot;--- read by Oprah's audience-- covers the same karma concepts.) Other parts -- like a section on mind altered states-- may surprise some.It doesn't surprise me that Buddhism has become popular in the States, particularly in the Western States... it is a de-institutionalized religion with a practical approach to problem solving.

I was simply not ready for it. But when the time was appropriate, it became an indispensable guide. Jack Kornfield is one of the gentlest, wisest teachers alive today, and I feel lucky to have come across this profound book. A word more on the gentleness of Jack Kornfield. After spending a number of years at Theravadan buddhist monasteries in Southeast Asia with renowned Buddhist teachers, Kornfield returned stateside and even edited a fairly technical compilation of meditation techniques by Theravadan teachers. In the four decades since that time, Kornfield's focus has generally been on healing and compassion, matters of the heart. I believe this was a deliberate decision to salve the rawness of hurt wrought by contemporary American culture. While all cultures have problematic aspects that create tension against an individual's spiritual needs, Kornfield is keenly sensitive to the wounds caused by perfectionism and isolation (not helped by nuclear families and divorces) endemic in ours.A wealth of insight on various components of the spiritual journey are found here. Particularly helpful for me was Kornfield's insistence that the Path must lead to an ever greater opening of the heart. When there was temptation to be captivated by extraordinary experiences, Kornfield led me back to the sorrows and the tranquil joys of the heart. After all, some of the most extraordinary and nurturing moments in our lives, such as suckling for milk from our mothers as infants, are also utterly ordinary and devoid of fireworks. Kornfield skillfully urges us to let go of whatever it is that we are clinging to. In some of my darkest moments, there was a gentle reminder to remain grounded. And perhaps due to the particulars of my upbringing, it was a gentle guidance that I most needed to negotiate the troughs of the spiritual path. Most important of all, Kornfield encourages us to trust our innate inner wisdom. While the book is replete with vivid technical descriptions of the stages one can encounter along the path, it is Kornfield's emphasis on maturing as a compassionate individual that has sustained me.One more thing: many talks by Jack Kornfield's can be downloaded for free at the dharma seed website. I wish you the very best in your own path, and may it be with heart."},{"Title":"A Path With Heart - A Guide Through The Perils And Promises Of Spiritual Life","review":"One must simply read and listen to everything written or spoken by this great contemporary teacher on insight meditation and the path of mindfulness.

He is very outranged by Kornfield and others of his ilk. He states that Buddhism causes the ceasing of ALL suffering. And that Kornfield's mixing psychotherapy in the form of Jungian and Reichian therapy is rapidly turning American Buddhism into diluted root beer. I would like to give a quote from this book. Then maybe you can decide. Page 245. &quot;Problems such as early abuse, addiction, and difficulties of love and sexuality require the close, concious, and ongoing support of a skillful healer to resolve.&quot; Well, my good friend Ed in San Antonio and I have had very little luck with therapists in an accumulation of over 60 years with a multitude of therapists. Jack's pure love of psychotherapy and fame seemed to have rocked his brain. Does he know what he is doing? Nhat Hanh suggests in one of his books that what he calls &quot;The Five Wonderful Precepts&quot; can cure childhood wounds. If Jack thinks that we shouldsit at a CoDA metting with a Teddy Bear named &quot;Fluffy&quot; on our laps while we cry out what our Mommy and Daddy have done to us, then okay. Page 221. &quot;We can reflect on how needs were met in our family, how limits were set, how insecurity was treated. Until then, we will repeat them in our spiitual life. Twelve Step meetings offer participants to hear the personal stories of other members. This honest telling of our family story can be a powerful process in our sorting out health from dependence, respect from fear, and finding a wise and true compassion.&quot; Well, Jack, I've been to 120 12-step CoDA meetings. I've lead groups. And I've spilled my guts for ten minutes which is supposedly healthy. Everybody seems to be involved in the John Bradshaw view of blaming your parents and your past. This is dharma?

I've always been an Agnostic/Buddhist, since 16, but I was thrown off track by many things in life and growing up. Now that I have returned with the knowledge I already know on the subject, I picked up A Path With Heart, which surprisingly, was a book I have always had.My elder sister (40), believes that Everything Happens for A Reason, I am still unsure, but many times I find myself dumbfounded how sometimes everything at once will fall into place accordingly.I have an extensive library, and both my Fiance and I are Agnostic/Buddhist.We read together constantly and share an intimate silence in the process.The way of the Spirit is very strong within me, I know, but I have been reading the wrong material, I believe, thus far.A Path with Heart is my awakening...I picked this book up about 3 years ago now, from a book thrift store.I'm not sure how it caught my eye or why I even bought it, I just did, without knowing anything of it.This happens to me a lot.But what is most interesting to me is, by the time I do sit down and read it from cover to cover, I realize why I felt so compelled to buy it and that it has a future purpose in the thought process and reasoning in my life.No book I have ever attained, has gone to the trash.In the various literature I attain, each volume benefits me on some kind of level, its fascinating to me.And boy do I have an array of literature.In my lifetime, I have read over 2500 books, and I'm just starting out.For those who are thinking about buying this book, but don't know, my advise to you is this: Take a chance, read it carefully, and make your choice, to Take the One Seat..."},{"Title":"A Path With Heart - A Guide Through The Perils And Promises Of Spiritual Life","review":"This book will be especially enjoyed by those who have read and been forever touched by the Carlos Castenada Classics on the teachings of Don Juan which is the origin of many of these concepts."},{"Title":"A Path With Heart - A Guide Through The Perils And Promises Of Spiritual Life","review":"But it is difficult to imagine that if you listen to this book, you won't be happier when you finish."},{"Title":"A Path With Heart - A Guide Through The Perils And Promises Of Spiritual Life","review":"A psychologist e-mailed that when I gave this book one-star before, I was very incorrect.

This book is a must read for ALL practioners. Jack makes a code for the ethics of teachers. This book covers all those questions you are afraid to ask. Psychotherapy and meditation as a form of treatment is covered in detail. If you are going out of your mind, Jack has a whole algorithym of how to deal with these &quot;demons&quot; as he calls them. If this doesn't work, go to step 2. And so forth. So I would recommend this book for anybody, but not everybody. Jack states that meditation is not psychotherapy. Well, I talked to a secretary at the Insight Meditation Society which Jack created. And she told me that Insight Meditation is HER therapy. And please watch out a little for the suggested reading.

All the mystery is replaced with how 'meditation' will be such an aid in making one righteous. EMPTINESS and NO-SELF (rather wondrous buddhist teachings) are treated, in my opinion, to a very one-sided interpretation. Only those taken with 'sitting' will find this book inspiring.Here's a sample:'As our development of self grows and our heart becomes less entangled, we begin to discover a deeper truth about self. We do not have to improve ourselves; we just have to let go or what blocks our heart.' (pg. 209)This sounds rather too psychological for me. If its psychology we're advocating (very pragmatic) then lets call a spade a spade. Aren't we merely using 'meditation' to work on ourselves? Oh, and all those 'paradoxical' buddhist terms really are nothing more then the way Easterners talk about what we call psychology, only they use 'meditation' instead of a couch! It's ok if one feels that way, however, that may obscure things that don't fit that profile. The real danger here.\\"Wishing to get out of birth and death, wishing to attain release, you try to become unified; but one does not attain unification after becoming homogenized. If you try to make yourself unified, you will certainly not attain unification.\\" Chan Master Foyan (1067-1120)"},{"Title":"A Path With Heart - A Guide Through The Perils And Promises Of Spiritual Life","review":"Too many previous notes all through the book, very used but described as \\" lightly used\\"C Cripps"},{"Title":"A Path With Heart - A Guide Through The Perils And Promises Of Spiritual Life","review":"I can sincerely say this is an excellent book but that it is not the correct book for me at this time. Books tend to be time sensitive documents, meaning if you read one at the \\"right\\" time, it can light fireworks under your butt, while if you had read the same book at an earlier or later time of your life, you might toss it aside and pick up instead the latest copy of Time (pun intended). My experience with what is probably Kornfield's most widely read book is somewhere in between, but again, this may be on account of personality or timing. Anyway, having read the book and announced this caveat, I'll plunge in to my review.First let's nail down what the book is about, because it's not immediately clear by looking at the table of contents. The title comes from an oft-quoted passage from Carlos Castaneda's first book, The Teachings of Don Juan: A Yaqui Way of Knowledge:\\"For me there is only the traveling on paths that have heart, on any path that may have heart. There I travel, and the only worthwhile challenge is to traverse its full length. And there I travel looking, looking, breathlessly...\\"The spiritual life is not just a path, but a forest, with infinite numbers of highways and byways and small trails, and if you're not careful, or don't have a good guide, it is easy to end up at a dead-end or some bad place you never intended. This book is meant as a guide or map to this terrain.Its range is necessarily vast, covering everything from the important questions of one's life (\\"Did I love well?\\") to making peace with oneself (\\"dealing with our stuff\\"), and initial attempts to train the wayward mind (the \\"puppy\\" as Kornfield puts it). Salient topics such as the stages of insight and the perennial debate of True Self versus No-Self are considered from Kornfield's typically ecumenical and gracious standpoint. The particular issues of Westerners dealing with abuse, codependence, and self-loathing are tackled, and the positive role psychotherapy can play in unwinding these issues is also discussed. Karma is defined and the necessary role of compassionate, helpful work as \\"meditation-in-action\\" advocated.Kornfield is one of the godfathers of the American meditation scene, and his vast experience, sensitive expression and insight are abundantly on display. It is not surprising then that while I would heartily recommend it as an introduction or preliminary text to one's sadhana, it also bears reviewing at later stages of development. In other words, this is neither a book for beginners, intermediates, or advanced students of the Way; it's for everyone, since everyone at all times is running into at least one or two issues discussed in the book.Quality-wise Kornfield's insights, suggestions and clarifications are impeccable. He is a very human and down-to-earth guide, one who sees beyond the starry-eyed ideals of perfection many traditions advocate (cf. Ingram's Mastering the Core Teachings of the Buddha for more on this), and while the Theravada is his \\"home base\\" so to speak, his vision is all-embracing as regards the varieties of approaches one can take to the contemplative path. I would recommend this book even to dyed-in-the-wool Christians--maybe an evangelical or two... (but maybe not)--without hesitation. I don't see how it could fail to inform or advise someone, regardless of where they are. In the end, sincerity and a desire to learn are what count.Despite all these good points, I found myself constantly irritated by Kornfield's writing. It is, to say the least, a little on the saccharine side; nay, sometimes it went down like seven packs of Splenda in my coffee. There's a little too much \\"wisdom and compassion,\\" \\"heart,\\" and \\"joy,\\" \\"being\\" and Buddha-nature here, and in Kornfield's world everyone is a \\"master\\": a Zen Master (with both words capitalized no less, like it's a job title or something), a meditation master, a spiritual master, or just plain master. I'm sorry, but not everyone can be a master. If you've been on retreat for ten or more years or you're a natural-born genius, you might qualify, but these sorts are rare; the word is overused. To make a long story short: Kornfield is heavy on the \\"fufu jargon,\\" and for a spiritual curmudgeon like me it just doesn't fly.This kind of writing is unabashedly \\"popular,\\" politically correct, and \\"nice.\\" The above is symptomatic of this, but his willingness to water down passages quoted from other (especially traditional) sources, to massage them into accordance with his way of presentation, also points to this tendency. I groaned at one point (page 74) where, when quoting don Juan (from Castaneda), Kornfield felt it necessary to stick the word \\"spiritual\\" in front of the word \\"warrior,\\" as if without we might all think he was advocating something he clearly wasn't. Two pages later an even worse example of this sort of heavy-handed editorializing reared its ugly head. In Kornfield's words, the Buddha said:\\"Just as the great oceans have but one taste, the taste of salt, so too there is but one taste fundamental to all true teachings of the Way, and this is the taste of freedom\\" (76).The source is Udana 5:6 in the Khuddaka Nikaya, where from the original Pali we get \\"Just as the great ocean has one taste, the taste of salt, so too this Dhamma and Discipline have one taste: the taste of freedom.\\" Clearly, the Buddha was describing his teaching, not anyone else's, but Kornfield, liking the passage, \\"adjusted\\" it to fit his message. I think you can see why this sort of thing, indulged in on a regular basis, would rub some people the wrong way.So, the brilliant and witty, the philosophically profound and the airy-fairy--it's all here and much more. I will leave you with some sage advice on this book from Daniel Ingram, who called A Path With Heart a \\"masterwork\\":\\"Only major problem is that is it so nicely written and gentle you might not realize how hard hitting it is. Assume it is very hard hitting and technical despite its friendly tone and you will get more out of it.\\""},{"Title":"A Path With Heart - A Guide Through The Perils And Promises Of Spiritual Life","review":"i was turned on to Jack Kornfield through Joe Frank ... and it's taken me a longer time than I thought it would to buy this, but I love listening to his words and how he guides the meditation process.

It's a fine example of wisdom and compassion, of tolerance and discipline, of shared joy and personal responsibility. It is an inspiration. It is good to encounter an author filled with Buddhism's optimism and realism.--This book, and its outlook, is also an excellent antidote for times when one just feels kind of briefly overwhelmed by the negative craziness in the world (in other words, dukkha).

If you tend to like or even seem to need a warm instead of cool, analytical approach, I heartily recommend this book.

Here, the path of spirit reveals to us qualities of our inner self that moves us to incarnate our inner awareness/soul into the world. As we become more aware of our awareness, we begin to identify with our soul's guidance in the world over our personality's need to be in control. In this surrendered state of being, we become our authentic self. We become more soul than body living in the world, and yet, not fully of it.

Amazon.com does not currently recognize the need for different reviews of different editions of the same work. This review is of the edition of William Blake's Marriage of Heaven and Hell published by U Chicago Press (2011) for the Bodelian library and edited by Michael Phillips. Some of these other reviews really need to be deleted as they are completely irrelevant to this specific product. I will be writing here about the hardcover edition. I have not yet seen a copy of the paperback edition.This beautiful and professionally-bound U Chicago edition of MHH appears to be a cover to cover facsimile of the Bodelian's copy of Marriage of Heaven and Hell. I mean \\"cover to cover\\" quite literally: the image posted here as the cover is a full-color photographic reproduction of a nineteenth-century binding, wear marks and all. Upon opening the book you will find a full-color reproduction of the inside cover, handwriting, bookstamp, and all. The next page -- which is a blank page in the original -- is again reproduced exactly, water stains and all. What you will be purchasing with this edition, then, is an exact reproduction of Copy B of the Marriage of Heaven and Hell from cover to cover, with the addition of Phillips's extensive introduction, textual transcription, notes, commentary, a checklist of copies, and bibliography. There's simply nothing like it; not even the edition published by the William Blake Trust for the Illuminated Books series. Owning this book is as close to owning an original copy of the Marriage of Heaven and Hell as you can get.The William Blake Archive does have Copy B of the Marriage of Heaven and Hell online with a textual transcription, so you can preview the specific contents of the reproductions there. This edition, however -- being a full, cover to cover reproduction of the book owned by the Bodelian -- includes several additional plates that aren't part of the same sequence of images available on the Blake archive website (though probably available by selecting the individual plate and clicking \\"compare\\"). These additional images include several different copies of what is Plate 14 in the Bodelian copy with alternate copies of a few other plates from the MHH (such as A Song of Liberty and one of the Memorable Fancies), and a copy of \\"Our End is Come\\" preceding the text of MHH. You can read more details about Copy B of the MHH on the William Blake Archive website.Overall, well worth the price and a good purchase even if you already own the William Blake Trust's edition.

To speak in terms of religiosity, he had to use Christian terminology (Ezekial, Isiah, Satan...) because the language of religion was created this way, and Blake was forced to speak in those terms before developing his own language system.

Bert Monroy does some really amazing things in Photoshop (and Illustrator), and guides you step by step on how he did it. From creating window blinds to creating handles on a photo-realistic filling cabinet, this book is filled with great pictures and easy to read language many Photoshop users will find useful.(I should mention, though, that while you can create the great looking scenes Bert did in Photoshop, why would you want to? I mean, with 3D software so low in price today, you can get even more realistic graphics with a program such as Strata than you can with Photoshop. In MUCH less time. But Bert Monroy is an artist, and Photoshop is his tool, so this is more a practical thought on my end, and has no bearing on the quality of this book or the techniques applied therein.)The book itself is well written, though I particularly enjoyed the beginning of the book in which the reader gets a glimpse of Berts studio. I would die for a studio like that, let me tell you!Photoshop Studio is as much a picture book, as it is a written one. On almost every page is a picture of what he is writing about, how to do it, and all in clear color. (And the screen snapshots all show Bert is using Mac OS X!)Photoshop Studio is a class act. Well put together, well-written, and easy to follow. I enjoyed the time I spent with this book, and if you are into Photoshop, you will too.MacMice Rating: 5 out of 5..."},{"Title":"Photoshop Studio with Bert Monroy (Voices (New Riders))","review":"I bought my first Bert Monroy book, The Official Adobe Photoshop Handbook, back in 1991. Co-written with David Biedny, it was the bible for Photoshop version 2.0. Eleven years later, I have three Monroy titles on my bookshelf. Photorealistic Techniques with Photoshop and Illustrator (1999) which remains one of my all time favorites and now his latest, Photoshop Studio. Why do I find these books so valuable? Because the books are more than paper creations. They reflect insight and intellect. They are delivered in full color -- not just cold text -- and they offer the artist the proof that wonderful things can happen with the digitals tools now available. It is said that just knowing something is possible is half the battle of doing a difficult thing. Viewing Bert's examples lets you know that yes! it's possible and that you can go even further. More than just fancy pictures - there is information. Bert covers The Art of Brush Making, Lights and Shadows, Creating Textures, Reflections and more. As a working artist, I come to this book with expectations - and Monroy delivers. I recommend this book for the intermediate and advanced users of Photoshop 7. Beginners building a library of Photoshop resources would do well to add this to their shopping list."},{"Title":"Photoshop Studio with Bert Monroy (Voices (New Riders))","review":"I normally sell off older versions of books as I buy updated ones from the same authors since so much is repeated. With Bert Monroy that is NOT the case. If he wrote a book a week I would keep every one, but he would never do that unless he had something of substance to write about.This book not only gives fantastic examples of how to use advanced illustrative techniques in Photoshop 7 but also goes into Illustrator techniques. What makes Bert's writing so important is he shares the things that make his own work stand out, and he shares it with the reader in a fun and easy style.For instance, he suggests you always create paths in Illustrator. This gives you much more delicate and precise lines as opposed to the line tool in Photoshop which can never give you a line smaller then a pixel. Then, instead of placing or opening the path in Photoshop, he strongly recommends pasting between the two programs.Here he is passing on a lesson that is so simple yet so powerful it will change the look of your work from this point forward. That is just Mr. Monroy's style.Good luck in your future work, with this book by your side you will not need much luck though!Leslie"},{"Title":"Photoshop Studio with Bert Monroy (Voices (New Riders))","review":"Bert is a great artist and teacher. I took a class from him, and learned so much, but couldn't absorb it all at once.

His reputation for a graphics artist and teacher are well deserved. Wonderful examples, just enough detail to convey the point without beating you over the head.

If you are looking for blow by blow 'how to' for every feature, look at Photoshop CS Sudio Techniques, or the Adobe Class Room in a Book. I only wish this book had more samples, examples.

I searched extensively for the top three, basing my selection on the following criteria:1. Publish date > 1990. America of the 1950s is different from America of the 2000s. What readers want to read is different. You want the current dope. The newer, the better, the more relevant, in general.2. Recommendations from other writers. If no one cares enough to recommend a book, why bother?3. The writer offering advice should not be a talented freak, with literary genius, but no knack for teaching or relating to fellow mortals. The writer must come across as likable. Teaching calls on different skill sets than writing. Not every writer is cut out to be a teacher. How do you know who's likable and who's not? Google them, for one. Check their wikipedia entry, if any. Examine other published works.\\"Becoming Your Own Critique Partner,\\" by Walters & Toombs, is packed with advice, examples, and information, clearly and concisely explained. I recommend this along with Stephen King's \\"On Writing\\" and Nancy Kress's \\"Beginnings, Middles, and Ends.\\" These books aren't just for writers. A reader can become a more educated reader, a more knowledgeable critic, better able to explain his preferences.King's book, while immensely enjoyable and, to date, my favorite work by him, when it came to actual advice was rather thin. Also, his advice had a cranky tone, owing possibly to his injuries sustained prior to writing it. His book succeeds at being entertaining, but is not especially elucidating. He prefers to go for the punchline (which more often than not connects) rather than reinforce points he considers obvious. His life in itself is interesting and enlightening, however, and he has wisdom to impart of a higher level than technical mechanics. His stories about his life absolutely must not be missed. Recommended.Kress's book was excellent, but tends to focus on the big picture (namely, as her title says, \\"beginnings, middles, and ends\\"). She is mainly concerned with structure, plot, and scenes. Her examples are rather good. Recommended.\\"Becoming Your Own Critique Partner\\" delves deeply into the gory details. You want the gory details. The little things that mean a lot. Prose style. Not using adverbs, of course (all three books expound upon this cardinal rule), but much more. I found a better explanation of POV (Point of View) in this book than in either Kress's or King's. In fact, every lesson was explained better and more clearly here. This book also has more beef. The others are more on the thin side in regards to advice. Kress's and King's books can serve as needed reinforcements. If you have a team of teachers, that's usually better than just one. My plan is to read each of the three books several times."},{"Title":"Beginnings, Middles and Ends (Elements of Fiction Writing)","review":"Thi book is great for people who want to write a story.

The author has some good advice about the best way to start a story off on a strong foot, and helped me to see that a draft I'm currently working on should probably lose the first few scenes and start closer to the real action (the dropped scenes can be revealed as backstory through efficient use of character dialogue early on so the reader isn't confused).If you are looking for pointers on the actual craft of writing - how best to use adjectives, verbs, nouns; the best way to structure sentences and paragraphs; tips on making good use of metaphor and symbols, etc., then this is not the book for you. This book focuses exclusively on the overall structure of the story.It's also a fairly short book - 143 pages @ 6\\" x 9\\" with a moderately large font - but thankfully the author refrains from adding filler and sticks to the efficient dispensing of advise.I would recommend this book to any aspiring authors, particularly anyone who feels that their stories are turning into a quagmire halfway through the first draft, or who are having a hard time deciding the best place to begin."},{"Title":"Beginnings, Middles and Ends (Elements of Fiction Writing)","review":"So there I was, stuck in the dreaded middle of the first draft of my novel.

Almost a third of every page in this book is underlined: I thought the advice very important! And I still do. Although I don't reread this book on any regular basis, I still consult it when I feel the need to think about the structure of a novel. One of the points that Nancy Kress makes at the beginning is one too few writers of how-to-write books make: she talks about the implicit promise to the reader at the beginning of every book. It's an emotional promise about what kind of story the writer is offering and the reader will be reading. For a writer, it's important to understand that emotional promise, stay true to it, and deliver it. To a reader, it's important that a writer not deviate from this promise. I recently reviewed, on Amazon, \\"The Secret Garden,\\" which frustrated me and disappointed me because the author makes one implicit promise at the beginning of the book . . . and then changes horses in midstream, not delivering on that promise.This is a very good book, as good on the \\"middles\\" and \\"endings\\" as it is on \\"beginnings.\\""},{"Title":"Beginnings, Middles and Ends (Elements of Fiction Writing)","review":"I have read many instructional guides for writing fiction, and this is the best.

In a nutshell, the majority of these Elements are poor excuses for writing instruction. But Kress has made her mark, and this one will live long after WD has realized the weak links in its Elements series must be replaced. So ignore the other WD shortcomings, and the implications of the Beggars falterings, and you will be pleased to have purchased an indispensable volume for your reference shelf."},{"Title":"Fundamentalism","review":"Until reading this book I pretty much assumed fundamentalism (Christian, anyway) was mostly a U.S. phenomenon. Barr seems to be mostly occupied with British evangelicals. Actually, I was surprised at how *liberal* many of the evangelical/fundamentalist scholars he examines were by the standards of U.S. fundamentalists. For example, I imagine most garden variety U.S. fundies would be appalled that many of these scholars claim to be inerrantists and yet do not accept a literal six day creation and a young earth.Nevertheless, Barr does an excellent job of exposing the difficulties inherent in the concept of biblical inerrantism. The previous reviewer notes that many evangelical scholars also oppose the reflexive apologetic/harmonization stance espoused by the scholars Barr cites. That may be so, but if rank and file evangelicals/fundamentalists knew that these people were in their midst, they would run them out of town on the proverbial rail, or at the very least withdraw their support from the institutions that employ them."},{"Title":"Fundamentalism","review":"Barr was an outstanding theologian. His \\"Fundamentalism\\" has had and still has a major impact in evangelical and reformed circles. He analyses the trend in predominantly evangelical churches and demonstrates it as a different \\"religion.\\" The fundamentalist movement appeals to orthodox Christians but, according to Barr, is not a homegeneous and sound coherent view on Scriptures. The book is a \\"must\\" for all reformed theologians and pastors or ministers. The study is not an \\"easy read\\" at all and Barr's style tends to become too complex. Yet it is doubly worth the effort of investing time in mastering this profound and timeless work."},{"Title":"Fundamentalism","review":"I have been fairly impressed with some of James Barr's other works in different areas (eg. 'Semantics of Biblical Language') and I ventured into 'Fundamentalism' with an open mind, but was disappointed. By 'fundamentalist' he basically means most conservative evangelicals; his particular gripe is with the doctrine of inerrancy, though he levels plenty of other charges at conservatives: they don't believe non-fundamentalists are 'true' Christians; they only make use of critical scholarship when it suits their own agenda; they elevate their own traditions to infallible status. Of course all these have been true of some evangelicals at one point or another, but Barr makes all of these more or less blanket accusations that he wants to make out are an inherent part of conservative evangelicalism. He frequently draws attention to extreme examples that many (or most) thinking evangelical scholars would disown, eg. Harold Lindsell's infamous harmonisation of Peter's denial (which had him postulating a sixfold denial). He picks on Howard Marshall for harmonising the two ascension accounts in Luke and Acts, suggesting that this is typical of evangelical harmonisation whose only motivation is to protect the Bible from error, when in fact it is only common sense to assume that the SAME event recorded by the SAME author is more likely than not to be able to be harmonised. Barr's work is full of double standards: he despises the way conservatives, when asked by a layman about liberal theology, will be directed to a book written by a conservative intending to refute the liberal position, and yet Barr himself writes with the intent of introducing non-conservatives to HIS interpretation and refutation of fundamentalism; he complains about the animosity shown by some conservatives towards biblical scholars, and yet his own work is marred by a hostile and unfriendly attitude. In fact, if it weren't for the blatant hostility demonstrated towards conservative evangelicalism throughout the book, and the fact that every accusation he raises he tries to elevate to 'typical' status within 'fundamentalism', he might actually have some good points to make. He doesn't seem to realise, however, that many of these criticisms have been raised WITHIN evangelicalism, by people who hold firmly to inerrancy, which Barr seems to see as the Achilles' heel of evangelicalism. Barr thinks that evangelicals have been wrong to reject biblical criticism? Good! Many evangelicals say the same thing, and it is only one narrow stream of evangelicalism who have rejected it outright, whereas many conservative scholars have used biblical criticism honestly and responsibly. Barr is fed up with crass harmonisations and ludicrous attempts to explain away 'errors'? Good! Many evangelical scholars are equally fed up, yet they remain inerrantists. Barr is tired of partisan propaganda from fundamentalists, of their failure to interact sufficiently with non-conservative scholarship, of being uncreative in theology and unwilling to step out into new territory? Good! Join the rest of the world of evangelical scholarship who have been raising the same objections for many years, from within a Bible-believing, inerrantist framework. Barr would like his readers to think that all the problems he finds in conservative evangelicalism are as a direct result of holding to inerrancy, but the evidence is against him. I have recently done my BA thesis on Barr's criticisms, particularly as they relate to inerrancy and interpretation, and I have come across many evangelical scholars who share Barr's concerns, and yet feel no need to abandon inerrancy (Craig L. Blomberg and Moises Silva were those who impressed me most). I found 'Fundamentalism' misleading and, in fact, almost vicious at times. I had to restrain my anger just to be able to learn from Barr's criticisms, because the underlying tone completely obscured any positive contributions Barr might have had to make. Barr is generally a good scholar, but he went beyond the bounds of good scholarship this time, and 'Fundamentalism' is more akin to the 'rubbishy partisan literature' he so despises than any fair, academic treatment of a subject which deserves attention."},{"Title":"The Founding Fathers and the Place of Religion in America","review":"This book is the best on its subject which I have come across in a very long time -- after a fairly long course of reading books on US church-state relations over the years -- in history, law, policy...I came to Lambert now after wading through a score or so of recent books on this -- tracts, I'll call most of the others, because they were nearly all horribly-biased. This has been part of a personal project to explain, and defend, the extraordinary depth and richness of US religiosity to some overseas friends. Foreigners never do understand how we can have such strong religious activity and belief, here in the US, while at the same time we maintain a \\"wall of separation\\" between church and state.Lambert does an admirable job of explaining this -- and he does it fairly, with great balance, and with wonderful style in his writing. He has a point of view himself, but he does not let it become a bias -- anyone possessing any of the many opinions which exist, on these issues, can get much out of reading this book.Lambert is a master of the topical and well-timed historical anecdote: he weaves these together, gently, in an entertaining and informative account of the US Colonial record on the difficulties of accommodating \\"varieties of religious experience\\". But he also has a keen historian's eye for the value of generalizations. He confines his text very carefully to his chosen historical period, 1600-1800. But he is not at all afraid to draw out a universal theme, occasionally, from his account of what those little bands of English expatriates and descendants of same were doing, or thought they were doing, back then in their \\"13 colonies\\".So we get the intriguing suggestion that the world -- or at least the Western European and particularly the New World American British Colonies part of it, but not just that last -- was proceeding, during that period, from a religious politics dominated by the clergy to one governed by the individual -- and perhaps that, more than quarrels over belief, is what the fuss was all about... \\"The central question for the Founders had not been religion's role,\\" he asserts, \\"Rather, they worried about religion's place, deciding in the end that it would fluorish more through persuasion... than through government coercion.\\" (p. 206)And, along the same lines, Lambert gives us the suggestion -- this one heard in the French Revolution as well -- that more than a matter of doctrine the religious changes of the times were political, again, and more of a shift in power from Ministers to Lawyers -- \\"Lawyers, not clergymen, took the lead in challenging Parliament's new imperial policies...\\" (p. 210). So the US Revolution certainly changed US politics, but unlike the French the US Americans still were free, afterward, to believe whatever they wanted to believe in matters of religion.Lambert's \\"Introduction\\" ought to be mandatory reading for anyone interested in current issues in these areas. As already mentioned, the body of the book is devoted to careful, balanced, US Colonial history: interesting stories, intriguingly presented, but meticulously crafted so as not to become the sweeping over-generalizations and \\"moral lessons\\" so often presented in other literature on this subject. In his Introduction, however, Lambert is not afraid to take a shot at characterizing current controversies: and it is a very careful and balanced and complete one --\\"This study looks at the cultural and political boundaries that circumscribed the Founders' decisions and actions,\\" he warns in his Introduction (p. 8) -- his implication, at least, being that passionate controversies today have their \\"contexts\\" as well...\\"During the last two decades of the twentieth century and continuing into the twenty-first, Americans have engaged in a culture war... On one side of the debate are those who insist that America has been since its conception a 'Christian Nation'... They blame 'liberals' for not only turning their backs on the country's religious heritage but openly attaching those who embrace 'traditional' Christian values... these conservatives often conflate the planters -- such as the New England Puritans and the Chesapeake Anglicans -- and the Founders into one set of forefathers...\\", Lambert says.But in addition, \\"Partisans on the other side of the culture war also consult the nation's Founders for a 'usable past' of their own. They, too, tend to conflate the two sets of progenitors by making both the Founding and the Planting Fathers impassioned champions of a religious freedom that extended liberty of conscience to all...\\"The book presents a really interesting controversy, then: good history, and also invaluable ammunition for both sides in the current fight, hopefully for use in moderating their own extremist positions and coming to a better understanding -- an understanding of the necessities for change, if those exist, but also of the reasons for maintaining continuity, as those do too.In a time of White House \\"faith-based initiatives\\", and of Department of Justice \\"Moslem\\" roundups, and of Supreme Courts which grant certiorari to \\"Under God\\" cases, Lambert's book should be required reading -- not just for religion classes, but also for history classes and law classes and decision-makers, and for all members of the general public... who either do or do not love the US... There is a great deal of wisdom about what makes the US a strong and good place, in this book.Jack Kessler..."},{"Title":"The Founding Fathers and the Place of Religion in America","review":"This very good book is a concise history of church-state relations in Colonial and Revolutionary America from the early British settlements to the election of 1800. Lambert describes the nature of early religous establishments, the increasing diversification of American religion, the impact of the Enlightenment and radical Whig ideology, and the emergence of church-state separation after the Revolution. There will be little new in this book for scholars of this period but this is definitely the best overview I have seen on this very contentious topic. Aimed at a broad audience, The Founding Fathers is written well, organized well, and is objective.Lambert comes to this subject from an interesting perspective. His prior major work has been on the history of 18th century evangelism and his is an expert on Colonial religous practice. He particularly stresses that most of the colonies were founded originally with established churches and that establishment crumbled under the pressures of religous diversification. By the mid-18th century, the colonies contained a remarkably diverse set of Protestant sects and even some Catholics. This religous diversity, some of which arose from immigration and some from separatist movements within established churches, placed great strains on established churches. The mid-century Great Awakening resulted in further diversification and undermined the authority of the parish system throughout the colonies. Around the same time, the Enlightenment, with its Deistic views, and radical Whig ideology, with its emphasis on individual liberty, were becoming increasingly influential in the Colonies. All these factors converged to form a widespread belief that individuals, not the state, should determine religous faith. Individual churches would have to compete for adherents in a marketplace of ideas without the support of the state. These ideas eventually culminated in the post-Revolutionary separation of Church and State in the Federal Constitution. Separationism was supported most strongly by a coalition of relatively secular political leaders, like most of the Founders, and Protestant dissenters whose churches had suffered discrimination under the established churches in several colonies. This coalition believed correctly that religion was best served by being separated from the state. This was truly a revolutionary development and the USA was the first polity to enact church-state separation. Indeed, a number of European states still have established churches and almost all of them preserve a constitutionally sanctioned special relationship with one church. Lambert concludes by discussing the Presidential election of 1800, which some Federalists and sectarians framed as a referendum on Jefferson's unfitness to be President because of his deist-unitarian beliefs. Lambert argues convincingly that the election of 1800 acted as a referendum of sorts not just on Jefferson but also on church-state separation. Perhaps the only significant defect of this book is that the conclusion leaves one with the impression that the Church-State separation was settled after the election of 1800. It was not, and some of the more unattractive subsequent aspects of our history are consequences of imperfect separation. The Federal separation of Church and State applied originally only to the actions of the Federal government, some states continued with established churches into the 19th century. More important, state and local political power became vehicles for religous bigotry, notably abuse of public school systems in ways that infringed the rights of minority religions. One of the reasons we have a large system of Catholic private education is that 19th century Protestants used public schools to harass Catholics. Lambert demonstrates nicely that separation was engendered by the religous diversity of 18th century America. We have even more religous diversity today and separation continues to be a guarantee of a vibrant religous culture.The issue of Church-State separation continues to be very contentious. Since many partisans in this debate appeal to the Revolutionary period to support their points of view, writing in this field can be emotionally charged. Lambert has clearly written this book in an effort to provide a fair and dispassionate presentation of what actually happened. Reflecting a broad consensus of knowledgeable historians, he has succeeded, though his conclusions will not be palatable for many on the religous right."},{"Title":"The Founding Fathers and the Place of Religion in America","review":"I have to agree with the other reviewers here (like Jack Kessler below):This is a book that should be read by BOTH pro-separationists and anti-separationists. Of all the books that I have read on the subject, this book was *refreshingly* honest, accurate and scholarly, not to mention, a rather enjoyable reading.The author stays clear of attacking either pro-separationists or anti-separationists--I truly appreciated that. (Can I assume this man is a Christian, or at least a good man?) Its been awhile since I've read a book on this subject that was historically accurate and could be trusted because it does not come across as biased.Even if I agreed with him for the most part, the author forced me to think about my own stance. As another reviewer stated, this man also addresses the issues and policies that are being debated about around the first amendment, some of which I did not understand as clearly until I read this book.As the other reviewer here said, this book should be a *textbook* for everyone, because it shows some of the history that many of us Christians (on both ends of spectrum) don't know about.The book even gave me a greater respect for our nation's founders, after learning about the issues they grappled with.Of ALL the books on the subject, this is my favorite, and probably the only book that I would recommend as a MUST READ for people at both ends of the political spectrum! :)"},{"Title":"The Founding Fathers and the Place of Religion in America","review":"Frank Lambert, professor of history at Purdue University, does an excellent job of surveying this complex topic over a 200-year period. He does so thoroughly, yet concisely, in only 296 pages. While making generalizations at times, he often illustrates his points with quotations from original sources of the time period.He begins by criticizing extremists on both sides of the issue, and proceeds to present a balanced approach. However, as I will explain at the end of this review, he shows his bias at the end.Lambert's thesis is this: America WAS first settled by people who wanted to make it a Christian nation, whether Puritans in New England, Anglicans in Virginia, or Quakers and others in Pennsylvania. These early founders had a vision of making America \\"a city on a hill,\\" a model Christian commonwealth. However, two major influences led the founding fathers to establish a government that separated church and state. These two influences were the Enlightenment and the Great Awakening. Men like Thomas Jefferson and Thomas Paine, who were influenced by the Enlightenment, felt that men should be free to use their own reason in matters of religion. The Baptists and others who benefitted from the rapid growth of \\"free\\" churches in the Great Awakening were persecuted by established churches and wished to have no established church, so they joined with men like Jefferson in calling for separation of church and state.Lambert shows that there was great division over these issues, and gives interesting anecdotes and quotations from both sides. He quotes frequently from religious leaders on both sides of the issue. However, near the end of the book he spends much more time quoting Republicans like Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, and gives little space to Federalists like George Washington and John Adams. At one point, on page 161, Lambert implies that John Adams was a deist, even though biographies of Adams have shown him to be a devout Christian with a Puritan heritage.Lambert shows his view in his conclusion, as he criticizes accomodationists such as Judge William Rehnquist and \\"religious right\\" preachers like Pat Robertson.While Lambert gives both sides of the argument, he clearly leads the reader to his own separationist interpretation. Because the book is so full of useful information, I highly recommend it as a textbook on the subject, but let the reader understand that Lambert has his own bias, too."},{"Title":"The Founding Fathers and the Place of Religion in America","review":"Lambert offers a rare erudite examination of the issue of religion at the founding of our nation. Given the heated partisan rhetoric coming from all sides in this debate, it is refreshing to hear a voice of moderation.Although Lambert offers a compelling case for a secular government and pluralistic religious culture, such an argument, although cogent, may obscure an underlying problem among those who look to the past for direction on present-day policy: That which \\"was\\" is not necessarily \\"as should be.\\"Consider this: Our founders tolerated slavery; the subjugation of women in the spheres of education, occupation, and politics; legal disregard for the Native peoples, whose legal definition was left ambiguous, etc.Is it not safe to assume that we have become a different society and culture since the late eighteenth century? Therefore, even IF the \\"Christian-nation\\" pseudo-historians could convincingly make their case, it does not follow that America SHOULD be a Christian nation today any more than we would conclude that slavery or disenfranchisement of women and blacks are acceptable features of our culture.In the end, my response would be, \\"So what?\\" I have no antiquarian reactionary neuroses that compel me to embrace the ideas of past generations. Indeed, it is the lack of a compelling message that forces evangelicals to cherry-pick history to buttress their unpersuasive arguments.Having said that, Lambert's book should be applauded for successfully undermining the simplistic, quote-mining, de-contextualizing, de-historicizing pretensions of fundamentalist revisionists who ransack history in search of only \\"useful\\" evidence."},{"Title":"The Founding Fathers and the Place of Religion in America","review":"Lambert's book is not bombastic or partisan. He demolishes cherished myths with subtlety and nuance. One in particular is this persistent notion that the Puritans founded this nation, and we can thus look to them for guidance as to our proper trajectory. Such \\"School House Rock\\" views of history distort reality, and encourage ill-begotten movements like the \\"Christian-Nation\\" movement. By the Puritans' own assessments, the theocratic communal vision of the \\"City on a Hill\\" failed within the second generation. Regardless, the truth is that the Puritans were but a tiny stream (and not the first) that eventually combined with many other streams to form a mighty river at the point of the Founding. It is in this environment that the Founders had to deal with religion. They chose to make it a personal matter, mainly because of the diversity already present among the people. They chose not to emulate certain state constitutions with established churches. One must ask why. As one reviewer put it we may have been a \\"Christian Nation\\" in the sense that the majority of the population identified with some form or flavor of that faith, but we were self-consciously established as a \\"Secular state.\\" This is a fine, but necessary, distinction as partisans call for a return to an imagined and longed-for past. Lambert makes this distinction with cogency and grace."},{"Title":"The Founding Fathers and the Place of Religion in America","review":"Lambert's book provides a valuable overview of sectarian strife in early America. His examination of Adams' view of church-state relations was especially helpful.In the intro, though, he claims to be writing a book that takes the middle road on church-state relations. Previous reviewers proved themselves highly suggestible readers in this regard, as his view of the Founders take on church and state is decidedly imbalanced. If you're going to write a book focusing on the Founders' two most vociferous separationists, at least present some truth in advertising.* Lambert spends 70 pages on Jefferson and Adams and a mere 16 on Washington and Hamilton. Any coincidence that the former two were vociferous separationists, while the latter two were integrationists?* Lambert doesn't once mention Washington's farewell address. Such an omission in a book on church-state relations defies comprehension, until you see that Lambert's agenda, contra claims, is to buttress contemporary support for a complete separation between government and religion.* Lambert fails to apply the common distinction between state-established religion and civic religion to the modern debate.* Instead, he finishes the book by providing a damning quote from Jerry Falwell and proceding to refute the televangelist. And again, in an omission that reveals his barely concealed agenda, Lambert provides no similar quote-and-refutation regarding today's separation absolutists. The implication in the Falwell quote is that integrationists are mostly establishmentarians rather than civic religionists.Consider this book a useful supplement on certain aspects of the church-state issue in early America, especially on the importance of sectarian divisions. But don't buy the neutrality nonsense he offers in the intro. As happens with most professors today, Lambert's worldview so thoroughly dominates his profession that it can't help but emerge through even the most determined efforts to remain objective."},{"Title":"The Founding Fathers and the Place of Religion in America","review":"What a well-balanced review of how religion started in the colonies. I believe this is a fair assessment although it contradicts an anti-religious &amp; pro-religious viewpoint. I am a christian and was surprised to learn the religious community's attempt to oppose Thomas Jefferson's election to President in 1800. In fact, based upon what you hear from the religious right, all our Founding Fathers were christians and never considered a separation of church and state. This text, as I noted earlier, contradicts this notion.Being a christian I would prefer a christian president but no litmus test was established so the Founding Fathers must not have thought it to be critical for the new republic. What was also interesting was the fact the northern states were more religiously conservative than the southern states (the fight to keep Jefferson from the White House came from preachers in the north). Based upon other texts I have read, it appears the south became a more religiously conservative haven after the civil war.The only minor dissapointment with the book was that I wanted the author to address the current church/state issues such as having the ten commandments in the courtroom and prayer in public schools. I of course support the prayer and ten commandment issues. The author could have addressed whether the Foundng Fathers would have supported these notions also. The author could have at least took a position on what the Founders would have wanted. He did indicate whether the favorable tax status of religious institutions violated the 1st ammendment. Again, the text provided a fair protrayal of the environment in our early years but could have done more to project what the Founders would have done today, in today's environment, with the current church/state issues."},{"Title":"1500 feet over Vietnam: A marine helicopter pilot's diary","review":"Bruce Lake's 1500 FEET OVER VIETNAM: A MARINE HELICOPTER PILOT'S DIARY is an excellent first-person narrative dealing with what it was like to be a Marine combat aviator in Vietnam. He has an understated writing style that manages to keep the reader involved with each chapter.This reviewer conversed at length by phone with Bruce on a number of occasions awhile back while doing some project research on 1st Lt. Horace H. Fleming, USMC, who is still listen as a POW/MIA. Lt. Fleming, known to his fellow Marines as \\"Bud,\\" was the pilot of a Marine CH-46A helicopter that was bringing reinforcements into the compound of Ngok Tavak, about five miles away from the border outpost at Kham Duc, in Vietnam. Ngok Tavak had been attacked by elements of the NVA 2nd Regiment in the early morning hours of 10 May 1968, and by the time the two CH-46s arrived, the camp was undergoing heavy rocket, mortar, and infantry attack.As Lt. Fleming lifted off, his aircraft was hit by enemy anti-aircraft fire, severing either the fuel or oil line, forcing him to land his aircraft within the besieged compound. As a second aircraft, a UH-1 Huey, hovered over the fouled landing pad in order to take on wounded. Fleming and some Nung soldiers mounted the skids but were unable to enter the crowded cabin. After the aircraft lifted off, Fleming and the Nung soldiers fell over 100 feet into the thick jungle outside of the defensive perimeter that was controlled by the NVA.The Ngok Tavak defenders withdrew to the base camp at Kham Duc, arriving just in time to fight in the unsuccessful defense of that camp. Lt. Fleming was one of at least 39 Americans who died or was taken prisoner during the defeats at Ngok Tavak and Kham Duc, and one of the 32 whose possible remains have not been repatriated. Bud Fleming was promoted to Captain, then to Major over the years, but his status is still unknown.Bruce Lake and Bud Fleming were fellow Marine CH-46A pilots, both members of HMM-265, a Marine Medium Helicopter squadron that was with MAG-16 at MMAF. If you read this book you will find Lt. Fleming mentioned as \\"Bud.\\"The author offers a great deal of insight about what it was like to be \\"Up North\\" flying daily helicopter missions in what was some of the most hotly-contested territory of the entire Vietnam Conflict. 1500 FEET OVER VIETNAM is one of those books that's hard to put down once you start reading.The author also describes what it was like to come home to New England after his tour of duty; a young combat pilot who had seen far more than most civilians could imagine from the daily news coverage that was being displayed in the media.It's not difficult to imagine what it was like flying from the way that the author relates his experiences there. Though frequently understated, the images of what Bruce and others experienced can be shared by reading this superb recollection of just one part of the Vietnam conflict.This reviewer has a personal interest in this book, as I still wear a POW/MIA bracelet that bears the inscription \\"MAJ HORACE H. FLEMING, III, USMC - 10 MAY 68 SVN.\\" It's my third bracelet with his name since the 1970s.Thanks, Bruce, from one 'Nam-Era Marine to another. It's a superb read. Semper Fi!"},{"Title":"1500 feet over Vietnam: A marine helicopter pilot's diary","review":"I know Bruce Lake, and like him, flew helicopters in Vietnam. He was with the Marines \\"up north,\\" and I was in the Delta--as an Army aviator with the 175th Outlaws. Vinh Long was a great place to be stationed, and I missed out on many of the experiences Bruce writes about because of that. We were in considerable high contrast to many of the Army aviators' tours from my flight school class of 66-14, too. Bruce tells what it was like to fly the CH 46, the standard tandem rotorcraft of the Marines in this war, as we flew Huey slicks and gunships in our branch of service. I highly recommend this book by my friend, who self-published as I did, and has now nearly sold out all he printed. Keep-a-going, Bruce!"},{"Title":"1500 feet over Vietnam: A marine helicopter pilot's diary","review":"I flew as a navy corpsman in USMC helicopters at the same time Bruce was a pilot. I may have flown with him, hard to tell anymore. I met Bruce a few years back and was impressed with his sincerity and warmth. His book occupies an important part of my bookshelf and I frequently turn to it. Bruce said things I wish I could have said. This is a great book full of truths. If you are a Vietnam veteran you need to read this book: if you are not a veteran, you need to read this book also to try and understand the sacrifices made on your behalf by brave aviators who climbed into the cockpits and cabins of rickety helicopters that should never have been flown in combat. Read this book."},{"Title":"1500 feet over Vietnam: A marine helicopter pilot's diary","review":"In reviewing Bruce Lake's Book, \\"1500 Feet Over Vietnam,\\" it is rare that an author can be so nonchalant and modest to the fact that he had earned the \\"Silver Star\\" and 42 air medals as a young Marine helicopter pilot. However, when Mr. Lake wrote this book, it was never intended for publication. This entire memoir is based on letters that started on April 1, 1968 and concluded on April 20th, 1969, all to his wife in an attempt to describe his missions and what everyday life was like in his Vietnam \\"chariot\\" i.e. the helicopter. Self published, and without the distortion of time (writing a memoir 40 years later from memory), Lake recounts the pain of close friends dying way before their time in combat and crashes, braving enemy fire for troop insertions, extractions and medical dust offs.Mr. Lake goes farther then that. After leaving the service after 5 years, he would feel embarrassed to tell people at his college campus (often five years younger then him and experiencing their first freedom from home) that he had been to Vietnam. Vietnam had done strange things to \\"his head.\\" After seeing hundreds of dead and dying people in Vietnam, not to mention flying 840 combat missions in 11 months and surviving helicopter crashes and countless near misses, Lake began to both \\"think\\" he was immortal and \\"knew\\" he was addicted to the adrenalin the previously mentioned would generate. The reader will understand why Lake grew his hair long, bought a high powered motorcycle and drove it at reckless speeds and while working at a factory he would go to the 5th floor and stand with his toes over the edge of the roof and stare at the ground; all in a fruitless attempt to unsuccessfully recreate the surge of excitement that could only come from bringing a chopper into a hot landing zone while surrounding N.V.A. muzzle flashes were aimed right at him spewing forth hot lead.The letters that made up this book were put away for 8 years, and Vietnam receded in the author's mind. Then, after a Navy Reservist and ex \\"Air America\\" pilot who lost a relative in 1968 asked Lake if he had been involved in the medical evacuation of his nephew's unit, Lake collected his feelings and with encouragement from friends and family started to chronologically arrange and read them. The result of that effort comprises this wonderful book. Bruce Lake does a fantastic job of explaining his part of flying in a new military concept introduced in Vietnam that was called \\"Heliborne Warfare\\". Depending on weather conditions, Lake's primary job was to transport supplies, cargo, or most importantly 20 fully armed U.S. troops into battle flying his \\"A\\" model CH-46 helicopter as part of \\"Marine Medium Helicopter Squadron 265\\" (HMM-265)Lake was also quick to point out that even though between missions he went to the beach, slept in comfortable quarters, went to the air conditioned Officer's Club, he faced constant issues such as; \\"Why did a certain pilot get hit? Whose turn would it be next time? How soon will we lose another pilot? When will it be my turn to die?\\" Lake includes stories in this memoir that are rare, informing, and will never reach any history text. When delivering $30,000 in cash as a payroll officer, Lake tells the reader the security of a cartridge belt and pistol would bring him. Another interesting anecdote was when Lake recalled learning in grade school how people during the U.S. Civil War would pack lunches and bring their family in wagons to watch battles in fields in valleys. Lake wondered how different it was to fly into and out of pitched battles for seven hours and then return to the base, go to the beach and check out a sailboat and sail up and down the coast watching other people fight.Ruminating on the course of the war, Lake reflected; \\"I had been in Vietnam less than 2 weeks and already I was beginning to think we weren't really over here to win a war. We were there for economic reasons more than democratic reasons.\\" Lake also pointed out that despite the heavy attrition and heavy \\"body counts\\" of the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong, where the enemy was getting killed more than 100 to 1, superior U.S. weaponry (the awesome fire power of \\"Puff the Magic Dragon\\" (a transport plane, usually a \\"C-47\\" armed with \\"Gattling Guns\\" that could rain down a covering fire for U.S. ground troops of 15,000 rounds per minute!) and the devastation of a B-52 air strike, the U.S. was still not winning the war, with (to use the famous cliche) \\"no light at the end of the tunnel.\\" Lake shamefully admitted that he worked with pilots who were too cowardly or scared to fly into \\"hot\\" landing zones. Similar to the problem with American ground troops fragging their overzealous superior officers, these sneaky pilots would pull circuit breakers to simulate mechanical failure to get out of dangerous missions.Also mentioned was the scarcity of territory the U.S. truly \\"controlled\\" in Vietnam, the problem of enemy tunnels all over the South (particularly in and around \\"Cu Chi\\")and how units of the South Vietnamese Army (A.R.V.N.) were composed of soldiers that in some cases were 12 years old or younger! The hardest letter Lake wrote to his wife was the story of his aversion to \\"Wrigley's Juicy Fruit Gum,\\" which he still has today. There were missions Lake flew where he had to bring back many badly decomposed bodies of Marines killed in action. To mask the horrible stench of death, Lake would keep a pack of gum in the sleeve of his flight suit. To mask the odor, he would chew a few pieces and stick the moist gum to his upper lip just below his nose to mask the odor! How many 18 year old's that Lake later went to college with after Vietnam had to deal with this? Lake ends this incredible memoir with his experiences in Japan at the end of his tour and the anti-war sentiment he ran into upon his return to the States. There are so many more anecdotes about the intricacies of this sad chapter in American history, that the serious student of the Vietnam War simply MUST READ this book!"},{"Title":"Read Me Another Story","review":"The book is a collection of short stories and poems for children, written years ago obviously, but whose themes are relatively untouched by time.Many of the stories deal with issues common to children of a certain age, using language they can relate to and without being too heavy-handed with the teachable moments. The cumulative effect reminds me a bit of Mr. Rogers. One story deals with the too-small-for-this, too-big-for-that moments in childhood, another with moving and the process of becoming accustomed to a new place and all the change in routine that involves. Others talk about everyday things, like taking baths, the feel of new shoes, the comfort of old ones, learning to whistle, and the delightful squishiness of mud. Poems interspersed with the stories keep the pacing of the collection interesting while exposing your child to the idea that poems can be very short-just enough to capture a fleet-footed thought, or long enough to tell a whole story.Scattered throughout the book are simple black and white illustrations, comforting and nostalgic all at once.(Excerpted from a much longer review on my book blog, [...].

Oddly enough, they are not fertility figures. Most of them are portrayed as ferocious and gaunt, with the ribs clearly delineated. Here is one of the earliest references to a Sheela found at Barnahealy, County Cork: \\"This is one of those old Fetish figures often found in Ireland on the fronts of churches as well as castles, they are called 'Hags of the Castle' and when placed above the keystone of the door arch were supposed to possess a tutelary or protective power so that an enemy passing by would be disarmed of evil intent against the building on seeing it.\\"Typically in Gaelic oral traditions, a central character in many of the stories was a fearsome female figure, typically described as \\"an old woman with a bald head, cadaverous ribs, sagging abdomen, and small flat breasts.\\" She is the crone, the third aspect of the Earth goddess which also includes a maiden and a woman in her sexual prime.It is rather delightful to think that the Sheela-na-Gigs migrated from Celtic mythology into Christian iconography and could be found perched above many a monastery or church door where generations of monks filed under her, protected (although they may not have known it) from the evil eye by an exaggerated carving of female pudenda. It's a pity that more recent churchmen (especially since the Reformation and most especially since Victorian times) were more prudish than their early counterparts and destroyed or hid many of these Sheelas.This book contains drawings of all known Sheela-na-Gigs of Ireland and Britain, and also figures that might be related to them. The authors also list a website where further research on Sheela-Na-Gigs is being published: jharding.demon.co.uk.You might want to plan your next trip to Britain or Ireland to include viewings of these fascinating, archaic Divine Hags."},{"Title":"Sheela-na-Gigs of Ireland and Britain: The Divine Hag of the Christian Celts - An Illustrated Guide","review":"I have had a fascination with Sheela Na Gigs for a long time, but to be honest my knowledge on her was scant. I have worked with her as a personal deity for about 8 years (when she first appeared to me), so I had some idea of how I viewed her, but this book has refreshed my connection with Sheela to a profound level.This book puts fowards some very interesting ideas as to the origins of the Sheelas &amp; her name, and her possible basis in the hag aspect, which is the type of energy that I myself have found her to have. I have also gleaned some new ideas as to possible symbolic interpretations of her physical appearance, which has set me off on new avenuse of thinking.The end of the book has a catalogue of Sheelas in England, Ireland, Wales &amp; Scotland, and each entry has sketches of them. With this book in hand I have been to see two of them, one in Oxford &amp; another in Fiddington. There is a Sheela about 20 minutes from my house and that will be my next visit!This pictorial catalogue is extremely useful in that it allows you to see the particular Sheela refferred to in the main body of the text, thus enabling you to make up your own mind as to whether it supports the claims or not.I must say it's a great shame I'm the first person to write a review of this book, I just wish there were as many people interested in Sheelas &amp; their origins as Green Men, because to be honest Sheela is far more interesting!"},{"Title":"Sheela-na-Gigs of Ireland and Britain: The Divine Hag of the Christian Celts - An Illustrated Guide","review":"During a vacation in Ireland I stumbled across this book.

They can be found on castles and in museums. But the majority of these figures occur in small country churches; the oldest of them dating around 1200 AD.This book is an easy and most interesting read and puts forward some interesting theories on the figures' origins.

It deserves a place along side the very best leadership books of today, even Douglas McGregor's The Human Side of Enterprise or John Gardner's On Leadership. In short, Tead finds the words to describe the very highest aspirations of leaders. Tead is a true believer that leadership (to paraphrase FDR) is a moral cause. To summarize the book, Tead argues that character and values do matter in leadership. As far as the book's age (it was published in 1935), I would say that the last third of the book (where Tead deals with sexual politics in the workplace) shows the greatest signs of being outdated. But the rest of this book is terrific and deserves a place in anyone's leadership library.

Thirdly, the book reads like a high school term paper. There is little if any substance found in this book. I knew relatively nothing about how to sell bio tech products before reading the book, and I basically know very little after reading this book. The author claims that this book \\"leaves no stone unturned\\" yet the book only touches superficially on a few topics. The book is chock full of useless information. For example, one of my favorite parts of the book is on the last page, in the chapter titled \\"Knowledge of Territory\\", under the subheading of \\"Offer Assistance\\" where the author says,\\"When you make calls on customers, go the extra mile and offer assistance. Ask your customers, \`is there anything else I can answer for you?' Look for opportunities here, \\"I happened to hear your receptionist say that the printer needs a new toner cartridge, would you like me to pick up one for you?'\\"I am not kidding you.

Tucker was a man who after dedicating his life to Christ at 17 spent his time doing the work of God. Simply by reading author Frederick Cuthbertson's heartfelt words and descriptions of Bishop Tucker it becomes abundantly clear that he had a tremendous impact on the lives of those he came in contact with. This book includes a brief biography of Bishop Tucker, but the true depth of the book comes from the collection of over 150 of his sayings. While Bishop Tucker may not have originated all of the sayings, he applied his wisdom and Biblical knowledge to the context in which they were used. The book lists the various sayings, includes a brief description of the context in which they were used and citations of Biblical references which relate to the sayings. For example the saying \\"Rake the word to yourself and don't use a shovel\\" suggests that the word of God is meant for our hearts and not meant to be cast away when it condemns us for our misdeeds.With the well over 150 sayings included in this book, there is advice that is relevant to any person at any given point in their lives. More importantly, the book's easy to remember sayings, when taken to heart, will help any Christian walk closer to God. The only disappointment about this book was it's organization, it would have been a much more powerful day to day resource for Christians had the various sayings been organized by theme so that they are easier to locate. Still The \\"Sayings\\" of the Late Bishop William W. Tucker is both inspirational and motivational.Reviewed by Stacey Seay"},{"Title":"Galactic Geographic Annual 3003: Earth Edition","review":"This is a stunningly beautiful and mind-expanding foray into speculation about life on other worlds, packaged as a remarkable artifact. Imagine having your friends drop by and notice this interesting book on your table, that turns out to be a coffee-table book from the future! An absolute treat!The Galactic Geographic series originally ran in Heavy Metal magazine years ago, and is currently running there again. It was created by my favorite off-world artist, Karl Kofoed, who paints images of alien worlds so dynamic and tactile that you can only assume they were painted on location!Don't pass this one up!"},{"Title":"Galactic Geographic Annual 3003: Earth Edition","review":"The sheer momentum of the author's imagination and consummate skill in delivering the visual evidence was a big surprise.

For those that love _real_ science fiction, I recommend this book."},{"Title":"The meaning of icons,","review":"Among the many books on icons, this is one of the oldest still in print. Why has it become a classic? Because it was written by one of the greatest twentieth century theologians, Vladimir Lossky, and by one of the greatest 20th century iconographers,Leonide Ouspensky who spent the whole of his artistic life in France painting icons and frescoes. Their approach is unique not only because of their deep experience of the Orthodox faith, but also because of the way they decided to describe the colour prints reproduced in this volume. What we have here is a superb commentary in the form of selection of poetry from the feasts during which these icons are placed in the middle of the church. Much of this Byzantine hymnography has no parallel in the West. It is what is heard in the eastern Christian church throughout the liturgical year which this volume beautifully illustrates both in word and image. The authors' feeling for the uplifting prayer of which icons play such a vital part is genuine and rarely found in any other book about the iconographic tradition. All Christians and many non-Christians will appreciate their respectful presentation of the revelation of God to man as it is presented in this book."},{"Title":"The meaning of icons,","review":"About icons and their meaning I already had (and read) a lot in the Russian language, but until now I didn't have content and illustrations in one hand. That's for me the meaning of the Meaning. It is short, gives the theological and canonical information about the role of the icon in Eastern Orthodoxy from inside, the themes are worked out and clearly arranged, the illustrations are big and beautyful. So, I am very glad that I sought for it and bought it."},{"Title":"The meaning of icons,","review":"This book invites readers with and without knowledge of icons. Its size, method, and delivery resemble art books at twice the cost. Initial publication date in 1952 occurred when both authors had achieved mature productivity as icon writer (Ouspensky) and theologian (Lossky) while ex-patriots in Paris. Sampling of Russian icons in this text from the 16th-century forward revealed many treasures of late Byzantium reinterpreted by Christian faith in Russia. Many of these icons might have been erased by time or ideologues had the authors' combined experience and memory not captured them here.But the book is more than archeological artifact. It cannot be dismissed as a preservationist project. Rather, faith and icon extend a splendid view of the new world transformed by the likeness of the heavenly Creator. Spectacular views of the new world await in what I consider a master-text by Ouspensky and Lossky."},{"Title":"The meaning of icons,","review":"This is a book every icon painter should have on her bookshelf.

It covers information about formation of the island and the colonization of the island in a simple written manner. I also like the way it divides the book into 11 chapters and adds something about the poetic Edda at the start of each chapter to relay how mythology interplays with realistic events like the formation of such an island. But as an adult reader, I still had more questions after I finished the book.The book does not go in depth about the geological nature of the island. Yes, the island was formed from a volcanic eruption, but what is the nature and quality of the land? Will it be settled by Man as it has been by birds and plant-life? What is the future of such an island? (The book implies at the end that it will be destroyed, but does not tell the reader the specifics of how/when/why). I was looking to answer such questions more in depth about this new island.The stength of this book lies in its remarkable pictures. If only you could get some of these astonishing pictures as a poster and hang them up on your walls...You would stare at them in awe for hours!As far as buying it...it would be worth your money if you have kids who like volcanos or like to read because they would be able to appreciate it more. If not, it would be worth getting it to read at a public library or a used book. I would not spend too much money obtaining it."},{"Title":"Three in One: A Picture of God","review":"For teaching the basics of the trinity, this book is extremely helpful, fun and I have found adults even helped by the analogies and images given.You won't go wrong having this in your library and working through the story at bedtime with prayers."},{"Title":"Three in One: A Picture of God","review":"I have a 4yr old grandson and a son-in-law going thru classes to become Catholic.

I think the author does a good job of trying to take an incredibly difficult concept to grasp (the Trinity), and put it into language that children can understand.

It has very simple pictures, simple text and uses a lot or repetition, which I find very useful for younger children.

Familiarity with early-fourteenth-century English history will serve you well as you read this, but I suspect it can be enjoyed equally well by the newcomer to the joys of the medieval world. Fans of Irish history will find much to savor here as well."},{"Title":"Cashelmara","review":"Like another reviewer on this page, I can honestly say that this is one of my favorite books. I have re-read it several times and it gets better each time. Howatch is a master! I too find her Church of England series tedious and wish she would write another book in the tradition of Cashelmara, Wheel of Fortune, The Rich are Different - stories that are rich beyond compare and universally appealing."},{"Title":"Cashelmara","review":"This book is patterned after the lives of some medival kings of England, but even knowing the basic plot, I couldn't put it down. The story is told over a period of years through the eyes of 6 different characters. Ms. Howatch changes point of view in a masterful way. Plus there is no unnecessary 'biological detail' just to sell the book. A truly wonderful, marvellous book."},{"Title":"Cashelmara","review":"I am inadequate to review any of Susan Howatch's books, as the superiority of her writing humbles me. However, I feel compelled to make a few comments. One is that I am painfully hooked on her writing and wish that I were not. I was rivited to Cashelmara and Penmarric from beginning to end even though parts of both of them were emotionally gutwrenching, and at times I feel that Susan Howatch takes pleasure in causing her readers pain. Each time I read one of her books I say I'm not going to read another one, but I can't seem to help myself. I also read \\"The Rich are Different\\" which I thought was a tasteless title for such a superior work, and am now reading its sequal, \\"Sins of the Fathers.\\" I'm a glutton for punishment."},{"Title":"Cashelmara","review":"If you love page-turning, deeply involved family sagas, then Susan Howatch's novels are sure to please, and Cashelmara is a masterpiece of the genre. Cashelmara is a family estate belonging to nobleman, Edward de Salis, and his Irish estate, Cashelmara.The novel begins in Edward's point of view. He falls in love with Marguerite, a woman much younger who he brings to Ireland from America. Their story tells of his struggles to be a good husband and father, and fair overlord. Then the point of view switches to Marguerite who continues to move the story forward through her own experiences and struggles. Character by character, the story unfolds with each narrator's unique points of view - through scandals, betrayals, deceptions, murder, addictions, adultery, famines, and wars, the story takes us into the lives of three generations of this fascinating family. You name it, this story has it all.Beautiful prose, a fascinating family, and a disquieting but gripping tale kept me reading, eagerly anxious to return to the story whenever possible. Realistic characters, plenty of historical realism, and conflict after conflict reinforces my claim that Susan Howatch is a master of family sagas and one of my favourite all time authors. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Cashelmara","review":"Of all the historicals Susan Howatch has written, I love Cashelmara the best.If you're not familiar with Ms. Howatch's work, her historicals bring to life the reigns of English kings with an estate, in this case Cashelmara, representing England. The exception is The Rich Are Different and Sins of the Fathers. Those two books are based on Caesar, Cleopatra, Antony and Octavian.Each of the major characters in Cashelmara tells their own story starting with Edward DeSalis and each character tells their part of the story from their own point of view. There is never one side to a story, and Ms. Howatch gives each of her characters a chance to tell their side.As historical fiction, Cashelmara is well-researched and follows closely the lives of Edward I, Edward II, and the early life of Edward III.As a novel, it's a rip-roaring tale with a cast of fascinating characters. Whether you know the history or not, you'll enjoy this multi-generational saga of lust and power; my favorite kind of book.But for me, the real joy is the words. I can say these books are very well-written, but that's too easy a description. It might be more accurate to say that Ms. Howatch paints a picture with her words. No matter how I put it, the effect is that I am drawn into the lives of these people and I feel as if I'm a part of it all.There are very few authors whose entire body of work I can read straight through. Susan Howatch is one of the few. I will be diving into the Starbridge Series for the fourth time when I finish the historicals. I have a lot of good reading to look forward to."},{"Title":"Cashelmara","review":"After twenty years I re-read this book . It blew me away the first time and I,d read all of Howatch,s books by the age of 30. Going back into it the depth of the character outlines, the different strands of narrative, and brilliant story telling had me totally hooked again. Its only with age , and experience can you begin to understand the joy and tradegy of living which all her books are based on, and she depicts like no-one else love turning bitter, and how good can become evil . She's a truly great writer and I,m now going back to all her early novels .Even though I enjoyed the Starbridge series , her earlier historical epics I find more complex and intricate although they do show the dark side of human nature.. brilliant"},{"Title":"Cashelmara","review":"I cannot recall the last time a scene from a book has so thoroughly chilled me to the bone (and there were plenty more besides), but you'll have to read it for yourself to see what I'm talking about - I'm not telling! Set in Ireland in the latter part of the 19C, Howatch recounts three generations of the wealthy English de Salis family in six separate \\"books\\", each of those being in the first person POV of different characters.Edward de Salis visits his distant cousins the Marriotts in New York and brings a much younger Marguerite home as his bride. Despite the great difference in their ages, the two are well matched and soon have children of their own to add to Edward's brood from his first marriage. When Edward's eldest son Patrick inherits the de Salis lands and fortune, he marries Marguerite's niece Sarah and upon their return from New York they live in London until their lavish lifestyle and Patrick's gambling brings it to a screeching halt. Forced to economize, Sarah and Patrick start life fresh at Cashelmara but Edward comes under the influence of childhood friend Derry Stranahan. Derry's unnatural hold over Patrick continues to grow and leads to clashes in his marriage and with his Irish tenants until Derry's fate is sealed during an Irish riot. Eventually Sarah finds her hopes to repair the marriage and run a profitable estate are hindered once again by Patrick's too close relationship with another man - Hugh McGowan. Sarah soon finds herself an unwilling member of a triangle that for the sake of her children she endures until......well you know I don't tell all.Howatch takes the reader on quite ride in this one as Sarah's desperate situation forces her to make an unwise alliance of her own until she can return to Cashelmara - although that return sets in place another set of circumstances leading to a death by natural causes - or is there something more going on here? If this is sounding a bit like you've heard this story before, you're probably right. Howatch based her characters on the lives of England's first three Edwards and that's really half the fun of reading this novel. Can you spot Piers Gaveston? Hugh Despenser? Isabella and her lover Mortimer?All in all a near perfect read, the scenes between Patrick, Sarah and Hugh were downright bone chilling, let alone the effects of the famine on the Irish tenants. Darn near unputdownable, although the last hundred or so pages did slow down just a tad, and the ending itself just a bit too abrupt - although at 700 pages enough was probably enough. 4.5/5 stars and the story of the third \\"Edward\\" continues in Wheel of Fortune - but with entirely different characters."},{"Title":"Cashelmara","review":"Again I had forgotten what a wonderful writer Susan Howatch is. You can get totally wrapped up in her stories and even forget there is football on the TV. Her characters come to life and the reading is never boring."},{"Title":"Cashelmara","review":"My Thoughts: This is an epic saga following the lives and tribulations of the de Salis family. What made this book stand out for me, in amongst the many historical fiction books that I've read, is that the tale is told from six points of view. Six points of view are a lot and could easily become muddled and confusing but Ms Howatch deals with this in a very interesting way.The storyline, while linear, is started by Edward telling the tale. He then passes the proverbial torch to Marguerite and she takes over the story and so on. It's quite a wonderful way for the reader to get a better sense of what various characters are thinking while not rehashing what's already happened in the book. I actually found my initial attitude towards certain characters change as I saw the story through their eyes. Each of the characters had many sides to them which I appreciated. That said, I can't say that any one character stood out for me but they all had their own part to play in the saga.Please note that this is no light and carefree romp through the Irish countryside. It's more of a gothic soap opera with its romance, retribution, drama, abuse and even murder and has a very dark and rather depressing tone. One of the characters even goes a little too dark for my tastes and began to come off as more of an evil moustache-twisting caricature towards the end of the book.One of my favourite parts of the book were the descriptions of the Irish countryside as well as learning more about the historical backdrop (ie. the after effects of Ireland's Great Famine). But Ms Howatch didn't allow the tumultuous historical backdrop to overtake the storyline which I appreciated. While this is a historical fiction read, it's much more of a character driven plot. Keeping the characters and storyline in the forefront is not an easy thing to do when you're tackling a lot of various topics all in one book -- including Ireland's right to rule themselves, emigration, Irish famine/poverty, political unrest, adultery, financial ruin ... There was a lot going on and while it was entertaining I did feel that the mystery aspect (family secrets and all) as well as the overall energy of the book was a bit lacking.What Ms Howatch definitely didn't lack was emotion. Unfortunately, for me I tended to have an overall depressed feeling about the book. The setting and the circumstances seemed very drab and depressing ... all the time. There were some characters that I liked (Marguerite) but some, like Sarah, who just aggravated me with her poor choices. I guess feeling something (even anger at a character) is better than feeling nothing, right?While there were some slow parts in this large book I did find it to be an easy and enjoyable read. It was a good page turner of a story but it just didn't grab me as much as I would have hoped. I think that the overall depressing feeling that settled over much of the book put a damper on my overall opinion of this book.My Rating: 3.5/5 starsNote: My sincere thanks to Open Road Media and NetGalley for providing me with this complimentary e-book copy of this book in exchange for my honest review.This review, as well as many more, can be found on my blog, The Baking Bookworm (thebakingbookworm.blogspot.ca)"},{"Title":"Cashelmara","review":"Followed this author for years.

Cashelmara is on that list, along with Howatch's other &#34;family sagas''. She brings the reader into each narrator's mind, allowing the reader to find things about each one to identify with. Cashelmara tells the story of two generations of English lords who own an estate in Ireland during the turbulent years of the potato famine and Parnell. Each marries an American bride which brings another dimension to the story. While this book has adult themes, it doesn't dwell on the act so much as the aftermath. This is powerful novel."},{"Title":"Cashelmara","review":"Unlike some of the reviewers, I read this book because I liked the Church of England series. This &quot;family&quot; history was captivating and unusual because each section was told through the eyes of different family members. It was somewhat like looking at the family through a prism. Ms. Howatch writes delicately and well and manages to adjust her style to the different characters' styles and personalities.Although the book is long, it is not a difficult book to read. There is probably not enough here for my book club to discuss, (no Poisonwood here); however, it is a very enjoyable book."},{"Title":"Cashelmara","review":"I rate this book 4.5 stars.Cashelmara is a saga about an Irish family through three generations. If the title doesn't grab you, Howatch's writing will. The story is mesmerizing and spine tingling. Psychological motivations, dysfunction and macabre machinations abound. Although designated as historical fiction, the novel shines in the characters and their relationships. I'd call it a psychological thriller as well as historical fiction.The de Salis family owns an estate in England, but can't seem to give up the remote, mysterious Cashelmara in Ireland. \\"If anyone says silence is inaudible, they have never heard the silence of Cashelmara. It was a living silence, unearthly and unnerving.\\" The estate has a mystical quality to it and is a constant presence in the characters' motivations.The story is told from the points of view of three generations of men, their wives and an activist farmer.

But overall, it was a great read."},{"Title":"Cashelmara","review":"Susan Howatch has written a gripping multigenerational tale of a titled English family who live on their Irish estate, Cashelmara, during the 19th century. This family saga is interwoven with Irish and English politics of the period, self-rule, the Great Famine, emigration, etc.. The years after the Irish famine were marked with issues like the land question and the struggle for independence. Tenants started to demand more security of land tenure. At the same time, landlords were eager to remove paupers from their land to reduce their poor law charges. The landlord/tenant divide was exacerbated by this conflict. The drama of Cashelmara takes place against this explosive backdrop.Edward de Salis, an English nobleman with vast landholdings in Ireland and England travels to America and visits the Marriot family, distant relations in New York City. De Salis, a man in his fifties, has been a widower for eight years and has a young son, Patrick, and three older daughters, all married or living away from home. He returns to England with plans to marry seventeen year-old Marguerite Marriot, to his family's great consternation. Marguerite and Edward are married at the family estate, Cashelmara. Oddly enough the marriage turns out to be a love match. Times become difficult when Edward dies and finances become tight. Cashelmara and the situation in Ireland begin to weigh heavily on the family with unexpected results. This historical novel is filled with romance, intrigue, social and political unrest and family drama.Ms. Howatch is able to vividly describe the same situation through the eyes of various characters. These differing points of view give tremendous depth to her characters and interesting insight into their personalities and ulterior motives. The events they are involved in become more complex when all the versions are compiled. Cashelmara's plot unfolds through the individual stories of five people. The author's research and attention to detail are meticulous and give the reader insight into the hardships and difficulties of 19th century Ireland. Cashelmara is an example of excellent historical fiction.JANA"},{"Title":"Cashelmara","review":"This is the kind of book I love--- involved, lots of interesting charactors, a story that is believable and makes one want to keep reading. The middle of the book gets into a subject that was not mentioned much in other books I have read that were written in the mid 70's, and I was surprised when the plot took that turn, although the hints were there from the first. I just wasn't expecting the story to get so specific. I had my favorite charactors, then they would turn out to be not what I had thought-- the whole book was one I kept looking forward to going back to.When I finished it, I was almost drained with emotion. That sure doesn't happen to me very often. I loved it."},{"Title":"Cashelmara","review":"'Cashelmara' is Susan Howatch's re-telling of the story of Edward II, King of England 1307-1327, updated to nineteenth-century Ireland. If you're not at all interested in Edward II, or know nothing about him, it's absolutely no problem - you can thoroughly enjoy this novel anyway. However, working out who each character represents historically - for example, Derry Stranahan is 'really' Edward II's favourite Piers Gaveston, while Maxwell Drummond stands for Queen Isabella's lover Roger Mortimer - was a big part of my enjoyment of the novel!'Cashelmara' is divided into six sections. Each section is narrated in the first person, by a different character. I love this structure, as you really get into the heads of the different characters, and see how they think and see themselves and others. Howatch has complete command of her structure and pulls it off wonderfully.If you know anything about fourteenth-century English history, you'll see how accurate a re-telling it is. If not, you're sure to enjoy a well-told and fascinating novel that's full of emotional ups and downs. I agree with a previous reviewer who called it emotionally draining!

You'll never tire of this complex and revealing novel, and once you read it, it will occur to you at odd moments forever."},{"Title":"Cashelmara","review":"This and every one of Susan Howatch's novels are well worth the time put into them. They're literate, challenging and dare to explore questions of faith, love, family and loyalty. And while her &quot;potboiler&quot; novels are excellent, DON'T be put off by the 6-volume Church of England series. The characters are engaging and the questions and answers they discover during the traumatic events of their lives and the eventual renewal of their souls took me to philosophical places I'd never been before and forced me to often consider the same issues the characters themselves grappled with. That's what's wrong with people today - they're intellectually lazy and don't want to deal with issues of faith, belief, and the renewing powers of love. However, Ms. Howatch does so with a style and flair and gift with the written word that I can only sit back, read and envy and admire. More! More!"},{"Title":"Cashelmara","review":"This is the first book I have read by Susan Howatch. I generally dont read much of fiction and this book looked too thick as well. But I picked up this book at a friend's place when I had nothing to do and started reading it just for the sake of it. Well, I had to borrow the book home (and have no intentions of returning it) and read it as if my life depended on finishing it. The story spans three generations and the characters seem real. These are people who driven by circumstances (including a crop famine) and family ties hate, love,sacrifice, take revenge, and even kill. Gripping stuff. You will be able to identify with all the characters in the book and thanks to the writer's skill, will be able to understand why they behave the way they do.

It's something you can pick up and read cover to cover, or a chapter at a time. What I particularly like about it is how refreshing and clean the book is. It's a book about a journey that gives the authors a cross-section of America, both literally and figuratively. They tell you what they like, what they don't like, what they expected, and what they did not.Sometimes books of this nature get a bit preachy (i.e. you should live life the way I do), but this book doesn't go there. It is frank about beliefs, opinions, pleasures and disappointments, and draws you in to the journey. I found myself chuckling at various stories, and sharing those with my wife. At other times I shared the disappointment the authors experienced. At all times I felt like my toes were dangling in the water with them.The photos are terrific. These are the types of shots that give the adage &quot;A photo is worth a thousand words,&quot; real meaning. I'm not sure if I laughed more at the photo: &quot;Andy Warhol Bruised My Banana&quot; or the title of the photo itself. I kept thinking, 'These two have WAY too much time on their hands'... but then again, that's where the real beauty of this book lies.Buy it. Share it.

All the same, neither Carewe nor Vignola are listed at all, while some other extremely talented directors like Donald Crisp rate an unjust dismissal as \\"undistinguished\\". Everson is always at his best, however, when discussing the virtues and defects of mystery thrillers like \\"Sherlock Holmes\\" and \\"The Cat and the Canary\\"."},{"Title":"Historical accounts","review":"According to his Wikipedia page, William K. Everson led a very interesting life as a film critic, student, teacher, and more. This is the first book of his that I've read, and it covers many different aspects of the silent film era: the business, the distribution, the directors (most prominently, D.W. Griffith), the stars, the editing, the story lines, the subtitles, the set design, the locations, the technology, and of course, the films themselves. A lot of interesting stuff. Unfortunately, I've only seen a small minority of the films Everson discusses, and that often made it hard to appreciate his points. He offers many opinions on just about everything, and I enjoyed reading them even though I'm not able to know if I agree or disagree with him.It was interesting to read accounts of Griffith that focus on his talent rather than his racism. I'm looking forward to watching Intolerance, which I have on my TiVo, and hope to one day see Birth of a Nation so that I can make my own judgment about Griffith. Everson's book also introduced me to another Griffith film, Orphans of the Storm which sounded intriguing and which I also now hope to one day see.There were times when I wanted to give this book four stars, but there were also a few stretches that came across, to me at least, as pretty dry so I ended up settling on three stars. Although I find the silent era to be very interesting, I haven't seen nearly as many silent films as I'd like. I suspect that I'd have given this book a higher rating if I had seen more of the movies that Everson described."},{"Title":"Frommer's Costa Rica 2001","review":"You'll need at least one or two other guides if you're going to Costa Rica for the first time.

However, the book itself is not that great. There isn't much information and lots of the smaller places to see aren't mentioned, or if they are it is just a very little bit. The major stuff to see is here, and the restaurant descriptions are good. But if your wanting to do something off the beaten path this book will not provide you with the information you need. Sometimes having more than one guide book can be helpful, this would make a good secondary guide book. It isn't all bad, but you'd be better off with the lonely planet book.

Unless You Know to Ask","review":"Medical Tests That Can Save Your Life: 21 Tests Your Doctor Won't Order... Unless You Know to Ask is exactly what as the title states. Inside are nineteen conditions that are often not tested by doctors. Each of the conditions gives a description of the physical condition, risk factors (separated by those that you can modify and those that you can't), your risk level, and tests you may want to request. After the condition is explained in detail and the appropriate tests suggested, the book ends with a section that describes the tests including what the test checks for, how reliable it is, health risks, and approximate cost. The final part of the book covers the standard treatment for the various conditions once they have been verified.One of the reasons these tests are often not given by doctors is because they don't show many symptoms until they are well advanced. So how do you know you should request one of these tests? The authors provide some of the circumstances under which you might want to request the test. For example, hemochromatosis is most prevalent in people with a Celtic ancestry. If you have a different ancestry you are unlikely to need to have the exam taken.Medical Tests That Can Save Your Life is a highly recommended book although I will have to admit that I am somewhat prejudiced. I have several relatives whose lives would have been much better if someone had ordered the test for hemochromatosis earlier in their lives."},{"Title":"Medical Tests That Can Save Your Life: 21 Tests Your Doctor Won't Order. . . Unless You Know to Ask","review":"When most patients visit a doctor, they go either for a routine checkup or to investigate a specific complaint, perhaps chest pain. What these patients do not know is that after the patient has finished being examined by that physician, this physician may not order a test that conceivably could prove helpful in either detecting or diagnosing a disease. In MEDICAL TESTS THAT CAN SAVE YOUR LIFE, David Johnson and David Sandmire outline a series of tests that might just do what the title implies. The authors suggest that physicians refrain from mentioning these tests, not out of meanness, but mostly because these tests range in price from the reasonably cheap to the outrageously expensive, and insurance companies would be quick to place over eager physicians on their \\"do not use\\" list. The answer, the authors suggest, is for the self-informed patient to bite the bullet and pay for needed tests out of pocket. Clearly, what a patient needs is a ready reference. Johnson and Sandmire have filled the gap with their eminently readable and useful text that does far more than list test names. They begin by telling the reader how to create a personal risk profile that sets forth not only the reader's medical history but that of the reader's first degree and second degree relatives. They also urge the reader to describe any pertinent patient use related to tobacco and alcohol use. Helpful notes on general diet and exercise would also help a patient convince a physician to listen more attentively to a need for costly tests. Johnson and Sandmire also point out that a physician is more likely to pay attention when a patient sounds knowledgable about matters medical.Most of MTTCSYL outline some twenty diseases that are unfortunately common with America's overfed and underexercised adult population. The reader is free to browse them and note illnesses that range from colorectal cancer to hepatitus C to prostate cancer. Each disease discusses risk factors both modifiable and nonmodifiable and a handy chart that uses a point system that enables the reader to identify a potentially significant risk level. Once that reader has been honest enough to do so, then the authors list the appropriate medical tests. Fully one half of the text is devoted to these tests. The authors consider what these tests are, how they are administered, what they cost, and how reliable they are. For patients who are motivated enough to do their homework before stepping into a physician's waiting room, MTTCSYL can be a life saving read."},{"Title":"Best and Worst Email Tales","review":"This is a fun book!

(And maybe the top female duo.) For those of us who grew up equating Mexican food with Tex-Mex, Miliken and Feniger's inventive take on traditional Mexican cuisine is a revelation. Their &quot;Border Grill&quot; in Santa Monica (4th and Broadway) is a noisy, splashy, foodie haven with superb drinks, a decent wine/beer list, and amazing food. For several years they also produced a fun and informational show on the Food network before that cable network went all-Emeril all-the-time. &quot;Cooking with Two Hot Tamales&quot; captures a lot of recipes and tips from the show. Many of the recipes herein one occasionally sees on Border Grill's menu. The house gucamole recipe is almost worth the price of the book on its own!As a cookbook, Two Hot Tamales is interesting, has an attractive layout, and, by the minimal standards of the genre, is well-written. Unlike their Mesa Mexicana, which I recomend only for the hobbyist chef with access to a decent Mexican grocer and time on his/her hands, Two Hot Tamales can be used on an everyday basis. Few of the recipes involve intensive prep work -- after all, they had to be prepared within the confines of a 30 minute TV show. Equally important for users outside the South-west, few of the recipes require specialized ingredients. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Cooking with Too Hot Tamales : Recipes & Tips From Tv Food's Spiciest Cooking Duo","review":"\`too hot tamales' and \`Mesa Mexicana' are the two books currently available from the chef / teaching / restauranteur team known as the \`too hot tamales' of early Food Network fame, Mary Sue Milliken and Susan Feniger. They recently went up against Bobby Flay on \`Iron Chef America'. Not that it really matters, but I don't remember who won or what the secret ingredient was. What is important is that it was easily one of the most entertaining and memorable \`Iron Chef America' episodes, comparable to the very first one featuring Chicago Mexican cuisine expert Rick Bayless and the competition featuring Oriental fusion master, Ming Tsai of \`Blue Ginger'. What I do remember is the imprint of the iron on the back of Susan Feniger's blouse and the inventive recipe they did for Scotch eggs.The first impression of both of these books is not inspiring. The layout is ordinary, leaning toward the garish. The photographs are in a grainy black and white and too small to easily make sense of what is happening, not to mention the fact that most are missing captions. In \`too hot tamales', it is even difficult to tell which of these two delightful ladies is Mary Sue and which is Susan, from the lack of clear identification on the photographs. The flyleaf of \`Mesa Mexicana' clears this up. Mary Sue is the taller with blond hair and Susan is the shorter with dark hair. They also neglect to give a good picture of co-author, Helene Siegel, whose voice seems to be strong in the prefaces and introductions.Based on the strong \`Iron Chef America' appearance, I decided to check out the books from this duo, even though their Food Network show was before my time. I figured two gals with this much energy and a strong showing against the indomitable Bobby must have something to say. At the outset, the book \`too hot tamales' did not impress, until I got to the chapters on soups. At this point, the authors' observations seemed to come alive. This was not nearly as strong as what I saw in Deborah Madison's recent book on soups, but the comparison showed that Mary Sue and Susan clearly had something important to say. That is not to say that \`too hot tamales' is the better book. \`Mesa Mexicana' is actually the better of the two for anyone who is not familiar with Mexican cooking. Having determined that these books have something to say, the next big question is why get these books instead one from the heavy hitters of Mexican cuisine, Rick Bayless or Diana Kennedy.For starters, both Bayless and Kennedy's best books are more strongly oriented toward teaching Mexican cooking, either by technique or by region. Milliken and Feniger's books are more for fun, without straying too far from strong roots in genuine Mexican cooking technique. If all you want are some good, snappy recipes without being tied to the grill (as you are with many of Bobby Flay's recipes), Milliken and Feniger may be your best choice. They are certainly your best choice if you are attracted to entertaining with a Mexican theme. I had an epiphany of insight when I realized that a rather large number of pages in both books, as well as many pages in many other cookbooks are dedicated to \`starters', \`finger food', \`appetizers', \`hors \`d'ourves', \`antipasto' and what have your. But if you live in a typical family, how much time do you really spend making \`party food' in comparison to daily breakfasts, lunches, and suppers. Why don't cookbooks dedicate 20% of their books to breakfast and 35% of their books to brown bag food rather than giving so much room to entertaining food, which the average cook may make once a month, if they are inclined to entertain with food in the first place.All this means is that these books are much more valuable to you if you do entertain often. This is especially true because both books are very reasonably priced, appropriate to their uninspired art work. It is also true because of the rather odd organization of the recipes. In both books, some chapters are organized by function or meal, some by style of cooking, and some by principle ingredient. This means neither book is especially good if you want to find a book to fit a particular function or to use a particular ingredient. The fact that both books are relatively short confirms that neither book may be very useful if you have room for only a very small cookbook collection. But if you can afford the money and space for a large cookbook collection, you will probably already have one or more volumes from Kennedy and Bayless, so why load yourself up with our spicy gals?For most people, the answer is simply that they are great fun to read and their recipes get right to the point. If you are a foodie, you don't need another tutorial on technique. If you are a casual cook who entertains, you can go straight to the largely very concise recipes and get on with it. So, both books are easily worth the room they take up on your shelves.As an aside, it is really interesting to see our gals' comments on the cooking talents of the Mexicans, which is very similar to Tony Bourdain's comments in \`A Cook's Tour', where he states that almost all his line chefs at \`Les Halle' are Mexican with practically no formal training, yet they are as capable as most French trained cooks.If you really like cookbooks or you really like Mexican food, I recommend both of these books."},{"Title":"Cooking with Too Hot Tamales : Recipes & Tips From Tv Food's Spiciest Cooking Duo","review":"This cookbook was one of the first ones in my collection, which now numbers over 100 cookbooks.

Few artists in any medium have matured so completely yet unpredictably. This book catalogues her sustained growth while never falling into the biography trap of idoltry.Unfortunately, since L.A. tours so infrequently it's difficult to study her creativity at close range.

More than a topographical description of the silk road, it is a gallop though history explaining paths taken by silk to get to Europe. It starts in prehistoric china and ends with the Karakorum highway, synthetizing in twenty chapters the reasons for the often difficult diffusion of luxury products from the Far East. The author, that evidently knows well chinese history and mentality, takes us by hand into the ancient cinese political issues as to foreign commerce, the fundamental role played by Iranians, byzantines and arabs during the Middle Ages up to the wary reciprocal opening of European and Cinese worlds due to brave and curious travelers. So we meet princesses, monks and merchants and get to know their fascinanting stories. One point of force of the book is the meticulous and modern analysis of these travel tales, so we have a critical perspective of what has come down in history and makes up our cultural background. Marco Polo get's revisited and also less well known ancient and modern travelers are cited.Boulnois loves silk (her detailed description of materials of the old world and how they were made is enlightening)and its history, so she brings us to her country, France, and to the evolution of the silk industry in the XIX and XX century. And this somehow closes the circle of the story of this precious tissue that reached its apogeum in the last century.The book however is much more than this and carries a great amount of information. It could be described actually as a textbook on the history of silk. It is well written even if not too easy to read, and sometimes it is a little repetitive.I enjoyed it very much and feel enriched by its reading."},{"Title":"Silk Road","review":"This book is interesting to the general reader but it is very hard to use in a classroom setting. There are many repetitions, too many different names for the students to remember and very little linear thinking.

Shea also often will put two or three topics that have little to do with each other in the same chapter.

Who ARE all these people? They have names that rhyme. And the history is so long. Greece, Rome, maybe seven hundred years apiece, it's over.Luce Boulnois, in what I suspect is an excellent translation (still has the verbal zing of a French speaker, but none of the awkwardness of a word-by-word transcription), manages to makes this long term overview sympathetic. It's not like being hammered with a string of weird names. She tells relevant episodes among well-defined characters, beginning with the Romans and the Parthians, flashing back to the earlier history of silk cultivation among the early parts of what would become the Empire of China. The reader gains some understanding of the methods and difficulties of raising very fussy, ravenous caterpillars, and the way these methods diffused into the west. I liked the earlier parts with the more colorful characters better, but even I was interested in the collapse of China's leadership and the rise of the west (it's short and pithy).I would have liked more maps, in the beginning; I greatly enjoyed the color photos, and if I should ever be inclined to travel east, I suspect the list of Silk Road-related museums would be invaluable."},{"Title":"Silk Road","review":"This is a fascinating coverage of a area, region call it what you may.

Ask any loving man that has a self absorbed wife.

The main thing is planning. If you plan ahead you will make divorce as painless for you as possible. If you are a woman reading this and think god how could someone write about this, take a look at the number of books written on the reverse side that show how to squeeze a man until he cries like a choir boy.

As we all realize, IF a man has a girlfriend waiting patiently for him, she is not the cause of the breakup and the author points out how supportive she can be, and needs to be. My only (slight) objection to the generally good references about the girlfriend is that ALL examples except one assume that she is naturally a &quot;younger woman.&quot; Many times she will be. But, same age and &quot;older&quot; women are often girlfriends of divorcing men, also. The under-35&quot; female is NOT favored by lots of men, for a variety of reasons, (which may not align with the author's personal preferences.)

Most of the book is a juvenile, repetitive rant about lawyers, judges and ex-wives. Example:&quot;Whoa. Hang in there. Don't give up. Bad as it might be, divorce is just an expensive journey through our illustrious justice sewer, I mean, system.&quot;The book focuses mostly on how the husband will get screwed by the legal system, yet there is little practical advice about the legal aspects of divorce. For example, in the back of the book is a list of which states are community property states, and which are equitable distribution, yet it is never explained what these terms mean. There is a whole chapter on going through a divorce when one has a girlfriend, yet it is not mentioned that this may in some states be a very bad idea. In the list in the back of the book, it's obtusely referred to as &quot;Alimony barred by marital misconduct&quot;. Several things discussed under &quot;Hide Your Money&quot; border on criminal.The book's barely redeeming feature is it's advice on dealing with the emotional trauma of divorce, and the various reactions different types of women have to the suspicion or reality that their husband is leaving them."},{"Title":"How To Dump Your Wife: Practical Advice For The Good Man Trapped In A Bad Marriage","review":"I read this book after being dumped by my partner of 27 years because I honestly wanted to see the man's side of things. Well, the cruel and so-called &quot;humorous&quot; tips on how to cheat on your wife and deprive her of her legal rights confirmed what people warned: You've become just a business deal and a chess game to him. It helped me anticipate (especially the chapter on How to Hide Your Money) what Mr. Wonderful and his new woman (of course, 15 years younger) would eventually do--write off romantic interludes as &quot;business expenses&quot;, put his income in her name and live happily ever after--2,000 miles away so he'd never have to co-parent. Six figure income and European travel, yet no alimony and only 800 a month child support? In fact, it cost me a fortune in legal bills just to defend against bogus affidavits by HIS attorney, designed to scare me into compliance. This is the kind of guy who will later whine that his kids are strangers and his ex-wife is a witch. And guess what Mr. Covington--did you warn the prospective new wife/girlfriend that whatever he did to #1 to get to her, is probably what he'll do to her to get to #3? I found this book unfortunately polarizing and cruel, but at least it served as warning of what I was up against. For something really valuable, both genders should read Crazy Time. Nobody wins in a divorce, especially not the girlfriend who's egged it on."},{"Title":"How To Dump Your Wife: Practical Advice For The Good Man Trapped In A Bad Marriage","review":"It seems to me that this book appeals to the most selfish sort of husband or girl friend. It is too bad that a person who would agree with the things said in this book would be very unlikely to become more happy after following the advice given. Unless a person learns to be less selfish, I am quite sure a man will discover that the perfect girl friend, who has now become the perfect wife, will in no time turn into what the author calls Wife One, Wife Two or Wife Three, which are three stereotypical kinds of problem wives. Likewise, the man who remains single with his piles of hidden money bags is unlikely to find a bit of happiness until he can learn about truth and justice. It's not a pleasant world for the man who must suspect every person of being just as dishonest and inequitable as he has been."},{"Title":"The Black Douglases: War and Lordship in Medieval Scotland 1300-1455","review":"I found this book to be highly interesting in its content. The author shows how the Douglases went from the front line defenders of Scotland to a dominant magnate house that could challenged the King of Scotland. It was interesting how initially close the Douglases were to the royal house of Scotland (the Bruces). It was that closeness that allowed the Douglases to rise to power and become one of Scotland's greatest clans during its heydays. But ironically, it was the inability of the Douglases to adjust and adapt to the changing relationship between themselves and their rulers as the nature of medieval kingship changes. This led directly to the tragic results of this family.While I found this book to be very informative, I also found it to be very dry reading material. Despite of the exciting subject matter, the author's text proves to be very clincial in nature. The book also don't give much background material so readers who are relatively new to the subject field (Anglo-Scottish conflicts and basic Scottish medieval history) may feel bit left out on many of the references the book mentioned, references that author obviously expect the readers to know already.I recommended this book for experience medieval readers who would like to have a closer in-depth look at one of Scotland's legendary families of the medieval period."},{"Title":"The Black Douglases: War and Lordship in Medieval Scotland 1300-1455","review":"This is yet another impressive work of scholarship regarding Scottish history from Scotland's own Tuckwell Press. Michael Brown has produced a well researched, thoughtful, and comprehensive study of one of the premier Scottish families. He demonstrates how one well placed family was able to become a force of reckoning, first in the troublesome Anglo-Scottish border lands, then throughout Scotland, and even in France during the period of 1300 to 1455. This phenomenal rise was conducted by a series of family leaders invariably named James or Archibald Douglas who generally combined qualities of political acumen, ruthless military efficiency, shrewd feudal management, and a remarkable persistence in the face of adversity. Their aggrandizement of power was first enabled under King Robert the Bruce(reigned 1306-1329) during his long running wars with England and the need for strong military leaders like Sir James Douglas, known as 'The Good Sir James,' whose daring exploits emboldened the Scottish cause and brought terror to the inhabitants of northern England. In the wake of the Bruce's death and a dearth of strong kingship in Scotland, the family moved into the power vacuum and emerged as a primary arbitor of the peace and defender of the realm in the face of renewed and sustained English aggression. The Black Douglases enhanced their position with an impressive web of relationships encompassing the church and notable families alike. Unfortunately, they came to epitomize the concept of the overmighty subject and were finally brought down after a series of bloody and often treacherous conflicts by two very strong kings, James I (reigned 1406-1437, primarily during his last decade) and James II (reigned 1437-1460). The maps and figures printed in this book are very good and help explain the complexity of the inter-relationships of families, lands, and castles. Brown's prose is well crafted but this book is more for the medieval or military specialist rather than the casual or general reader. It might also be of some use to family historians in the sense that one can note the influence and lands of numerous families with names such as Sinclair, Ramsey, Drummond, and Hay. It is a must for anyone interested in the intricacy of medieval lordship."},{"Title":"The Black Douglases: War and Lordship in Medieval Scotland 1300-1455","review":"Be prepared to flip back and forth from the chapter you are reading to the geneological tables constantly. The fact that all of the Douglases seem to be named either Archibald or James makes it extremely confusing to read. However, this book provides a detailed and authoritative look at one of the most important families in medival Scotland. The author weaves engrossing prose into a book that other authors might have written in a too scholarly manner. For those interested in a covering two centuries of the history of Scotland through lense of a notorious warring family, this book is a must read."},{"Title":"The Black Douglases: War and Lordship in Medieval Scotland 1300-1455","review":"The Black Douglases, War and Lordship in Medieval Scotland 1300-1455, by Michael Brown is an informative read. Not for the novice to Medieval Scottish history, Michael Brown will provide an education for you. Though the title is the Black Douglases whom all the lessons revolve around the book is more of an education based on the subtitle of War and Lordship in Medieval Scotland 1300-1455. The Douglas family is the medium the lesson is taught.Michael Brown gives us great chapters on each of the great Black Douglases starting with \\"The Good\\" Sir James, right hand of Robert the Bruce. We learn of his brother Archibald \\"the Tyneman\\" and his struggles to maintain the family's role as warlords and defenders of the throne. Then we see first hand the internal rivalries of the different branches of the Black Douglases or the illegitimate and legitimate descendents of both \\"The Good\\" Sir James and Archibald \\"the Tyneman\\" and how both used the crown and a source of power to achieve the title of Earl of Douglas. Each chapter is like a mini biography explaining the life and reasons each Earl did what he did. Then we get a few chapters that really dive into Lordship and how it worked on the borders of England. How land and allegiance lead to the rise of many other border families and how war is the catalyst that brings it all together.The Black Douglases rise as the leading family of Scotland and become renowned throughout Europe as leaders in Warfare and are even recognized by the Pope. Finally there pride and power are brought to heal by the strong Kingships of James I and II of Scotland. Although the Black Douglases fade we see the seeds of the Red Douglases of Angus and those of the Douglas Earls of Morton's which will continue in the role of the strongest family next to and behind the throne of Scotland for the next 200 years.This book is an excellent tribute to the Douglas family which should be recognized for there amazing impact on Scottish and European history. Although the book bogs down sometimes it forces you to slow down and really understand the detail presented. An excellent history lesson and tribute to the Douglas family. For the serious student of Scottish history or those interested in the Douglas family."},{"Title":"The Roads and Highways of Ancient Israel.

Indeed, chunks of HITLER'S PRIESTESS, particularly the chapter on Savitri's husband A.K. Mukherji, read like loose paraphrases of these interviews, paraphrases that are so close to the original that I would count them plagiarism if an undergraduate handed it in to me. Goodrick-Clarke's dependence on these interviews does not, however, prevent him from making some extremely bad mistakes in transcribing them: the Ram Gopal dance company is rendered the \\"Randoopa\\" dance company, Jallundhar College as \\"Jerandan,\\" Joda near Barajamda as \\"Jordania-Barajonda.\\" Of course there never was a \\"Randoopa\\" dance company and no map of India contains \\"Jerandan\\" and \\"Jordania-Barajonda,\\" but that did not stop Goodrick-Clarke.AND TIME ROLLS ON is an absolutely fascinating read. I could not put it down until I finished it. If you are interested in Savitri Devi, this is the place to start. It is also required reading for those interested in such figures as George Lincoln Rockwell, Colin Jordan, John Tyndall, Francoise Dior, Sven Hedin, Ram Gopal, A.K. Mukherji, and of course Adolf Hitler and his influence. AND TIME ROLLS ON also offers what is surely the most novel explanation for how Hermann Goering got ahold of potassium cyanide and cheated the hangman: Savitri dreamt that she astrally projected herself into Goering's cell and gave him the cyanide, and Sven Hedin suggested that it was a genuine case of astral projection. Somebody alert David Irving!Beyond being fascinating reading, AND TIME ROLLS ON is a beautifully designed and produced book, worthy of the finest academic presses. The paperback edition is bound in sewn signatures, which is the most durable binding by far. These are books that one would be proud to give and glad to receive as gifts."},{"Title":"And Time Rolls On : The Savitri Devi Interviews","review":"A very interesting thought provoking interview with a woman who was able to think outside the box during a time of duress and during a time of unabashed national propaganda via the news media (like today). Whether you agree or not this was an engrossing interview. Well worth my time and led me to purchase additional books for more self education and enlightenment."},{"Title":"And Time Rolls On : The Savitri Devi Interviews","review":"Kudos to Counter-Currents for bringing out this second, slightly corrected edition, and for making it available as an inexpensive Kindle. As far as I can determine, it&#8217;s the only work of Savitri&#8217;s available on Kindle, and fortunately it&#8217;s the best one for someone to start with, as it covers the whole gamut of her extraordinary life and ideas, in her own not-to-be-imitated words.As the editor points out, much of Goodrick-Clarke&#8217;s &#8220;Hitler&#8217;s Priestess&#8221; consists largely of paraphrases of material from these interview tapes, so anyone only familiar with her only through that book needs to acquaint himself with his hidden source.Those who have only heard puzzling rumors about some French-Hindu woman who promoted animal rights before Peter Singer was born yet deified Hitler as a Divine Avatar and praised the Aztecs for gaining social peace by channeling violence into an institutionalized human sacrifice will find here what they need to get a handle on this enigma, at a price that will make it the best &#8220;impulse buy&#8220; you make this year.And after all, what&#8217;s so puzzling?

This is possibly due to having been published in April of 2003, or the lack of acknowledgement of Seung Sahn in the write-ups you find of the book. The face of the author is not truly important, however. This book is essentially a book filled with Zen kong-ans (koans) that Zen master Seung Sahn has often used throughout the years he taught.There are 235 koans in this work, to be exact. Following each koan, Zen master Seung Sahn asks the reader a few questions, then provides a somewhat brief commentary. This book is NOT for entertainment, if you expect something along the lines of The Compass of Zen or Only Don't Know by the same author, you may be disappointed. What this book does contain is &quot;mind meals&quot;- questions and koans you could hold for many years. Your answering each koan right off is quite slim, seeing as how they are not intended to be &quot;entered&quot; via the intellect. That would be understanding Zen, not attainment. Attainment is expressed quite differently. I hope you enjoy this book!"},{"Title":"Zen: The Perfect Companion (Perfect Companions!)","review":"I picked the book up in San Fransisco and looked through it a bunch to find out if it was the real thing, or if it was just a watered down version of Zen Buddhism and found it was very in depth and extremely complicated. As I've ben reading through it I've found it very helpful, but a little confusing. The writing is very choppy and the author expects the reader to understand certain principles of Buddhism before reading. It is not an introductory book, but a challenging one. I would suggest it to anyone who practices zen meditation already and wishes to enhance their practice. This book it a guide to be used along with a journal and should not be the only part of your zen practice. It is a very truthful, straightforward, and helpful guide, but is not for everyone."},{"Title":"Zen: The Perfect Companion (Perfect Companions!)","review":"Pick it up and put it all down."},{"Title":"J. Gresham Machen: A Biographical Memoir","review":"A monument to the great leader of the modern evangelical movement and the author of many classical works of apologetics, this definitive biography of J. Gresham Machen by his intimate friend, associate and successor, is base upon vast amount of letters, memoranda and other documents(filling nearly thirty drawers in the Machen files) in addition to the author's personal reminiscences, and an evaluation of Machen's published writings.an intimate and personal account which leaves no aspect of Machen's full and brilliant life untoouched, Ned B. Stonehouse's full-scale portrait is a vivid and inspiring picture of a Christian of apostolic ardor who, at his untimely death in 1937, was called \\"the first Protestant minister in the nation.\\" Acknowledged by his critics and admirers alike as the greatest leader of the whole cause of evangelical Christianity in modern times, Machen raised the intellectual acuteness of Protestant orthodoxy to a point where observers such as H. L. Mencken and Walter Lippmann claimed that in the religious debates of the twenties and thirties, the liberals had yet to answer him.Writing out of the experiences of more than seven years of intimate asociation with Machen and a wealth of sources which reveal completely the mind and heart of this learned and valiant spiritual warrior, Stonehouse tells the complete Machen story: the childhood years, the student days at Princeton under Warfield and Patton, the years abroad at the universities of Marburg and Gottingen, and again in 1918-19 in France and Belgium, Machen's books, his deep attachment to his remarkable mother, his cultural pursuits and love of literature, and the historic controversies at Princeton which led to his reorganization of that seminary, and to the founding of Westminster Theological Seminary in Philadelphia, in which Machen played a leading role.Dr. Stonehouse's biography is a perceptive and illuminating account which reveals in Machen, warmly and personally, both the man and the scholar; and, becaue of Machen's weighty influence over the ecclesiastical world of his time, is an intimate history of the twentieth century evangelical struggle.--- from book's back cover"},{"Title":"Climbers Guide to the Great Falls of Potomac","review":"For its time, this was THE book to have if you wanted to climb at Great Falls. It was the most comprehensive book on the market (heck, it was the ONLY book on the market!) for climbing at Great Falls. Jim Eakin had done a fabulous job of compiling all the route information to the area into a nice, small, pocket-sized book. Back in its day, this was a 5-star book. However...It has become obsolete. In 2001 it was superceded by a second edition assembled by Alex Tait. The new edition included more climbs, more photos, more topos, and better maps (the ones in the first edition were already quite good). So if you pick up the first edition of this book, it'll be mostly for nostalgia (the route information isn't totally obsolete, but the new book does have more routes, and updates on some routes which are now closed for climbing). The second edition is a 5-star book."},{"Title":"Barrier-Breaking Resumes and Interviews","review":"This book gives very basic and practical examples of how to write a resume if you have challenges or &quot;barriers&quot; such as no formal job experience, substance abuse or a criminal record in your past. I highly recommend it for welfare-to-work populations and prison-to-work populations, if these persons have little or no knowledge of how to market themselves on paper to get a job. The reading level and &quot;white space&quot; on the pages also makes it relevant for those with lower literacy skills. I found if very useful for the target audience the authors intended (&quot;those who have little or no work experience, have just been released from prison, or were formerly on public assistance&quot;). The book will not be useful to anyone who does not fit the target audience; it is much too basic and targeted to novice job seekers.

Great job Drew!"},{"Title":"Oxen: A Teamster's Guide","review":"By Sharon Keeler UNH News BureauDURHAM, N.H. -- On a cold night in 1978, 13-year-old Drew Conroy and his father drove 30 miles over snowy New Hampshire roads to look at twin Brown Swiss calves. It was love at first sight. For $50, Conroy bought the pair from Donald Hawes of Milford. Young and eager to embark on his new adventure with his first steers, he talked his dad into taking them home that night.Conroy didn't anticipate the daunting challenges he'd face. The calves were reluctant to follow him on the lead rope, and even more reluctant in the yoke. Neither of his parents could offer advice to their son, as they had never raised or trained oxen.&quot;Somehow, I managed to train Zeb and Luke. I suppose I was motivated by my father's insistence that we could always eat them if I didn't get them trained,&quot; says Conroy, jokingly. &quot;One of the greatest lessons I learned is that there's no substitute for time spent working with animals. I also learned the importance of communicating with people and learning from the experience of others.&quot;Twenty-one years later, Conroy is an animal science professor at the University of New Hampshire's Thompson School of Applied Science. His recently published book on training and working oxen now helps others interested in the &quot;lost art.&quot; Titled &quot;Oxen, a Teamsters Guide,&quot; the 345-page book includes information on every aspect of raising, training, driving, and showing the animals.It also includes many illustrations and photos, which include a number of well-known New Hampshire teamsters.Conroy has found a role in training individuals how to use oxen today on small farms and in international development. He has traveled as far away as Tanzania and Uganda in Africa to teach people about the productive use of oxen. He has also been involved as a consultant for the movie industry.&quot;The book emphasizes New England methods of training and working animals that can be applied anywhere, and at the same time describes how oxen are yoked, worked and used in the United States,&quot; says Conroy.The Berwick, Maine, resident wrote his first book, &quot;The Oxen Handbook,&quot; when he was a junior at UNH in 1985. It quickly became a reference for 4-H and adult teamsters everywhere. The new book expands on Conroy's first work. It covers the basics, from choosing the right breed and properly feeding and housing oxen, to correctly fitting a yoke and bow, to keeping oxen healthy.It also provides information for readers interested in using oxen for farming and logging, as well as competition.The book includes a chapter on oxen in history, as well. Conroy argues that without oxen, European settlers could not have survived in North America. Their role in farming the land and in westward expansion were paramount to developing this country.&quot;History changed with the beginning of farming and the domestication of animals,&quot; Conroy explains. &quot;Following centuries of human labor, the first draft animal put to work in early agriculture was the ox, which was used long before horse and other equine animals were domesticated. Oxen provided the draft power that helped create an agricultural revolution by allowing farmers to till more land, harvest crops in a timely manner, and transport crops and other goods in large quantities over great distances.&quot;According to Conroy, the first oxen were likely domesticated in southeastern Europe and western Asia, most likely in Greece and Turkey. Cattle husbandry in that region was common 7,000 years ago. Other than the domestication of the dog, domestication of cattle was the most important step in manipulating the animal world and exploiting the land for agricultural purposes. Cattle supplied the meat, milk, leather, manure and power for agriculture.In his book Conroy also discusses the use of cattle as draft animals in Third World countries today. Offering a living history lesson, he explains how the Maasai in East Africa continue to herd their cattle, as many early Asian and Eastern European cattle owners did.&quot;The Maasai and others like them in Africa are beginning to adopt more productive ways of farming their land, and oxen are an important part of that change,&quot; says Conroy. &quot;They are just beginning to face the trials of training and using oxen. In addition to the ox's most important role in plowing the land, they are also using this animal to transport manure, carry water and move materials from the forest to build fences and new homes. Observing these people and their use of oxen is like traveling back in time.&quot;Conroy says the primary audience for his book is New England people with oxen, 4-H groups, museums, and living history farms like Sturbridge Village in Massachusetts. But he also hopes it will find a niche among international development groups like the Peace Corps.&quot;There a more than 200 million oxen in the world today, mostly in Third World countries,&quot; Conroy says. &quot;So I hope it will somehow find its way into the hands of international development groups that can put it to good use.&quot;Conroy continues to own and train oxen today and his two new additions, a pair of four-year-olds named Rex and Ely, help himwork his 10-acre farm in Berwick.February 15, 2000"},{"Title":"Oxen: A Teamster's Guide","review":"Drew Conroy - the reigning leader in modern working cattle techniques has once again outdone himself.

My original edition is worn, torn, and marked due to loving usage. I expect soon this new edition will also have serious evidence of wear because the value of the book is in using it not merely reading it. That means sometimes it is in the field with me and the oxen and subject to the weather and whatever may happen when you take the oxen out for a stroll.I treasure this new book. The beautiful color photographs that illustrate this new edition make the subjects in the photos nearly jump off the page. I like best the insertion of stories about the lives of men who work oxen in America today. He calls these stories \\"On the Farm\\" they are like an oral history of the lore of oxen in America today. I noticed several men I have had the pleasure of speaking to myself, Howard van Ord from Pennsylvania and Tim Huppe from Berrybrook Ox Supply in New Hampshire. These stories help the reader understand the depth of feeling of the oxen teamster about his animals and his relationship to them.I am new to this business. I have driven oxen teams for only six years, so I value all the new information in Oxen, A Teamster's Guide more than most. This is almost an encyclopedia of knowledge on the subject of working cattle. Many of the drawings and black and white photographs from the first edition remain and that is good. I noticed many new drawings that help illustrate how to perform a particular function--the artist really captured the sense of what you have to do to make things work.I say bravo to the author for this wonderful instructional book. Every oxen man or woman will want to have his or her own copy of this impressive new edition. Every time I open the book I will offer a silent thank you to Drew Conroy and his family for making the effort to put into words some of his oxen wisdom.

Very important: he shows exactly how to measure for and build the yoke, which is important because yokes are not easy to find ready-made in some parts of the country. The author rates the breeds of cattle by tractability and size to help new teamsters get a good start. Oxen have some advantages for work on hobby farms or acreages compared to horses. They rarely run away, are less excitable, don't founder and do fine on juat average pasture.

Pecklers goes on to say that people might be honest generous, righteous, and inspired by the life of Jesus but if they never pray in common with other Christians they cannot rightfully claim the Christian identity. That is not a harsh exclusion. It is a simple fact because communal worship formed the cornerstone of the early Church (e.g. the last supper), was as a key factor during its history, and remains an integral part of Christian life today.The Greek word leitourgia, giving rise to the English &quot;liturgy&quot;, once had a secular meaning - literally &quot;work belonging to the people&quot;. It is used many times in the Greek version of Hebrew scripture (the Septuagint) and became associated with worship in the second century. The term came to signify service to both God and community giving clue to the relationship between Christ and his Church through the Christian community's charitable and ministerial roles within the context of worship.The formal study of liturgy - the symbols, rituals, forms and practices of worship as they fit into particular theological and cultural settings - is a relatively recent (20th century) phenomenon. Fr. Pecklers is a Rome based American Jesuit who has written extensively about the subject. He is widely traveled and his commentary is not limited to the Roman Catholic liturgy. For example he says when illustrating the necessary corporate nature of Christian worship, &quot;When the Christian community gathers together each Sunday it brings with it all that has transpired the previous week, both good and bad, 'what we have done and what we have left undone', as Anglicans pray in Confession of Sins found within the Book of Common Prayer.&quot;The first four chapters present sound theological and historical foundations proceeding from the Apostolic period to fourth century events, like the Edict of Milan (313), and through the Medieval period that included the innovation of elevating the host and chalice high overhead during the Eucharistic prayer (ca. 1200) that we see frequently even today. The effects of Reformation period events, like the Council of Trent (1545 - 63) and Thomas Cranmer's Book of Common Prayer (1549), on liturgical practice are discussed in detail. The history of this &quot;worship in transition&quot; is then traced into the twentieth century illustrated by such events as the Second Vatican Council (1962-65).The remaining four chapters introduce thematic, sociological, and cultural material ultimately raising questions about the future of worship in response to our changing world. The interaction of Christian worship with diverse cultures is examined - now called &quot;liturgical enculturation&quot;. We read a clear plea for flexibility within the context of theology. The relationship between corporate Christian worship and the popular religious practices of local peoples is discussed in some detail. We have learned much from our Latin neighbors in this regard and the lessons apply well to the needs of immigrants and others in foreign lands. The reasoning extends to arguments favoring a form of worship that is deeply connected to the plight of human society. We are now starting to understand that worship is an integral part of human life rather than being simply a matter of religious rubrics on the periphery of human society. The book concludes with a chapter raising questions about the future of Christian worship in a postmodern, multicultural world saying that, &quot;churches will have important decisions to make about how we worship, who leads us, who is 'worthy' to participate, and how corporate prayer connects to the rest of life.&quot;The book is informative, stimulating, well written and easy to read. It should appeal to anyone interested in or curious about the history of Christian worship and how it relates to human society."},{"Title":"Worship: A Primer in Christian Ritual","review":"Kieth Pecklers achieves a very thorough compilation of the long history, adaptation and reform of Christian Worship from a Roman Catholic viewpoint yet with sensitive attention to many forms of this worship from the first century onward. In eight well crafted chapters he captures the intensity of the early church, the insight of the Patristic era, the accretions of the Medieval period and the conflicts of the great Reforms of the 16th Century. He also offers clear insight into the many attempts at reform and revival of involvement of all the faithful that occurred in the 18th, 19th and eventually emerged at Vatican Council II in the 20th Century. He maintains a brisk pace for the person interested in getting a quick foundation while including frequent references for the more scholarly reader.

Pointing out inconsistencies by Thomas merely shows that he is not as ideologically based as his reputation. The book is largely a diatribe against Thomas and Scalia, Marcosson's other target. Marcosson fails to notice more inconsistency in the rulings of his hero, Justice Blackmun. He presents a pretentious argument with simplistic assumptions placed by the author in the minds of his targets bordering on fiction. A further flight of fancy reduces Bush v. Gore to the absurd 3x + 7 = 35.The book is somewhat salvaged by some good case history of the Commerce Clause and 14th amendment jurisprudence and judicial review. The logic of applying the BofR to the states is one sided and not very compelling. The negative aspects of reducing safeguards of the 9th and 10th Amendments are barely touched upon. I suspect that either Thomas or Scalia could make the counter arguments much more effectively. In listing the aims of his originalist opponents Marcosson neglects preservation of unenumerated rights as well as rights left to the states. Citing some socially beneficial rulings, Marcossen fails to observe the resulting expansion of government power or the attack on separation of powers in assuming the role of Congress to enact socially beneficial legislation. While a lot of socially beneficial legislation has been upheld, the sum total of activist court intervention has been a great expansion of federal power at the expense of state's rights and individual freedom.Marcosson fails to separate results from process as Thomas is attempting to do. The author's recommended process of \\"legitimization' involves a search for \\"taints\\" in the original Constitution. That shouldn't be a judicial function. While not previously a fan of Thomas and Scalia, the feeble logic of this ideological diatribe has exactly the opposite of the effect intended. The book should be titled 'Marcosson v.

It's not set in the same time but much later, in the Medieval Poland, a strange mix of civilisation (it was the only real democracy in those times' Europe - even the king was elected by poll!) and savagery. The Chistian Pollons - the most fervent of Catholics even now - of the Middle Eve show alternate sensibility and cruelty, are capable of the most gentle love but could butcher carelessly an opponent, are trustworthy or the biggest liars - and all of them breathe in the pages of this novel. You might have problems with the names - but this is to be expected; you don't have to learn Polish in order to love this book...Young \\"polkovnik\\" (equiv. colonel) Skrzetuski falls inlove with a panni (miss) he's only spoken to for a little time. The girl's guardians promise him the maiden's hand in marriage... But as soon as he's away , the Tartars destroy the mansion and all knowledge of the inhabitants is lost. Kept a prisoner by the Tartars, allied with the Kosaks, Skrzetuski is freed only to find his lover gone. The Kosak Bohun, also inlove with Helena, kidnaps the girl and carries her away. As much as he'd want to go to her rescue, Skrzetuski has military duties to fulfill and will go to war instead of finding his heart's desire. But as he desperately tries to put love aside (and never really succeeds) his loyal friends go in search of Helena. Pan Zagloba, the biggest braggart of all times, and young Michal Wollodijowski manage to rescue her from her keepers and even wound Bohun. But after they hide her in a monastery in a protected city, and give the good news to the delighted Skrzetuski, they learn that the city was overtaken by the enemies and the monasteries sacked, the maidens there raped and murdered. Devastated, the young colonel decides to try to find death as a hero or join a monks order, if he'll survive all battles...this is only the mainline and could tell nothing of the beauty of the prose...

Deluge. Fire in the Steppes. You can read it as an epic historical novel about 17th century Poland, and what an epic it is! I don't think Hollywood with its cast of thousands and all its money could tell this story vividly as did Sienkiewicz using only the printed word. Believe me, from page 1 you are there.But I wish this was the only reason to read this book.Unfortunately, you can't help noticing parallels with Poland then and the USA now, which are many and disquieting. Two constitutional politcal systems; one a republic, the other an elective monarchy--both relatively pluralistic and tolerant in hostile and violent time. Circling foreign powers. Short sighted quarreling and wrangling among the leaders. A huge border problem; large and less than 100% loyal minorities. Holding all this in check are massively powerful militaries. In Poland's case, this wasn't enough. Poland so exhausted itself fighting internal rebellions and foreign invasions that it was easy prey for partitioning in the next century.So it's a good old fashioned read and a very sobering read at the same time."},{"Title":"With Fire and Sword, Vol. 1","review":"For students of East-European history, a sort of thoughtful GONE WITH THE WIND with footnotes. This Victorian-era, historical romance belongs to an eminent tradition that begins with Walter Scott, a tradition that includes Victor Hugo, Dumas (here the main influence), Pushkin, Tolstoi, etc., etc. Of special note, for a fuller perspective on the subject--the unraveling in the 17c of the grand Polish empire (\\"commonwealth\\")--read Gogol's Ukranian perspective in TARAS BULBA (made into a silly Hollywood movie, naturellement, with Yul Brynner and Tony Curtis), Isaac Singer's Polish-Jewish lament in SATAN IN GORAY (calamities effectuate religious enthusiasm, or haven't you noticed?), Daniel Defoe's Anglo-gloating in MEMOIRS OF A CAVALIER, and even Isaac Babel's RED CAVALRY (does the horror of the plunder scene in Kosinski's PAINTED BIRD plunder the gleeful horrors in Sienkiewicz's narrative?; the latter never misses an impalement). The treatment, by the author of QUO VADIS?, would eventually inform Hollywood's world-view: super heroes, super damsels in eminent distress, super villains and sort-of villains (unlike Hollywood, the author follows the aristocratic tradition of granting a brave and skillful enemy his due), no sex (save \\"Tartar fashion\\"), and lots and lots of blood and guts (literally; after all, this is East Europe). As I said, Hollywood. Essential reading--along with THE DELUGE (mighty!! Sweden picks on sweet, peace-loving Poland) and FIRE IN THE STEPPE (the mighty Turk picks on peace-loving Western civilization)--for students of European history, especially of East European. The collapse of Poland in the 17c would lead to the rise of two great European powers--Germany via Prussia, and Romanoff Russia. In tone and theme WITH FIRE AND SWORD prepares the reader for 20c European history. Incidentally, tho written by a Polish patriot in the 19c, there is very little of the religious issue either as it may have been felt in Poland or as it helped precipitate the war (rebellion) in the Ukraine (the lords of Poland failed to show sensitivity to the religious sensibilities of Cossacks): a curious omission in a portrait of Eastern Europe in the 17c (but compare with the sequel, THE DELUGE, wherein the shoe is on the other foot). Another aside: Sienkowiewicz's persistent adoration of the decorums of feudalism as a 19c romantic imagined them, tho risible to a 21st century North American (and quite sinister and ominous, unless one trusts NPR), is somewhat in a European tradition that would endure until, and thro, the Great War (WW I); think of Tennyson's \\"kind hearts and coronets\\" or read the boys magazines published in England, 1914 - 1918 (or watch Masterpiece Theatre). To cite just one example from our author: on the eve of battle with Sweden's army (in THE DELUGE), the inert, effete Polish nobility (according to the author) suddenly pulses as one with that \\"inborn capacity of the nobles for war.\\" (For an eminent rejoinder, read Conrad's LORD JIM.) As I said, somewhat risible but sinister and ominous from a contemporary perspective up here. Rendered in a lively, brisk, popular style well suited to the magazine serialization that marked the book's first appearance (as with Dickens). Quite early on the author's works achieved canonicity in Polish letters and literature (criticise at your peril). As a young man Stienkiewicz crossed America (shortly after the Civil War), and his published reflections on the new republic remain trenchant and pertinent (and, on at least one subject, politically incorrect)."},{"Title":"With Fire and Sword, Vol. 1","review":"This book, and its two sibling books \\"The Deluge\\" and \\"Fire in the Steppe,\\" were recommended to me by a Polish person because they were \\"good stories.\\" What I found were three of the most gripping pieces of literature I have ever read.

I had seen the movie Quo Vadis long ago. When I came across the title and learned that he had won the Nobel prize, I decided to give the book a try. I know nothing about the civil wars that were a part of the period and compounding that lack of knowledge with a litany of very unfamiliar names, the battle scenes for me were difficult to get through. HOWEVER, the more personal story of the the two lovers and the princess' flight to avoid a barbaric lover,and the individual profiles of various warriors and their relationships was extremely interesting. The descriptions of the lands after the battles gave a graphic picture of the grotesque nature of the people at that time. The descriptions of the superstitious nature that played an integral part of these peoples's lives created, as well, a tone that many modern authors fail to achieve.

If it turns out to be an apocalyptic, utopian vision wherein all are (voluntarily or involuntarily) made to hold hands and sing Kumbaya, or worse, an ode to the all powerful nanny state, then I most vociferously must object. I would not go in for totalitarianism, whether from the left or right (politically), secular or religious. If they want a revolution, like the Beatles, they can count me out! After all, the only genuine revolutionary is the God of Love, Jesus the Christ. Love, of course, meaning to desire the objective good of the other. I suspect that all leftist and \\"progressive\\" thought is merely trying to escape God and His Love. If one succeeds in this attempted escape, Hell is where they land...eternally. What is most puzzling is that they have the audacity, when this is suggested, to blame a \\"cruel, vindictive god\\". Notice I have neglected to capitalize the G in God. Even if they don't understand, those who reject God eternally, will still have a \\"god\\" and it is the \\"god of this world\\" and Satan certainly can be a cruel task master.As to the book, I highly recommend it. It is, in my opinion, (outside of The Screwtape Letters) C.S. Lewis' best fiction. I know some may reject my claim and make an opposing claim for the Chronicles of Narnia. However, in my opinion, the allegory is a tad to thick for my tastes. That Hideous Strength is a masterpiece for fiction from a Theistic reference point. C.S. Lewis was able integrate his non-fiction philosophy along with a compelling storyline and likeable (or detestable) characters. It must be said that Mr. Lewis is not a master of verbal caricature (like Dickens), symbolism (like Hawthorne), or even fantastical descriptions (like Tolkien). That being said, That Hideous Strength is a fast-moving (even more so if one has read the other two novels in this trilogy), enjoyable fantasy/scientific novel that could not be more relevant for our times.Finally, I suspect leftists, atheists, and \\"progressives\\" hate this novel due to the fact that it exposes them."},{"Title":"That hideous strength,: A modern fairy-tale for grown-ups","review":"\\"That Hideous Strength\\" is the 3rd and final book in C.S. Lewis' space trilogy. Although \\"That Hideous Strength\\" takes place entirely on Earth, supernatural elements from the first two books make an appearance in this one.Anytime a book (such as this one) makes me underline passages on nearly every page and anytime a book makes me stop to think about ideas or care about the characters or re-read passages for the sheer delight they bring, I know I've just read a classic.While difficult and dense at times, \\"That Hideous Strength\\" is a classic that should provoke an enlightening joy in its readers!Lewis called his book \\"A fairy tale for grown ups,\\" which is actually a pretty good summary of the whole thing. What Lewis attempts (and mostly achieves) is to represent the invisible spiritual realities through the ordinary, humdrum things of the world. As in fairy tales, \\"That Hideous Strength\\" starts out with the ordinary but ends up in the most extraordinary way.I won't ruin the plot for those who haven't read it, but Lewis primarily deals with the life of a married couple, Mark and Jane Studdock. It's important that the novel begins with marriage, refers to marriage throughout, and ends with marriage. While marriage, especially one like the Studdock's, may seem humdrum, it is, in reality, a profound spiritual picture of both the union between Christ and the Church and of the union of love that is to exist among men.When I recently taught \\"That Hideous Strength\\" to a high school class in Apologetics at the classical Anglican school where I teach, I had them read the book through the lens of \\"influence,\\" \\"peer pressure,\\" and \\"motivations.\\" As you read the book, pay attention to why Mark and Jane acts the way they do, who influences them, and what their motivations are. Lewis has given us a profound imaginative look at how our lives are really governed. This book ended up being the perfect companion to my Apologetics class in which I tried to get my students to see the necessity of every Christian giving an account of the hope that is within them. We've also spent a lot of time this year talking about peer pressure and how it can lead Christians closer to or further away from God.Another way of reading \\"That Hideous Strength\\" is to look at it through the lens of the different worldviews that are presented. Among these are the unthinking atheism of Mark, the selfish practical atheism and individualism of Jane, the modernistic dream of human reason, a more postmodern mix of reason and the occult, and Christianity. It's fascinating to see the war of the worldviews at work in \\"That Hideous Strength\\"! Lewis clearly understood the spiritual state of England in 1946, and his analysis of that condition continues to have relevance for the Western world in the 21st century. Lewis' fairy tale succeeds in alerting his readers to the very real presence of the supernatural in our ordinary lives.One of the things that make the book such a joy to read is Lewis' insight into human nature. While the \\"I\\" passages of the book are unnecessarily obtrusive, Lewis nevertheless gives the reader a lot of keen insight into the nature of man, the nature of marriage, and the psychology that lies behind our thoughts and actions.Another sumptuous part of the novel is Lewis' language. As with so many of his other works, he has many quotable lines from either the characters or the narrators. At other times, a lyrical beauty sings through the passages, such as those where he describes the effects that earthly characters feel when in the presence of the eldil or angels.Even the plot itself, filled with most fantastic twists and turns and bizarre occurrences, will not only delight but also shock the reader into wanting to read until the consummation of events in the final chapter.Finally, I find Lewis' injection of not only Merlin but also Arthurian mythology to be not only out of place but also a positive distraction from the Christian meaning and symbolism of the rest of the novel. It's almost as if Lewis, being the classical and medieval scholar he was, couldn't help himself. It makes for fascinating reading, but it's not entirely favorable in its effect.In spite of a few odd things I didn't care for, \\"That Hideous Strength\\" remains a wonder and delight that I highly recommend to serious readers, especially those who are Christian."},{"Title":"That hideous strength,: A modern fairy-tale for grown-ups","review":"In 2004, I decided to begin reading through C.S. Lewis' \\"Space Trilogy.\\" I loved the first book, Out of the Silent Planet. Lewis turned upside down my expectations, as he imagined how sin would affect (or not affect) life on other planets. In 2005, I read the second book in the series, Perelandra. While I did not enjoy the second as much as the first, I recognized and appreciated Lewis' literary genius in recasting the Adam and Eve story.It took four years to get around to the third book in Lewis' trilogy. That Hideous Strength is quite different than the first two. All the action takes place on Earth. The book is about twice as long as the others. And the main character from the other books doesn't appear until midway through the story. This work reminds me of 1984, except that it starts out much slower and ends up with an explicitly Christian interpretation. I enjoyed parts of this book, particularly the ways in which Lewis pointed out the ease with which men of the academy can be led astray by the desire for popularity. But That Hideous Strength was my least favorite of the trilogy."},{"Title":"That hideous strength,: A modern fairy-tale for grown-ups","review":"This is one of my favorite books of all time. I have read a number of the negative reviews, and I can see how someone who doesn't share the religious views of Lewis might be put off. If a reader is not at all open to the possibility of the supernatural then this book might be tough going. But for anyone who has wondered, \\"How might a political conspiracy actually take place?\\", this is a must read. Whatever religious or political views one holds, to think that the main stream media is not even the least bit managed from \\"up top\\" is naive."},{"Title":"That hideous strength,: A modern fairy-tale for grown-ups","review":"I wish I had time to give this a little longer review, because there's so much packed into this final story in the Ransom (or Space) Trilogy. Perhaps the most interesting thing is the way Lewis blurs genre throughout the series. You can call the whole series \\"science fiction,\\" but that's not quite accurate. It best describes the first book Out of the Silent Planet , which Lewis writes as science fiction in the vein of H.G. Wells'The War of the Worlds, but with the intention of communicating a medieval cosmology. The second book Perelandra reads more like a myth. In many ways it's a re-imagining of Milton'sParadise Lost, except in this case, Paradise Retained. That Hideous Strength is a fairy tale, or romance. It's full of academic satire, Arthurian legend, and a critique of scientism and theological liberalism.It's the longest of the three books (longer than the first two combined), and it starts rather slowly. But it's worth trudging through the first 50 pages or so to get into the plot. The characters are thin (that's pretty normal for a fairy tale), but the focus is not in character development, but in ideas and ideologies and the battle between good and evil.Recommended for anyone interested in theology, medieval worldview, Arthurian legend, fairy tales for adults."},{"Title":"That hideous strength,: A modern fairy-tale for grown-ups","review":"C.S. Lewis has always been a favorite author of mine, and his \\"Space Trilogy\\" has always piqued my interest. However, I was never able to find it in bookstores or in libraries. I can understand some reasons why now that I've read the whole series, however, I still find it a travesty.This book, like the other books in the trilogy, take a while to get going, and this is by far the longest of the three, which means an even longer intro. However, the plot, once you start to realize what it is, plunges you into an epic battle between good and evil, right here in our world. The epic final confrontation so struck me that I am still having dreams about it, even weeks after I've finished reading the book.That being said, there are some things the average person should know. This book is not like his Narnia series. The writing and ideas are closer to \\"The Screwtape Letters\\" or \\"Mere Christianity\\" than they are to \\"The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe\\" or \\"Prince Caspian.\\" However, if you are of a more mature audience, and especially if you liked his previous novel in the trilogy \\"Perelandra,\\" you'd definitely enjoy this novel.While it isn't necessary to read the two preceding novels in the trilogy to understand this one, things make a lot more sense and the story is much richer because of it.Overall, a good read for those who grew up with Narnia, but are now more grown-up themselves."},{"Title":"That hideous strength,: A modern fairy-tale for grown-ups","review":"This is the third book in C. S. Lewis's science fiction trilogy. These books get progressivley more detailed, theological, \\"heady\\" as the series goes on. I think I would say that this is my favorite of the three, perhaps because it sums up the story of Elwin Ransom that was started in \\"Out of the Silent Planet\\", or perhaps because it is just plain the weirdest out of the three. It has a rather gory ending, which is not to my personal taste, but the story ends very satisfactorily. I totally recommend the whole series, but this book especially is not for children. Also, it is not \\"light\\" reading, and takes some concentration and perseverance. Absolutely worth reading, if you like this genre and/or author. I would also receommend reading the three books in order."},{"Title":"That hideous strength,: A modern fairy-tale for grown-ups","review":"\\"That hideous strength\\" is a science fiction/fantasy novel by British writer C.S. Lewis, otherwise mostly known for his children's tales about Narnia. Lewis wrote a \\"space trilogy\\" for adults, of which \\"That hideous strength\\" is the concluding part. The novels of the trilogy can be read independently of each other.The plot of the novel revolves around a secret, evil brotherhood. The brotherhood, known as NICE, are a kind of anti-humanist, technology-worshipping Satanists. Their ostensible goal is to give humans eternal life through some kind of cloning. NICE probably symbolize the evils of modern, industrial civilization (and its enchanting allure). Their real goal is, in effect, the abolition of man. The rituals of NICE are based on conspiracy theories about secret Templar and Masonic rituals. Indeed, there is a strong atmosphere of conspiracy thinking in the novel. I'm surprised that it's almost never referenced by conspiracy theorists. Of course, the conspiracism is a literary device. There is nothing in Lewis' non-fiction indicating that he believed in conspiracies. Once again, my guess is that NICE is a symbol of modern science gone mad, and modernity in general being turned against humanity.Lewis was a fairly conservative Christian, and \\"That hideous strength\\" is therefore imbued with a Christian message and various supernatural elements. The scientists of NICE, at least initially, believe that they have cracked the secret of immortality through scientific means. In reality, their bizarre laboratory has been taken over by demons! NICE are challenged by a small group of Christians, led by the mysterious Elwin Ransom, who always reminded me of Jesus. Another supernatural character is the wizard Merlin. More annoying are the patriarchal elements of the story: marriage is for life, women should obey their husbands, and so on. Ransom is a pretty bad marriage counsellor! Another disturbing kind of Christian morality comes across when Merlin exclaims: \\"I'm not immoral. The only people I ever killed were heathen Saxons\\". So that makes it alright, then?Still, my main problem with \\"That hideous strength\\" isn't the conservative Christian message. Obviously, a Christian writer will write Christian books. The novel goes somewhat astray on two other points. First, there is a disconnect between the first part of the novel (almost a suspense thriller) and the second part, where Lewis introduces elements of Arthurian romance and a unexpected cross-over with the novels of J.R.R. Tolkien (!). I don't mind supernatural elements in sci fi novels, but these feel like the wrong kinds of supernatural elements. A charismatic revival is thrown in for good measure at the end, presumably as a foretaste of the apocalypse. Once again, the reader is left wondering what on earth is going on...The other problem I have is that Lewis somehow wanted to write a novel about pretty much everything. The introduction of a bear in the story becomes an opportunity to preach against pantheism. On another page, Lewis discusses various ways of approaching a spiritual conversion experience. And what attitude should true Christians have towards the House of Windsor? Stay tuned for a theologically correct answer. Rather than developing two or three (Christian) themes, Lewis wants to develop them all. It's almost as if he forgot that he was writing a novel, rather than a non-fiction book!That being said, I nevertheless found \\"That hideous strength\\" interesting, even intriguing. The criticism of mad science, phoney progress and secret elites was particularly interesting. As a secular \\"leftist\\", I presumably criticize society from almost exactly the opposite vantage point compared to a conservative Anglican.Still, it can hardly be denied that \\"science\\" and \\"progress\\" untempered with morality are...evil."},{"Title":"That hideous strength,: A modern fairy-tale for grown-ups","review":"This is the third and concluding book in Lewis's \\"Cosmic Trilogy\\". In it, Professor Ransom, the protagonist of the first two tales, is a secondary (but vital) character. This story, unlike the first two, which range from Mars to Venus, takes place in then-contemporary England, at a small university.It is, like the others, a not-very-subtle moral allegory; in fact, it is so direct that it is scarcely an allegory at all. It is frightening, in a literal sense, to realize that the over-the-top caricatures Lewis uses for his \\"bad guys\\" are become, in our times, so close to plausible as to give one the chills.As ever, Lewis ends up with a hammer-banging delivery of his moral, but the entire tale is so surreal that it scarcely harms the telling.The book is decent reading on its own, and essential if you have read the two that come before it."},{"Title":"That hideous strength,: A modern fairy-tale for grown-ups","review":"I start with a quibble. Lewis's preface states, \\"If you ask why - intending to write about magicians, devils, pantomime animals, and planetary angels - I nonetheless begin with such hum-drum scenes and persons, I reply that I am following the traditional fairytale. We do not always notice its methods, because the cottages, castles, woodcutters and petty kings with which a fairytale opens have become for us as remote as the witches and ogres to which it proceeds. But they were not remote at all to the men who made and first enjoyed the stories.\\" Lewis demonstrates a basic misunderstanding here, which can be cured by reading a hundred folktales in a row and noting the opening sentences: \\"Once, in another kingdom, not in this place ...\\"; \\"Once upon a time ...\\"; \\"Long ago in a galaxy far, far away ...\\" The air of what we now call social realism is banished with the very first sentence, and the \\"hum-drum\\" beginning is a more complex thing than Lewis imagines it to be.But my quibble is more than just a quibble, for it illustrates the basic failure of \\"That Hideous Strength\\". Lewis tries to blend the fantastic with the everyday, yes. But he also throws in a sort of creepy science fiction, Christianity, Arthurian legend, dystopia, and several other things besides, and the result is not a blend but a salad.The truth is, none of the books in the Cosmic trilogy quite comes off. The first is a kind of satire of H.G. Wells, which makes a hollow \\"ping\\" if you strike it. The second (and best) is a pure fantasy which happens to be set on Venus (just as a fantasy might be set in Ancient Greece or on a deserted island), which preaches just a little too much. And the third ... well, we return to the world of H.G. Wells (with a highly unfair and unflattering caricature of the man himself), but we also have pure Perelandran fantasy, and these two flavours clash all by themselves - never mind what else is in the book. And speaking of caricatures, there is MacPhee, an annoying cardboard portrait of an old tutor of Lewis's, who was himself, as far as I can tell, made of cardboard. (A much rounder portrait in the same vein is the Fox, in Lewis's \\"Till We Have Faces\\" - in every way a better book.)HOWEVER ... I liked it. Individual scenes don't work together, but they frequently work. The narrative thread of the endearingly unendearing Mark Studdock is a worthwhile book in itself. It's hard, all said and done, to find a reader who doesn't enjoy this book.The Cosmic trilogy as a whole, however, must be written off as a failed experiment, by a writer who could do much better. In the following decade, he did."},{"Title":"That hideous strength,: A modern fairy-tale for grown-ups","review":"This is the worst (and final) book of Lewis' space trilogy. Here, his apparent lack of forethought and organization culminate in \\"That Hideous Strength\\" where Lewis seems to drift aimlessly among topics of space travel and other worlds, to British monarchistic nationalism, Arthurian legends, angelology, human psychology, reincarnation, mad scientists, and marriage life.In short, while I enjoyed \\"Out of the Silent Planet\\" and gained some pleasure from Perelandra, this final book was a horrible amalgamation of aimless themes, lacked a concise plot, and left the reader (at least this reader) disappointed."},{"Title":"That hideous strength,: A modern fairy-tale for grown-ups","review":"Firstly let me say I'm an atheist; I find all religious beliefs to be rather silly.However this book (even more than its predecessors) is awful. It's not so much about Lewis's religious beliefs as about his politics and personal life; the whole thing is a huge compendium of Blimpish Tory ranting against anything vaguely liberal in Britain post-1945. Far and away Lewis's worst and most infuriating book. It is also embarrassingly, offensively, sexist (\\"Write no more books, have children instead\\").There is quite a lot of messed up sexism in the whole trilogy, even more so than Lewis's work in general. It seems to (mainly) boil down to a lot of the \\"essentialist male = closer to God\\" nonsense and monarchy-worship (Lewis was an ardent monarchist and distrusted democracy, as shown in this and other books).It seems to me that Lewis (to paraphrase Patricia Schroder) was scared by the whole notion of a woman who has a brain and a uterus.Lewis must have been going through a pretty bad time personally during and right after the war, to write such a bizarre, mean-spirited, book. Perhaps it's more about Lewis's own doubts, and his reaction to the general loss of religious faith caused by the war, as the book seems to be written to bolster his *own* faith.Also the book is downright illogical in it's perception of god (e.g. the Merlin character's pronouncements against Jane for using birth control; obviously Lewis's god couldn't cope with a diaphragm.......). If this is God's will, that we be governed by the apparent mentality of a sulky child, then indeed it is a toss-up which side is good and which evil"},{"Title":"That hideous strength,: A modern fairy-tale for grown-ups","review":"It's an old book as the cover and the pages are quite brittle.

The bad and the ugly: Lewis' writing style is haphazard at best--names changed sporadically without reason, numerous misspellings, random pieces of linguistic bravado which would be quite unintelligible to most readers, there was even a chapter, told in the first person, which so lost me that I still have no clue of the speaker's identity. There is nothing likable or interesting about most characters. Following the plot for the first half of the book is like slamming your head into a wall over and over and over and over... Instead of characters or a compelling storyline driving the narrative, this contains lengthy chapters of bone-numbing dialog, hopeless exposition, deus ex machina, and spontaneous, overly-complex descriptions. The conclusion was drawn out, confused, and hardly satisfying except for the fact that the good guys won (which we knew would happen anyway). The worst part is that one could catch glimpses of so many fabulous and compelling stories and characters just under the surface that would have made this an incredible novel had they been told and focused on instead.

While the sci-fi purist concept of a 'corporation' taking over and essentially looking to sterilize the planet and 'create the superior being' is well founded, Dr. Ransom's character really does little in this book other than 'sit and wait' for the higher forces to come to put a stop to it. The addition of Merlin was interesting insomuch as his dialog with Dr. Ransom, but the way in which he is sent to resolve the conflict at hand is a bit much, and to be honest entirely to grusome. Also, there is really little to no reason to empathize with the character of Mark, and Lewis' treatment of Jane is typically patriarchal to the point of (personal) insult. Even the fact that her name is &quot;jane&quot; (very non-entity-like) compared to &quot;Mark&quot; (apostle), is a bit much. But of course, that was part of the 'message' I was supposed to receive I suppose (being a female reader)."},{"Title":"That hideous strength,: A modern fairy-tale for grown-ups","review":"The literary disaster that ends Lewis' 'Space Trilogy'.Unlikeable or unconvincing good guys, cardboard villains, and a wandering plot could not be spruced up into anything interesting, either by a surprise visit from an historical Merlin, reanimated human body parts, or even a grown bear thrown in as a full-fleged party member.Lewis over-reached himself in this one. Be a big Lewis fan and brew a big pot of coffee if you plan on finishing it.Better to read Til We Have Faces, if you're looking for some readable and thoughtful adult fiction by Lewis."},{"Title":"That hideous strength,: A modern fairy-tale for grown-ups","review":"Don't waste your time on this unmittigatedly boring tripe.

That Hideous Strength is a bit harder to get through, but well worth the time spent reading it."},{"Title":"That hideous strength,: A modern fairy-tale for grown-ups","review":"I enjoyed the book, although I can't call it an easy read. The persistence required to read it reminded me of reading \\"Atlas Shrugged\\". Time was needed between courses to digest what was presented and to appreciate what was next. I would think that one who would read this book would get a different message depending on what their experiences are to date, although this is true for many books, \\"That hideous strength\\" is in an elite category. I think it will be a different book the next time I read it.As for the message, I will not go and bore the reader with my impression. Written over 60 years ago, much like \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" the message is transcending and also much like Rand's masterpiece, I'll read it many times."},{"Title":"That hideous strength,: A modern fairy-tale for grown-ups","review":"This is a fascinating book and story that must be read all the way through book three in the series to be truly understood. Once I realized what it was truly about, it became much easier to wade through the diversions that are set up with too much going on about minute details and the thoughts of the characters. More action would have pleased me but I guess I am just accustomed to the masters of those kinds of books.One needs to remember that it was written so long ago that the prose is, to me, cumbersome and Lewis goes on and on about things philosophizing at great length about the smallest issue. I felt I had to stick with it in spite of this because by the time I began to see this, I had already invested too much time in the reading of it.I enjoyed this last book in the series more than the first two."},{"Title":"That hideous strength,: A modern fairy-tale for grown-ups","review":"As author of Project 314, I have a deep appreciation for the way that Lewis pits good vs. evil. In his space trilogy, Lewis ranks with Stephen King (The Stand), and Tolkien's ring series in the way that he reaches deeply into his imagination to allegorize the moral dilemma of man. From a scientific standpoint he is ahead of his time. Imagine Lewis' amazement at the way we keep bodies alive today!"},{"Title":"That hideous strength,: A modern fairy-tale for grown-ups","review":"A great, fun &quot;fairy tale&quot; with lots of meaning-Long live Merlin!"},{"Title":"That hideous strength,: A modern fairy-tale for grown-ups","review":"While not as good Perelandra, That Hideous Strength is certainly worth reading. Although the first ~40 pages are confusing and a little boring, the story quickly begins to pick up when the frightening designs of the N.I.C.E. are revealed. Mark, a young sociologist at a British University is offered a higher position with N.I.C.E., a sort-of-facade organization with a dark social agenda. Most interesting is the progression of thought by which Mark realizes his humanist or materialist presuppositions can lead to some shocking conclusions if followed through to their extreme. Intertwined are several connected storylines that sometimes delay the suspense of various climaxes within the story. While this was somewhat annoying, Lewis's witty writing kept me intrigued. Overall it was interesting how Lewis wove together philosophy with fantasy, and I was amused at his reference to Tolkien's land of Numinor as a historical reality."},{"Title":"That hideous strength,: A modern fairy-tale for grown-ups","review":"As a story, That Hideous Strength is of a lesser calibre than Out of the Silent Planet or Perelandra, the other books in the Cosmic Trilogy.

This final book (in his acclaimed \\"space trilogy\\") introduces readers to a brilliant mundaneness--a setting where both nothing and everything could happen simultaneously. It is a sleepy, stubborn, stubbornly sleepy novel that awakens to the furious dawn of Lewis's imagery and insight. Lewis has once again shown himself to be an excellent writer but more shocking than that...a eerily accurate kind of prognosticator. Futurity meets creativity in this work!"},{"Title":"That hideous strength,: A modern fairy-tale for grown-ups","review":"Shall I throw this book across the room because its plot hinges on forcing its heroine to accept her &quot;proper role&quot; as a woman in the mainstream Christianity of the era in which Lewis wrote it? Or shall I enjoy it on its own terms? I had to make up my mind about that as soon as I realized where the author was taking me, and at that point I put it aside overnight. With bookmark removed, because I intended to return it whence it was borrowed without reading further.I found my place again the next evening, and I kept on. I'm glad I did. While certainly I didn't wind up persuaded that birth control is an evil that prevents &quot;preordained&quot; conceptions from taking place, nor did I buy for a minute the notion that Jane Studdock could only gain both salvation and happiness by abandoning her doctoral thesis for a life of childbearing, I found the rest of the book thoroughly entertaining as a dark science fantasy. Lewis's wit more than redeems the rather heavy-handed allegory that the plot doesn't pretend to cloak. He takes myth and Christian doctrine, and settings and characters from his own time and place, and weaves it all together into a fast-moving and memorable tale. If he had only known the first thing about women, instead of sounding always like a bachelor uncle...or if only, as in &quot;Out of the Silent Planet,&quot; he'd had the good sense not to attempt writing them as major characters."},{"Title":"That hideous strength,: A modern fairy-tale for grown-ups","review":"I advanced as you're supposed to through this trilogy of works, and found as I read them they became more compelling and each better than the one before it. Currently my favourite fictional work is 'Perelandra,' which is the second book in the trilogy.This work does start out slowly but upon re-reading it one can see that it is indeed compelling from the get go and rife with the themes and turmoil which become widely apparent later in the novel. One should try to not be so intellectually inept as to not see what is going on until after the character in the book you're reading does, try in the beginning and realise that this work is a critique on various social events and systems which have arisen in modern history; Multiculturalism/Immigration, Feminism, Materialism, Intellectual slavery/Censorship, and Fascism as well as Statist points of view in general.This work shows the importance of family, proper social order and personal liberty and intellectual freedom. It is a darker genre than you may be used to, but as we live in dark times so why should this novel of a prophet who only saw what was being sown has not lived truly through what we're reaping be any different? Truly this is compelling and really engaged me as a person to question the question of gender relations (although this is not the defining work on such an issue). This work also I found to really touch on the collective unconsciousness of my heritage and has many mythos and folkish aspects which I loved. Truly it is a culmination of the trilogy albeit a break from the pace of the rest as the old favourite - Dr. Ransom is not the main character he's just a supplementary one. The fact is that it really did anger me that he wasn't the major character in the book but it's nice to see how one as advanced as Ransom can influence for the sake of their spirit the lost around him. So there is a lot to say for this book, and truly it is an intellectual, spiritual, and fantastic experience to say the least."},{"Title":"That hideous strength,: A modern fairy-tale for grown-ups","review":"Having enjoyed this novel again and again for a generation, I believe that it is prophetic and even more relevant today than when it was written. Now that recent filmings of Lord of the Ring and the first Narnia book have delighted critics and the public alike, is it too much to hope for a high-quality cinematic version someday of _That Hideous Strength_? Lewis would be most pleased, I daresay, if any such adaptation were set in our own time, because we need its messsage now.By the time Mark Studdock arrives at Belbury, he is a confirmed brown-nose with considerable experience in pursuing his life's ambition: joining the esoteric Inner Circle of whatever. It is striking, then, how much difficulty he has in the NICE even determining who is in this group. Feverstone, Filostrato, Hardcastle, and Straik, for instance, all confide to him that their own respective purviews are of the institute's essence, while various other departments are peripheral or merely for public consumption. By the end of the book, the chaos proclaims that none of these figures, nor anyone else, is effectively in charge.In this respect, Lewis brilliantly anticipated insights that the late William Stringfellow would articulate in the 1960s and 70s: that institutions are among the contemporary world's most characteristic manifestations of the demonic \\"powers and principalities\\" mentioned in the Bible. They inevitably take on lives of their own and go off the rails. Eventually they justify any and all means towards the end of their own survival and hegemony. They enslave and \\"deplete the personhood of\\" every human being involved with them-- even (and perhaps especially) those who imagine that they are in control.Of course, the church as an institution being hardly exempt from these problems, clergy would react to Stringfellow's analysis with hostility proportionate to their power. Ironically, the works of this theologian long lay in unread obscurity in seminary: while students in, of all places, law school continued to turn to them when they wanted to learn how corporate structures really operate. As we 21st-century Americans find ourselves steeped in the waking nightmare of an unfolding vindication of Stringfellow's prophetic thought, it is heartening at least to see a growing interest in it-- books lately republished and his ideas taken up and further developed e.g. by Walter Wink. For an illustrative novel, however, _That Hideous Strength_, written by C.S. Lewis some 25 years earlier, may yet be unsurpasssed.Some commentators have incomprehensibly indicated that the NICE people were materialists. Pas du tout. They are probably ex-materialists, but by the time we meet them are devotees of the occult. The reader grasps the inevitability of this progression. As Muggeridge (and perhaps Chesterton earlier) observed, those who cease to believe in God don't believe in nothing. Rather, before long they'll believe in anything. Lewis must have been aware of the occult dabbling practiced by high-level Nazi figures. While there are always atheistic individuals, it is unlikely, despite their best efforts, that their grandchildren will inherit a trait that requires so much mental assiduity to maintain. There have been no viable large atheistic societies. The Belburians, however, present themselves as materialists and are not prepared, and would probably never be prepared, to publicize their real allegiance: it is esoteric, elite, and exclusive by its very nature, not to be shared by the likes of you and me.Sitting in the garden, one of them exclaims, \\"Bloody racket those birds make!\\" Such a sentiment is revealing and chacteristic of one who, as the novel describes in detail, far from being a materialist, has cultivated a disgust for all things physical and who dreams of transcending it. Add this trait to a quest for esoteric knowledge and we have the two most classic marks of the gnostic.I have no doubt that Lewis intended the book partly as a warning against this mode of thought, which Christian orthodoxy has found profoundly and decisively incompatible. He illustrates what kind of people are tempted to take it up, why they do so, and to what bad ends it will lead. Since Lewis's death, it has become fashionable among post-modernists and certain feminists to express their pique and scorn for Christianity by affecting a sympathetic reconsideration of gnosticism, suggesting that its eclipse was only an historical accident or the effect of a political power play. We could do with this book as an antidote."},{"Title":"That hideous strength,: A modern fairy-tale for grown-ups","review":"Silly heading, but nobody reads them anyway. I think. The third and last book in the trilogy (you did read the others, right?) and about as far from science fiction as you can possibly get . . . there's a definite shift, Lewis seems to be bringing in more fantasy and religious allegorical elements as the series continued, with the end result here. The tale is subtitled &quot;A Fairy Tale for Grown-Ups&quot; and that's what it boils down to. If you're like me, you'll have read this right after reading the other two books (which were great, by the way) and you'll be immediately confused. Instead of focusing on the nifty Dr Ransom, you get a young couple Mark and Jane. Jane's having weird dreams that keep coming true and Mark isn't really paying attention because he's trying to get into the political &quot;circles&quot; as the local university where he works. However, little does he know that evil is lurking there and the folks are plotting some very dark things. Herein comes the good guys and after being introduced to lots o' supporting characters, some of which are interesting, some less so, you finally meet the man himself: Ransom. The problem I have, and this has been said elsewhere, is that he's apparently the &quot;Pendragon&quot; (but also the Fisher King . . . weren't they two different people?) but there's absolutely no explanation as to how that happened. Lewis probably figured it wasn't important and not relevant to the story itself, heck, Ransom's discussion of how he inherited the mantle of the Pendragon is basically tossed off in one sentence. The first half of the book mostly focuses on the college and the dread blokes there, but when Ransom and company shows up finally, things get very trippy indeed. Perelandra was a strange novel because of setting but I could deal with that, Lewis piles so much allegory on the plot that it gets almost ridiculous. And then Merlin shows up. That's right. Merlin. He's kinda fun actually but much like Ransom becomes, he's little more than a voice, you don't get any indication of his motivations. All that said though, this is a nifty way to end the series, the climax left me a little flat, especially after the buildup in the first two books (Merlin makes some stuff happen and the gods blow some stuff up) but Lewis' mastery of the English language saves this completely, this guy was passionate about this novel and you can tell, it crackles from every page and you can really feel it toward the end in almost every word. There's a nice &quot;Britishness&quot; about the book as well, a sense of the sheer age of Britain and its history. The ending is kind and gentle and you're left with a good feeling when you finish the book. If you don't like Lewis for his &quot;preachiness&quot; then stay far away if you don't like thinking, because he's using this more to illustrate a point more than anything else, but it's fine writing and a fine cap to an interesting series. And for those of you who started reading this series because it was science fictional, don't stop now, y'all could stand to read something different every once in a while. It won't hurt. Really."},{"Title":"That hideous strength,: A modern fairy-tale for grown-ups","review":"C. S. Lewis wraps up his &quot;Space Trilogy&quot; right back on planet Earth where it is up to a cadre of ordinary folks, mythical beings, and brute beasts to thwart the forces of supreme wickedness. With the assistance of the Director--a man familiar to readers of the previous two books in the trilogy--this strange collection of characters is pitted against a vaguely-familiar, propaganda-driven totalitarian regime ironically called by the acronym NICE.This book is Lewis at his satirical best--an uppercut landed to the jaw of secular, anti-family, &quot;post-christian&quot; society.What is particularly striking about this book is who Lewis fingers as the advance-guard for the evil that sadly dominates on Earth, ever trying to extend its power: a bunch of place-seeking, ethics-free, jive-talking academics who have long left any pretense to reason and science behind. Instead, they are driven by a misguided altruism that manifests itself, ultimately, as complete misanthropy.In this regard, Lewis must be regarded as prescient. Anyone who has spent any time in American academia will immediately sympathize with the plight of the characters in the book who *dare* to stand up to the censorial, elitist, marxist/leninist, anti-religion, pro-death agenda so prevalent among the &quot;progressive&quot; leadership of the university. Lewis had these people's number fifty years ago.In short, this book is a fun read and though couched in humorous terms, is deadly serious at its core."},{"Title":"That hideous strength,: A modern fairy-tale for grown-ups","review":"Lewis's writing these days is widely regarded as of exclusive interest to the God Squad and that is a pity. Certainly this is a work of pretty straightforward religious propaganda, a supernatural thriller written by someone who takes the supernatural stuff with the utmost seriousness but, hey, so is \\"The Exorcist\\" and that needn't disqualify it from entertaining the unconverted.This novel is the last and the only earthbound instalment of Lewis's Space trilogy. It's a theological; thriller in which the forces of darkness are seeking to destroy humanity through the agency of the sinister National Institute for Co-ordinated Experiments or NICE.The plot had two distinct threads. One involves Mark Studdock, a young don at the rather All-Souls-like Bracton College in the fictitious English town of Edgestow (which Lewis in a preface insists is not based on Durham). Mark is a weak man with a desperate desire for recognition and inclusion and is all to easily sucked into the unpleasant world of NICE. He fondly imagines they are headhunting him in recognition of his many talents but in fact they are mainly interested in him as a way to get at his wife, Jane, whose visionary dreams they perceive, rightly, as a threat. And Jane is the subject of the second plot line. While Mark is being sucked in to the world of the baddies at their headquarters at Belbury, a former blood transfusion centre, Jane is falling in with the goodies, a disparate band of desperately nice people at the manor at St Anne's, under the leadership of the charismatic Director, the Ransom of \\"Out of the Silent Planet\\" and \\"Perelandra\\".The St Anne's parts of the story are the less impressive. Ransom has been turned by his experiences on Mars and Venus into an outrageously charismatic, ageless and near-superhuman religious leader who is really a lot less interesting than the very human Ransom of the earlier stories and who spends most of his time delivering rather dull and condescending anti-feminist lectures to Jane. (We are constantly told she would ordinarily have found such lectures insufferable but he is just so charismatic, you see...) Recently fashionable stuff about the wisdom of being a \\"surrendered wife\\" really just recapitulates Ransom's line here though Lewis surely writes far better than more recent advocates of such doubtful ideas and perhaps succeeds making them as attractive and compelling as it is humanly possible to make them.The Belbury-Mark story is a lot more fun and comprises a splendid and acute essay in political satire. The picture it paints of a grimly rotten beaurocratic institution guided by what pass for \\"progressive\\" social ideals is one of the nicest things Lewis ever wrote. (Lewis's intellectual agenda here echoes in a fictional context thoughts he develops in \\"The Abolition of Man\\", one of his most interesting non-fiction essays.) Particularly well done is Belbury's \\"Deputy Director\\" Wither, whose talks a wonderful and hilarious form of verbal anti-matter that is all too recognisable as only a slight exaggeration of the worst sort of British public sector Managementspeak. The news management techniques espoused by the NICE are again satirically telling and in a strikingly contemporary way: New Labour, one fears, would have loved the NICE with their fascination with spin and \\"modernization\\".Perhaps the best and most insightful thing about the book is the characterization of Mark Studdock, an extremely telling, frighteningly plausible portrait of a man drawn into collaboration with evil not by wickedness but by weakness, a desperation to belong, to feel himself accepted in the world of those who wield the power and pull the strings. It's enormously unlikely that Hitler's Germany or Mao's China contained enough simply wicked people to sustain such poisonous regimes. But it is also enormously likely that they contained many many people who were foolish and weak in just the ways Mark Studdock was, people whose collaboporation makes them appropriate objects more for pity than for hatred.The climax is inevitably rather over the top, involving as it does the resurrection of the Arthurian druid Merlin whose ancient powers are crucial to determining the outcome of the conflict. Obviously things get a bit bonkers at this point but Lewis is rare among thriller writers for his scholarship and has the erudition in matters Arthurian to carry it off as well as anyone ever could. A real curiosity then, strange and sometimes a bit nuts but also very well-written, satirically telling, often psychologically and politically insightful and very readable."},{"Title":"That hideous strength,: A modern fairy-tale for grown-ups","review":"This is the third and final book in C.S. Lewis's amazing Space Trilogy. This book was written as a sequel to the immensely popular Out of the Silent Planet and Perelandra but Lewis also wrote it so that the story can stand on its own. So if you haven't read the first, you can start here.That Hideous Strength, unlike the first 2 books in this series, where Ransom leaves earth and fights evil in space and on other planets, the battle in this book takes place on earth.Ransom must lead a group of faithful believers against National Institute for Coordinated Experiments or N.I.C.E., an organization that believes that Science can solve all of humanity's problems. He must battle the people in this organization, super aliens trying to invade and control earth and use its population against other planets and against God.On top of all of that, Merlin has arisen from his long sleep and has arisen in England's time of greatest need. But the question is, who will find him first - N.I.C.E. or Ransom and his team? The fate of the world, and possibly the universe, rests on this question.Lewis called this story an adult's fairy-tale. It is a mix of sci-fi and fantasy, and a book that will keep your attention as you raptly turn the pages to find out where Lewis will lead you."},{"Title":"That hideous strength,: A modern fairy-tale for grown-ups","review":"Many fans of Lewis' work rate this least of the Space Trilogy books; it lacks \\"Out of the Silent Planet\\"'s wonder and \\"Perelandra\\"'s lyricism. However, for a look at where a situationally-moral, rationalist, humanist society is bound to wind up, it is priceless.The main characters are a young couple who got married out of love and are finding it hard going in \\"the real world\\". The wife, Jane, has an unusual ability to 'dream true' and when her dreams start applying to her own life, she finds it unsettling. Her husband, Mark, a young don (or professor) is no help; he's too wound up in college politics (and some very loathesome friends) and the possibility of a job with a new scientific foundation to pay much attention to her.The story really begins moving when the foundation, called Belbury, begins moving in on everyday life. But, as always with Lewis, there is a moral opposite ready to stand against Belbury; in it, we find an old friend and several new ones.This book is astonishingly accurate about where society is now -- as with some of Lewis' other observations (Screwtape's toast to the college comes to mind), it's hard to remember that Lewis wrote them nearly 50 years ago -- they're that close to current events and modern society."},{"Title":"That hideous strength,: A modern fairy-tale for grown-ups","review":"C.S. Lewis would not have named this series the Space Trilogy. He used the term Deep Heaven for \\"the packed reality that men call empty space.\\" Everyone else doesn't have a problem with the title so much as the fact that the boxed set of the three books is continually out of print.Of the three books, I think the second, Perelandra, alternately called Voyage to Venus, is the best. Yet the effect of reading the trilogy together and in order is better than that book alone. The first book, Out of the Silent Planet, is gripping so far as it goes. A friend of mine said the second book, Perelandra, was the best book she'd ever read. But I'd never considered the third book, That Hideous Strength on its own merits until I read an essay by philosophy prof Richard Purtill entitled \\"That Hideous Strength: A Double Tale.\\" Before that I viewed the last book as starting rather slow, even though it picks up half way through and pulls the three books through to a dazzling ending.The trilogy is written at a higher reading level than the Narnian Chronicles (the latter were meant for kids), although it's arguably easier to read than The Lord of the Rings. Note: Purtill's essay is scheduled to be included in the revised edition of Lord of the Elves and Eldils: Philosophy and Fantasy in Lewis and Tolkien due out sometime in 2006, along with his most popular essay, \\"Did C.S. Lewis Lose His Faith?\\" which argues against the view implied in the film Shadowlands that he did.The Narnian film may be introducing readers to the books, which, whatever one thinks of the film, is a good thing. But readers closing the Chronicles will be glad to find their way into Lewis' Deep Heaven and the rest of his fiction."},{"Title":"That hideous strength,: A modern fairy-tale for grown-ups","review":"In \\"That Hideous Strength\\", C.S. Lewis brings his SciFi trilogy back to Earth and takes it in a different direction. The first book, \\"Out of the Silent Planet\\", and the second, \\"Perelandra\\" use space travel and encounters with inhabitants of Mars and Venus respectively as vehicles for Lewis' spiritual allegory. \\"That Hideous Strength\\" leaves space travel behind and feels more like a horror story in which the forces of evil conspire against goodness on Earth. Of the three books, this one is the least fun, but it is the one with the most memorable depiction of the means by which the dark side manipulates human perceptions to destroy impulses toward goodness, hope, and love.I first read this book in the 1970's. Frequently over the years since, while looking at paintings in museums, Lewis' words in \\"That Hideous Strength\\" have come back to me as an alternate angle for assessment of the art in front of me."},{"Title":"That hideous strength,: A modern fairy-tale for grown-ups","review":"I have read this book several times and each time I pick it up find it hard to put it down. C.S. Lewis' satirical insights and observations of human nature are not only the stuff of genius but just as relevant now as they were sixty years ago.The story is engaging from the very beginning, even though it starts \\"innocently\\" enough with the course of a young married couple who put their own selfish ambitions ahead of each other. They are drawn into spiritual worlds quite opposite from one another and the story just continues to build in scale and tension as it heads for its climax. C.S. Lewis was a marvel in particular of his understanding of how evil minds operate (see \\"The Screwtape Letters\\"), their political machinations, and how they can suck others into a web of self-destruction by appealing first and foremost to the ego.I am not surprised to read some of the reasons for some of the negative reviews posted here as they reflect common disappointments with this, the third book in the so-called \\"Space Trilogy.\\" For one, this third book is different in tone and setting and use of characters than the previous two, perhaps undermining expectations for readers of the first two novels. Don't let that affect your judgment of the book because it is a brilliant conclusion to the series, and one of the reasons I think so is because of the differences I mentioned. A recurring theme in C.S. Lewis' writings is how people put God in a box with preconceived notions of religiosity and that theme is constantly visited in \\"That Hideous Strength\\". So it is only appropriate if this book does not fit in with readers' preconceived notions of plot and setting!Further, if one does not approve of Lewis' depiction of the roles of husband and wife, then one must also take issue with the Bible itself, for it is from that source that Lewis draws his point of view on the subject.Wonderful, entertaining and wise, \\"That Hideous Strength\\" is full of the kind of clever insights and different ways of looking at things that make C.S. Lewis' writings so endearing. It is my favorite book in the series."},{"Title":"That hideous strength,: A modern fairy-tale for grown-ups","review":"Hidden in this excellent science-fiction novel is a startling look at our own society.

Enjoy!"},{"Title":"That hideous strength,: A modern fairy-tale for grown-ups","review":"\\"That Hideous Strength\\" is the 3rd and final book in C.S. Lewis' space trilogy. Although \\"That Hideous Strength\\" takes place entirely on Earth, supernatural elements from the first two books make an appearance in this one.Anytime a book (such as this one) makes me underline passages on nearly every page and anytime a book makes me stop to think about ideas or care about the characters or re-read passages for the sheer delight they bring, I know I've just read a classic.While difficult and dense at times, \\"That Hideous Strength\\" is a classic that should provoke an enlightening joy in its readers!Lewis called his book \\"A fairy tale for grown ups,\\" which is actually a pretty good summary of the whole thing. What Lewis attempts (and mostly achieves) is to represent the invisible spiritual realities through the ordinary, humdrum things of the world. As in fairy tales, \\"That Hideous Strength\\" starts out with the ordinary but ends up in the most extraordinary way.I won't ruin the plot for those who haven't read it, but Lewis primarily deals with the life of a married couple, Mark and Jane Studdock. It's important that the novel begins with marriage, refers to marriage throughout, and ends with marriage. While marriage, especially one like the Studdock's, may seem humdrum, it is, in reality, a profound spiritual picture of both the union between Christ and the Church and of the union of love that is to exist among men.When I recently taught \\"That Hideous Strength\\" to a high school class in Apologetics at the classical Anglican school where I teach, I had them read the book through the lens of \\"influence,\\" \\"peer pressure,\\" and \\"motivations.\\" As you read the book, pay attention to why Mark and Jane acts the way they do, who influences them, and what their motivations are. Lewis has given us a profound imaginative look at how our lives are really governed. This book ended up being the perfect companion to my Apologetics class in which I tried to get my students to see the necessity of every Christian giving an account of the hope that is within them. We've also spent a lot of time this year talking about peer pressure and how it can lead Christians closer to or further away from God.Another way of reading \\"That Hideous Strength\\" is to look at it through the lens of the different worldviews that are presented. Among these are the unthinking atheism of Mark, the selfish practical atheism and individualism of Jane, the modernistic dream of human reason, a more postmodern mix of reason and the occult, and Christianity. It's fascinating to see the war of the worldviews at work in \\"That Hideous Strength\\"! Lewis clearly understood the spiritual state of England in 1946, and his analysis of that condition continues to have relevance for the Western world in the 21st century. Lewis' fairy tale succeeds in alerting his readers to the very real presence of the supernatural in our ordinary lives.One of the things that make the book such a joy to read is Lewis' insight into human nature. While the \\"I\\" passages of the book are unnecessarily obtrusive, Lewis nevertheless gives the reader a lot of keen insight into the nature of man, the nature of marriage, and the psychology that lies behind our thoughts and actions.Another sumptuous part of the novel is Lewis' language. As with so many of his other works, he has many quotable lines from either the characters or the narrators. At other times, a lyrical beauty sings through the passages, such as those where he describes the effects that earthly characters feel when in the presence of the eldil or angels.Even the plot itself, filled with most fantastic twists and turns and bizarre occurrences, will not only delight but also shock the reader into wanting to read until the consummation of events in the final chapter.Finally, I find Lewis' injection of not only Merlin but also Arthurian mythology to be not only out of place but also a positive distraction from the Christian meaning and symbolism of the rest of the novel. It's almost as if Lewis, being the classical and medieval scholar he was, couldn't help himself. It makes for fascinating reading, but it's not entirely favorable in its effect.In spite of a few odd things I didn't care for, \\"That Hideous Strength\\" remains a wonder and delight that I highly recommend to serious readers, especially those who are Christian."},{"Title":"That hideous strength,: A modern fairy-tale for grown-ups","review":"C. S. Lewis - THAT HIDEOUS STRENGTHTHS is the third installment in his Space Trilogy. For those who have read the previous two novels (though this is self-contained enough to read as a stand-alone work), they will find themselves introduced to a whole new series of characters, some devilish, some not.The first time I've heard of the trilogy, it was from a pastor's wife. I was only then reading THE LORD OF THE RINGS (this was back in 1994), and I decided I would try it. Being a fan of Narnia (although I do not like Lion nearly as much as the others), I figured this would be good also.THAT HIDEOUS STRENGHT, which is longer than the other two books combined, is a book like no other I've read. Everytime I read it I get something new, and, even though I don't much care for the Arthurian element in the story, this is probably my favorite of all of Lewis's fiction, even though he has better (TILL WE HAVE FACES). The novel is reach in characters and ideas (sometimes too much), and I've never read anything else that gives me the same feeling or experience that I get when I read this novel. This is among my top three that I most often return too of Lewis's fiction. Anyway, on to the review.Lewis, in finishing up this Space Trilogy, presents us with the most complex novel in the series. Lewis reaches for and touches on so many different themes and social concerns throughout the course of the novel, it is impressive on the range of his thought. This book can be the most difficult of the three (although its still highly readable), because so much is going on, and it has been harshly criticized for the amount of material Lewis tried (unsuccessfully, some would argue) to cover in voicing his own social concerns.Another interesting element of the novel is its relationship to Middle-earth. Lewis makes it quite clear in the novel when he brings in element's of Tolkien's mythology that he is setting his universe in the same imagined space that Tolkien's occurs in. Lewis specifically mentions Middle-earth several times in the novel, and brings in Numenor (a misspelling of Numenor). A careful reading shows THS may be the very first case of fanfiction ever for Tolkien, a full eight years before LOTR was published (though Lewis knew the at that time unfinished work quite well when he was writing THS).Before we get started you should now more about the novel's genre, as the Space Trilogy is commonly classified as SF. As far as science fiction goes, there are some elements of SF present in THS, but Lewis calls it a fairy tale for a reason - this isn't really science fiction, not the kind you'd find Asimov or Heinline or Clarke. This more mythic than anything, much like PERELANDRA (read my review for my thoughts on that novel), and not really SF-based at all.The novel is about the corruption of men and women, and how two sides, one good, one evil, are trying to capture Britain. The novel focuses primarily on two journeys taken by a husband and wife.The main characters are Mark and Jane Studdock, a modern couple who are lost to God and to each other. Jane begins having dreams that are visions of events that are really happening, and ultimately goes to meet with Elwin Ransom about the issue. Meanwhile Mark, a fellow at a college, gets a new employment opportunity with the N. I. C. E. (National Institute for Coordinator Experiments), and so starts his journey into their hellish world. The NICE is ultimately a satanic organization, and appears very much an Orwellian creation. They are trying to take over the government, have their own police force, and control the presses. The N. I. C. E. would be something Orwell would write if he were Christian. Ultimately we find out they are trying have taken the head of a dead criminal, imbibed it with life, and have given themselves over to satanic forces. The Head is demonically possessed. It is through this demonic possession that Satan gives orders to the heads of the NICE. This strength that the NICE as is what the title refers to. The title is drawn from a medival poem about Babel, which also fits in quite nicely as at the novel's climax God confuses men's speech.The opposing forces, lead by Ransom, is the perfect counter picture to the NICE. There is a love for all things that grow and give life. They are a small group of people waiting for directions from Ransom's superiors (God and angels) to begin combat with the NICE. There are several charming and endearing characters on Ransom's side, including Dr. Dimble (a old don who is married but has no children), and MacPhee, a non-Christian whose function is to be the Skeptic.The main action of the novel follows Jane and Mark moving about in their new circles. Ultimately we find out both have been trying to get to Jane, which is why the NICE wants Mark in the first place. She is a dreamer, and so she may be able to find Merlin, who has been swept out of time for the last fifteen hundred years. Both sides assume Merlin will be on their side. When Ransom's group finally finds Merlin first, turns out Merlin is Christian.Once Merlin arrives, the waiting that Ransom's group has been doing for most of the novel is at long last completed. The time for action has come. Ultimately Merlin himself descends upon the NICE, and in one of the most bloody and gruesome scenes in modern literature Merlin eradicates NICE. Animals that were being experimented on by the Institute also escape and join in the carnage.At the end of the novel, Mark and Jane are reunited, and the gods descend upon St. Anne's (the house Ransom's group are at) and carry Ransom away. The ending is very much a celebration of sacred Christian sexuality, and the novel closes as Mark and Jane are together in a bridal chamber they have been preparing. Lewis's intention for the two characters is they obviously make love, and in all likelihood get pregnant that night.The third book, THAT HIDEOUS STRENGTH, is longer that the first two combined. In Sayer's biography (I think it's Sayer - if not its in the Green-Hooper biography) a statement is made that THAT HIDEOUS STRENGTH is a Charles Williams novel written by C. S. Lewis, and having reading some Williams I now see why they say that. Tolkien felt William's influence spoiled it, with too much Arthurian mythology incorporated into it. I'm personally not a big fan of King Arthur stories, but this does give me a broader appreciation for them. Many readers may wonder why both sides have such an intense desire to obtain Merlin. Lewis assumes too much knowledge of the reader here. According to legend Merlin is an incubus, a child without a father.THS may very well be the best of the trilogy, but there are several weaknesses in it.1. For one, much of the novel is spent in realistic settings. Though we are naturally horrified by the NICE, we don't want them so brutally killed as they are at the end of this book. Its main weakness is it jumps from modern to mythical too soon. It is a novel of ideas, and then at the climax the story becomes mythical, with a violent ending.2. Another topic that concerns critics is Lewis's use of violence in THS. Lewis was invoking Dante throughout, but the real problem, as Downing says in PLANETS IN PERIL, that the transition between the modern satirical novel and that of mythology occurs too quickly here. Another fault THS has is the flat villains who can only be bad, and on the good side some of the characters have the same fault.3. Lewis assumes to much of the readers on the matter of Merlin. Unless your familiar with Merlin, you will not know why both sides are so keen to obtain him. Merlin was an incubus, and had no father. That being the case, both sides thing Merlin is something similar to an eldil, or angel, and for both sides he would be a powerful addition to their forces. Ransom is also concerned if the other side captures him they will never find Merlin, and if Merlin is not Christian, Merlin doesn't know how to contend with him, but knows he must4. In the OSP and PERELANDRA, Ransom is an engaging, though flawed, human, a person the average reader can really relate too. In THS though, he is much more distant. He's never as accessibly human in THS as he was in the other installments. Ransom never seems fully realised as a character as he did in the previous two novels. Ransom becomes much more idealised, whereas in the two previous books Ransom was just like the average sincere Christian man, with struggles and faults. Now, he is the leader and seems to be beyond reproach.After citing these faults, please do not come to the conclusion I do not like THS; far from that actually. This is my personal favorite of the three, despite the perceived faults.This is highly recommended. It's notable this is one of Lewis's best selling works - despite the previously cited criticisms, this is Lewis at the top of his game. And what a game it is!"},{"Title":"That hideous strength,: A modern fairy-tale for grown-ups","review":"When I first read That Hideous Strength, I was too young to understand many of the themes presented, and in trying to enjoy it as simply a story, I finished it feeling confused. When I returned to it a couple years later, I found it incredibly in-depth and rich with wonderful themes, tying in earlier references from Out of the Silent Planet and Perelandra as it built up to one grand conclusion.This is NOT a light read, but if you have the patience to read slowly and savor each nuance, it is well worth it. It requires the same reading style that true fans of Tolkien's LOTR trilogy develop in order to absorb the masterful work properly.I would not recommend this book to anyone younger than late teenage years or older, as many youth are not prepared to deal with the themes (that Lewis presents) in a matter-of-fact way, and are more likely to react strongly to dated attitudes towards women (sadly, many readers do remain that way even as they chronologically age). More mature readers are able to look past those as typical of the times in which Lewis lived, and learn from his full story, which is an excellent lesson for us all."},{"Title":"That hideous strength,: A modern fairy-tale for grown-ups","review":"This is my 2nd favorite fiction ever, right after Atlas Shrugged by Ayn Rand. &quot;Hideous&quot; is brilliant because it combines a pragmatic look at evil people and diabolical conspiracies with a wit and humor that keeps me laughing on almost every page.And in classic Lewis style, interwoven everywhere are religious allegories and symbolism. This book is a treat, like a creamsicle on a summer afternoon.I was confused at the beginning since the story seems to suddenly break from the 1st two in the trilogy, both in storyline, and in the fact that there seems to be no science fiction in Hideous. But everything becomes clear later on, and the trilogy is truly continued.This may become known as the most undiscovered book of the 20th century, but it's a classic and a literary jewel."},{"Title":"That hideous strength,: A modern fairy-tale for grown-ups","review":"This was a wonderful classic that I discovered! It can be read by adults and older kids (teens). C.S. Lewis is a master!"},{"Title":"That hideous strength,: A modern fairy-tale for grown-ups","review":"Lewis brings his space trilogy back to the planet Earth for this final installment. Since Ransom is back on earth, the tone of the book loses the \\"fantastic\\" nature of the previous two novels. However, Lewis's main theme is still the same: good in its battle against evil. Here evil initially takes more recognizable forms before growing into more extreme forms (I don't want to give anything away). He warns against many forms of evil that were then just beginning to appear but have now reached fruition. Though Lewis obviously has a passionate agenda (what great writer doesn't?), he doesn't lose the narrative. It is again an original novel and a horrifying vision of what evil is capable of and how good must find the courage to oppose evil."},{"Title":"That hideous strength,: A modern fairy-tale for grown-ups","review":"I raved about the first 2 books of this trilogy. I can't about the last.Lewis makes a very significant change in his voice and approach here in the final book of his \\"Space Trilogy.\\" Knowing some of the history of its writing, this is in large part due to his closer association with and the influence of the fellow author and member of \\"The Inklings,\\" George MacDonald.MacDonald's influence upon Lewis is evidenced by this book being much darker and much less connected to the theme of the first 2 books. It's almost like watching Lewis trying to do a literary exercise.Still excellent writing and worth the read, but when I read the work I found the feeling to be much more heavy and dark. Even the change in character focus contributes toward the feeling of discontinuity.That having been said, Lewis very much hits the mark with the ethical and philosophical conundrums that have multiplied and confounded our modern era. It is almost prophetic how the biological ethical issues of today are foreseen and portrayed in a book written in 1945.Yes some of it can be explained by the context of the times in which it was written (WWII) and the darker influence of the melancholic MacDonald, but some of it comes from the nature of the material and logical progression as Lewis begins to deal not with fantasy worlds, but our own world and all of its far too evident foibles.Ironic too is the focus upon the National Institute for Coordinated Experiments (NICE). Echoes of Orwell abound.Do not come to this work expecting more of Ransom and company. This work feels disconnected from the others. \\"Bent,\\" if you will. Once you get over that and begin to read and digest the very meaningful portrayals of our future world through Lewis' eyes, you will have a fresh appreciation of his unique voice and writing skills.A very satisfying and worthwhile read. Not quite a rave review, but certainly an endorsement."},{"Title":"That hideous strength,: A modern fairy-tale for grown-ups","review":"Love this trilogy. Read it first many years ago, and loving going through it again. A must have for any lover of good scifi and spiritual traveller"},{"Title":"That hideous strength,: A modern fairy-tale for grown-ups","review":"I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.-Exodus 33:19Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom: and with all thy getting get understanding.&#8232;-Proverbs 4:7&#8232;I've read nearly all of C.S. Lewis's works (both fiction and non-fiction) and enjoyed all of them, but there are some works that remain with me more than others. His Space Trilogy (AKA, the Cosmic Trilogy or Ransom Trilogy) are the first novels of his that I read and remain my favorite among his works of fiction. I recognize that these are not his most popular works though (The Chronicles of Narnia holds that position). For many years I have wondered why? I think it comes down which of two attributes common to fantasy stories, mercy or wisdom, modern readers desire and which is emphasized more in each story.In the three most popular fantasy works of our time, The Lord of the Rings, The Chronicles of Narnia and the Harry Potter series, either the underlying theme or the tipping point of the story was an act or attitude of mercy, (i.e. Frodo to Gollum, Aslan to Edmond and Eustace, Harry towards Peter Pettigrew and Dumbledore towards nearly everyone).However, in the books of Lewis's Space Trilogy the focus is on wisdom. As do most wisdom stories, these teach by example; either positive \\"this is what you should do\\" (as Professor Ransom, who starts out a good man in the first book of the trilogy, Out of The Silent Planet, and gets better as the books progress), or negative \\"this is what you should not do\\" (i.e. Mark Studdock's immature need to be part of the inner circle in the third book, That Hideous Strength). While these works are admired and have sold well, they are not in the same mega-bestseller class as are the \\"mercy\\" stories. Why is that? Were the sales of the Space Trilogy far below the Narnia stories simply because Narnia was aimed at children, who are believed to be a larger group of fantasy readers than adults? What about more recent books, like those of British writers J. K. Rowling or Susanna Clarke? Is it the writing? I think most critics would agree that, line for line; Clarke is a more sophisticated writer than Rowling, but it is Rowling who has become the richest woman in England through her writing.&#8232;I can understand why mercy is more popular than wisdom in our day. Wisdom may teach you how to fish, but when you are starving you don't want a fishing pole, you want food and you want it right now. Wisdom may keep you out of trouble, but mercy can get you out of the trouble you are already in. Wisdom is something that you must earn, it takes work. Mercy is something unearned; it is a gift freely given at no cost to you (though it may cost the giver dearly). It is not the innocent that need mercy; it is the guilty. Have you noticed that most children have no problem with the harsh punishments imposed upon the villains of fairy tales? It is we adults who find the justice severe in these tales and would like to see it tempered with mercy. Perhaps there are more adults in our society who feel that they need mercy than there are those who desire wisdom.&#8232;It may also be that mercy is more in keeping with what makes fantasy a different genre than other types of fiction. Frodo did not show mercy towards Gollum because he hoped that Gollum would ultimately save him from the evil power of the ring. Frodo's mercy was a gift; and, importantly, a gift from higher to lower. That this gift ended up saving the day was something of a miracle and miracles are what fantasy is all about.&#8232;Wisdom on the other hand is different. Wisdom is something you can learn; it is a skill, a technique, almost a technology. You expect it to work. Mercy is the gift of the underdog, the little guy, the weak. Wisdom is the tool of the favorite, the experienced, the one expected to win. Most heroes of fantasy stories these days start out as the underdog. But this was not always the case. Once upon a time princes and heroes were the main characters in fantasies and myths. Go back a few hundred years and it would have been Aragorn who destroyed the ring and Harry Potter would have been born a prince.&#8232;Historically, most fables and fairy tales were wisdom stories. \\"If you are foolish, bad things will happen to you\\" or \\"while the hero did something foolish to get himself into trouble, he was able to use the things he learned along his journey to get himself out.\\" Most of these stories are examples of problem solving and pluck. I find it interesting that, back in the days when most people believed in miracles, most fantasy tales emphasized wisdom. In our day, when most people don't believe in miracles, the most popular of fantasy stories emphasize mercy.Lewis's Space Trilogy harkens back to that earlier mode of storytelling. While they do contain elements of mercy, the gaining of wisdom is the main way the good characters grow in these tales. If your temperament leans more towards the gaining of wisdom rather than the showing of mercy, then Lewis's Space Trilogy are the books for you.NOBILIS VOS ESTOS,&#8232;William R.

Enjoyed the unexpected 'solution' and the treatment of certain 'historical' characters. I recommend the entire trilogy, but only for a thinking reader."},{"Title":"That hideous strength,: A modern fairy-tale for grown-ups","review":"Originally posted at FanLit. Come visit us!\\"Nature is the ladder we have climbed up by. Now we kick her away.\\"That Hideous Strength is the final volume of C.S. Lewis's SPACE TRILOGY. This story, which could be categorized as science fiction, dystopian fiction, Arthurian legend, and Christian allegory, is different enough from the previous books, Out of the Silent Planet and Perelandra, that you don't need to have read them, but it may help to vaguely familiarize yourself with their plots. Generally, in the previous stories, Dr. Elwin Ransom has been to both Mars and Venus and discovered that the planets are governed by heavenly beings and that Earth's governor is a fallen angel. These forces are at war and the fate of the universe is at stake.In That Hideous Strength, Ransom is back on Earth and is preparing a group of people who can fight the forces of evil. This evil is manifesting as a corporation called the National Institute of Coordinated Experimentation (N.I.C.E.) which is trying to purchase some wooded property owned by Bracton College at the University of Edgestow in England. To do this, they've had to exert their influence over some of the \\"progressive\\" faculty by getting them to buy into their subtle message of saving the human race through (but not obviously yet) sterilization, selective breeding, re-education, and biochemical conditioning. The end-goal, though they only talk about this in the inner circle, is a future in which the working class is no longer needed to support the brains that run the world. NICE wants the talents of the progressive faculty on their side as they generate propaganda, but they also want to recruit some more ancient magic -- they plan to dig up the body of Merlin, which they believe may be buried on the college's property.Dr. Mark Studdock, a sociologist and a new Bracton faculty member who doesn't feel like he quite fits in yet, is tempted to join NICE when they offer him a high-status job. At first Mark is suspicious of the group and their recruitment methods and he's bothered by the vague job description, but their insistence that they need him, their appeal to his vanity, and his low self esteem combine to make their offer seem attractive. Having left Bracton to join the NICE administration, Mark is unaware of the police tactics that NICE is using to make the college town comply with their new order. Meanwhile, also back at Bracton, Mark's new wife, Jane, is having ominous visions. Thinking she may be going crazy, she seeks help and ends up among the group, lead by Dr. Ransom, which is fighting NICE.One thing that C.S. Lewis does so well in this novel is to portray the slippery slope of Mark's gradual slide into evil which is caused by a lack of his own moral compass. Though he doesn't realize it at first, he is foremost a people-pleaser. He wants to increase his status in the eyes of both his colleagues and his wife, and though he's not actually concerned about his character for himself, he wants others to admire him. Wanting to seem both successful (financially and professionally) and of good character, and without any moral grounding of his own, he has no idea how to behave in this situation and eventually succumbs to the pressure. When he becomes better acquainted with NICE's tactics and plans, the cognitive dissonance he feels leads him to wholly embrace the evil. It doesn't help that Mark discovers that even when he tries to be good, there is no natural law that the universe must reward him for it.In contrast, characters who have a stronger sense of self, like Jane, have more concrete ideas about right and wrong and are not as easily influenced or corrupted. Yet Lewis doesn't condemn Mark while wholly commending Jane. Instead, Mark's inferiority complex seems heartbreaking, and Lewis makes Jane, an educated feminist, deal with her hatred of masculinity. Other good characters are forced to examine their own self-righteousness.Another thing that is beautifully done in That Hideous Strength is Lewis' melding of the ancient and new, especially in England's history -- the dark ages with its ancient forest magic, mythical creatures, and irrational superstition, and the new age of rationalism, science and technology. Lewis also speaks eloquently about the difference between organized religion and real spiritual experience. There are also some lovely literary allusions in That Hideous Strength; no fantasy literature lover is likely to miss Lewis' reference to the work of his friend J.R.R. Tolkien.That Hideous Strength is a deeply philosophical novel which, except for the mention of corsets, doesn't feel dated though it was published in 1945. Some readers may not appreciate all the philosophizing, but I am always fascinated by C.S. Lewis' ideas, finding them logical, enlightening, and superbly said. Some of these ideas can be found in his non-fiction works The Abolition of Man, Mere Christianity, God in the Dock, and probably others that I haven't read. That Hideous Strength -- in fact the entire SPACE TRILOGY -- is a profoundly thoughtful and beautiful work of science fiction. I recommend Blackstone Audio's version narrated by Geoffrey Howard."},{"Title":"That hideous strength,: A modern fairy-tale for grown-ups","review":"Lewis's writing seems always to be about the struggleof good and evil. His \\"evil\\", as I see it, consistsof a separation from the joy of love and life, and adescent into passionless, dull destruction andtime-wasting. While I am not a Christian, I deeplyappreciate his insights on how we get caught in habitsof this kind of evil, and drawn away from joy.Lewis's portrayal in this book of the advancement of evil through individuals' petty efforts at self-aggrandizement rang true. It was frightening to watch unfold through nearly content-free board meetings and hall conversations.There were also some choice insights in the course of the book about how we can help or hinder ourselves in being good. Lewis tends to be clear about the point that devotion to God (or goodness) has nothing to do with looking saintly every Sunday in the right sort of church, and everything to do with cultivating generous impulses, enjoying the life given to us, and being good to one another, without regard for personal status.I enjoyed the first part of the story quite a bit, as both literature and spiritual exploration. When Lewis suddenly introduced Martians (I am wildly oversimplifying for the sake of clarity) the effect was ludicrously awkward, IMHO, but I was willing to let it go, particularly since he had in fact spent two previous books, only one of which I've read, presenting these entities in more context.The ending, unfortunately, shared this awkwardness. After a book-long buildup, it seemed to all fly to pieces in a rather unsatisfying manner that felt less like a resolution than like Cecil B. DeMille pulling out all the stops and using all his ancient Roman and Biblical costumes, props, sets, and wild animals at once.Some great bits, good spiritual insights, thought-provoking, but flawed as a novel. I recommend it if you can forgive that and want some thoughts about goodness and evil to chew on."},{"Title":"That hideous strength,: A modern fairy-tale for grown-ups","review":"This final book in Lewis' space trilogy is very different from its predecessors. It starts a lot more slowly, but builds to a higher crescendo. The characters are more nuanced, less like cardboard cutouts labeled \\"good\\" and \\"evil.\\" Finally, more than the others, the ending is clear, timely, and very satisfying.It's hard to describe this book, but try to picture Orwell's 1984 rewritten from a Christian view. The world had not reached Orwell's nightmare, but was headed decisively in that direction. The leaders of that putsch had all too familiar an appearance, and were ready to make every use of people uncertain of their own morality.The end of the book, just a few pages following the end of the conflict, took me quite by surprise. (No, I won't give it away.) In retrospect, though, it makes a lot of sense. Lewis was acutely aware of mankind's combined nature, physical and spiritual, with no need for distinction to be made. In \\"The Screwtape Letters\\", Lewis stated the importance of physically kneeling to pray because of how the physical act of kneeling affects the mind made from that physical body. I am quite sure that the ending was written to be as devout as Lewis could possibly make it, and it is a very beautiful vision of sacred duty.This book is immensely more mature a work than the two that preceded it. The others create context for this one, but this stands very well by itself. If you have patience with its slow start, you may be happily surpised.//wiredweird"},{"Title":"That hideous strength,: A modern fairy-tale for grown-ups","review":"The final volume of Lewis's Space Trilogy is a major departure from the first two volumes, which really serve as a prologue for this novel, wherein the forces of God and Satan (or their allegorical equivalents) face off in final battle.Dr. Ransom, the hero of the first two books is a secondary - although quite significant character - in this book, and he doesn't even appear till over a hundred pages have passed. Instead, the story focuses on Jane and Mark, a newly married couple with difficulties already developing in their relationship.Although they are a couple, they are apart for most of the book, each involved in their own adventures. Mark is lured into the service of the sinister organization NICE, where he is convinced to do small services that seem legitimate enough but are designed to further their agenda. Meanwhile, Jane, plagued by clairvoyant visions, winds up joining with Dr. Ransom's group, which is out to save the world from NICE.Jane and Mark, physically separated and emotionally estranged, find themselves also on opposite sides in a cosmic conflict between good and evil. Although this is a high-stakes battle, it is not overly supernatural, as the forces of good and evil operate with human agents/pawns. And Lewis is not as interested in the adventure aspects of his story as using it as a vehicle for presenting certain theological (especially Christian) concepts in an entertaining manner.The end result is a story that is a bit dry in spots but generally good. This story is more sophisticated than the Narnia books, which are aimed towards a younger audience, but this trilogy is also not as much fun as the Chronicles of Narnia. If you read this trilogy expecting Narnia, you may be disappointed, as you will if you are expecting what is normally considered science fiction. On the other hand, if you want to read a thought-provoking fictional work, this may be to your liking."},{"Title":"That hideous strength,: A modern fairy-tale for grown-ups","review":"The final book in Lewis's Space Trilogy finds Dr. Ransom confronting a huge international organization bent on the submission of the human race and given to all kinds of strange scientific experiments and with one supreme goal--to eliminate all free thinking and emotion. This organization, the N.I.C.E., uses the press, government reform programs, and all kinds of propaganda to make them seem like the new heroes in England, while slowly they subdue the government and begin a takeover of the world. It's Ransom's job to stop them, though this time he has some followers and aid from a recently awakened power that has long slept.True to his style, Lewis makes this a very entertaining novel with a great underlying message. It is very well-written and teeming with symbolism that ultimately denounces the love of science over the love of God.This book is a great read--highly recommended."},{"Title":"That hideous strength,: A modern fairy-tale for grown-ups","review":"As a fairy tale, this book starts off rather slowly (as many fairy tales do), but the action eventually picks up and the ending is good.

Lewis manages bring in several other mythologies into his own story, including Numinor (from his friend J.R.R. Tolkien's LORD OF THE RINGS) and Merlin (from the Arthurian saga).

She is advised by friends to consult with a woman regarding the dreams, and she enters into a circle of people who are headed up by Dr. Ransom.Ironically, Dr. Ransom's circle is fighting the evil deeds of another exclusive group that Mark has found himself coerced into.

I really enjoyed That Hideous Strength, but it's almost impossible to explain how well it was written. It will sound a bit farfetched from my descriptions, but somehow it keeps all its varying aspects perfectly blended into the story.Overall it is an engaging fantasy mingling with sci-fi. It tells the story of a young couple who are caught between good and evil. On the side of good is the old-fashioned England, the spirits of the deep heavens, and characters like Mr. Bultitude and Ivy Maggs that charm and delight. McPhee is hilarious while Ramson himself is wise and yet human. On the side of evil there is the movement towards 'social progress' with characters like Frost and Withers that fascinate with their perverse logic. Lord Feverstone is a familiar smiling bastard while The Fairy is repulsive and pitiful.Caught between these are Jane and Mark, the pragmatic newly married couple whose failure in love provides interesting fodder in and of itself. It covers the moral aspects of forward progress really well, the old-fashioned English village with all its quirks is pitted against the facist social purity of labratory and government merged. Then add an appearance by Merlyn and old magic, giving it an interesting Arthurian slant I've never seen done before.I admit that a few of the essay-style conversations about morality were wordy, but I loved this book. The descriptions are beautiful and enticing, and even briefly appearing characters are meaningful. It is at once engaging and fascinating and fun at different levels.

That said, it was probably my least favorite of the three novels.That Hideous Strength, which takes its name from a 16th century poem about the Tower of Babel (this comes into play in the story's final moments), can be evaluated in two ways: its influence, and the story itself.There is no doubt that this has been an influential book. Along with The Abolition of Man, a non-fiction book written by Lewis in 1943 (two years prior to That Hideous Strength), this book addresses a reductionist, science-based understanding of humanity and the decreasing acceptance of an objective moral standard. Lewis felt very strongly about the issues he'd presented in the essays compiled in Abolition, but felt that literature was a more effective way of disseminating his own views.The antagonists in the story are a secret society with influence throughout British society, from politics to education to media to religion. They even have their own private army/police force. This group (called the National Institute of Co-ordinated Experiments, or \\"N.I.C.E.\\") believes that mankind must take charge of its own evolution, and that through scientific means, can determine what it means to actually be human. Through subversive means (primarily through control of the media) the N.I.C.E. aims to bend England, and eventually the rest of the planet, to its own worldview.This presents a dystopian view of the future, which has been seen by many readers as a distinct possibility in reality. There are people and organizations with those motives (though perhaps not the exact method of seeing them through). They have largely gained control of the media and educational institutions. The result has been a loss of \\"faith\\" in objective moral standards in society-at-large. For these reasons, That Hideous Strength has been seen as somewhat \\"prophetic\\", much in the same way as other novels written by some of Lewis' contemporaries, such as Orwell's 1984 and Rand's Atlas Shrugged.While I agree with the Christian worldview which tinted Lewis' novels far more than I agree with the worldviews of atheists such as Orwell and Rand, I thought that the supernatural elements of That Hideous Strength actually detracted from the story. The story is obviously a fantasy (the book is subtitled \\"A Modern Fairy-Tale for Grownups\\"), but Lewis' depiction of angelic beings and mythical creatures seemed an awkward addition to an otherwise very realistic depiction of a (then) near-future England.I certainly believe that spiritual warfare plays a more significant role in day-to-day events than most people realize, but I found the combination of mystery/intrigue with medieval and mythological characters a bit confusing at times. Personally, I think that Lewis could have communicated his point better had he chosen to focus more on either the fantastic or the realistic elements, rather than juxtaposing them to the extent that he did. In this regard, I am in agreement with George Orwell himself, who reviewed That Hideous Strength in 1945. You can find that review online.However, I also agree with Orwell that, on the whole, this is a tremendous book, and worthy of recommendation."},{"Title":"That hideous strength,: A modern fairy-tale for grown-ups","review":"This is the end of the trilogy, for the first time entirely on earth. It is a fun story of earthy corruption, with lots of Christian details, and some surprise figures like Merlin. But ultimately, it is a good story that does not do much really new. So if you are a fan of Lewis, which I am, it is a pleasure to reach the end. What really distinguishes this is the elegant writing. Lewis was a master of prose and theme. But I did enjoy the first two much much more as path-breaking if amateur scifi.Recommended for fans. They will not be disappointed.

Anyway, this was not my style of book."},{"Title":"That hideous strength,: A modern fairy-tale for grown-ups","review":"Lewis, like his friend and fellow philologist Tolkien, dealt in the creation of realistic myth. This well paced novel culminates his Space Trilogy, commencing with Out of the Silent Planet and continuing with Perelandra, based on the theme of natural and beneficial order versus the illusion of unchecked, destructive \\"human progress.\\"While one may take objection to many of Lewis's ideas on religion - I myself do - the unseen world of the eldils, or angels - both good and bad - that he constructs is so grandiose and fascinating that I for one forgive him all offences.The story opens quietly in a small English town, where a modern young woman - modern for 1945 that is - endures the frustrations of marriage to an underpaid fellow of a minor university. From this innocent beginning, the pair become entrapped by the machinery of a satanic group bent on world domination.Step by step they are enticed into a satanic plan for world domination, yet, while the plot snares them with all the devilish menace that a reader could wish for, its grasp on their lives is achieved by everyday, believable manipulations: the threatened loss of employment, the flattery of recognition, the temptation of money, power and fame. Eventually the Satanists overreach themselves, and the novel culminates in an imaginative battle of good and evil, with both spiritual and brute physical forces on either side.The writer George Orwell argues that the inevitable triumph of good over evil weakens the novel, but I don't agree. To me, its charm lies not in its ending but in the skill with which the story is told. It says much for this story, that though science has overtaken it during passage of half a century and more, its lives as though written today.I particularly enjoy Lewis's construction of opposed hierarchies, and the subtlety with which both good and bad characters are drawn. But how remarkable it is that we are often drawn more to the bad characters! My favourite amongst these is Wither, an ancient villain, whose massive but crumbling intellect hides behind a faade of amiable vagueness as he schemes his way towards ultimate power.Ending on this note, is it not strange and intriguing that a strong Christian apologist like professor Lewis should need to spice his calm beliefs with garnishes of magic, naturism and warlike demigods?"},{"Title":"That hideous strength,: A modern fairy-tale for grown-ups","review":"That Hideous Strength. That power of evil that desires to bring everything into submission to it. That draws men in to it, until they will have nothing else.In this fantastic close to C.S. Lewis's Space Trilogy, we continue to follow the activities of Ransom, as he and his friends fight a spiritual battle against the forces of evil. This time, the battle is on Earth, were a new organization, the National Institute of Coordinated Experiments (N.I.C.E), consults with demons through a terrible creature, and snakes its tentacles of influence into every aspect of England --- politics, religion, history, education, justice, and science --- all in the name of a better world. It also follows the struggles of a recently married couple, Mark and Jane Studdock, as Mark goes into the employ of N.I.C.E., and Jane joins the resistance.This climactic book follows in the tradition of its predecessors(Out of the Silent Planet, Perelandra), as it describes everyday occasions and phenomenal events with perfect imagery and cunning wit. You will be left wishing for more, and yet at the same time find yourself grateful that C.S. Lewis chose to give us a concise, refined, and matchless series in the Space Trilogy.Ryan RobledoAuthor of the Aelnathan:"},{"Title":"That hideous strength,: A modern fairy-tale for grown-ups","review":"Perhaps not the BEST of C. S. Lewis' works, but a good one nonetheless. I was introduced to the 'space trilogy' as a teenager by my father, a minister. He thought I would enjoy the SciFi aspect and maybe glean some ethical education in the meantime. He was correct. This was not the most fun of the trilogy to read, but a good ending to the trilogy. If you are looking for classic SciFi with good moral values, the 'space trilogy' is definitely worth a look."},{"Title":"That hideous strength,: A modern fairy-tale for grown-ups","review":"The masterful culmination of the Space Trilogy, \\"That Hideous Strength\\" will certainly raise the ire of feminists and moral relativists alike. They should read it anyway.Other reviewers have complained that \\"That Hideous Strength\\" doesn't seem to fit with the first two books of the trilogy. It's true that the plot of the third book is more complex, with far more characters, than the first two. Ransom, the hero of \\"Out of the Silent Planet\\" and \\"Perelandra,\\" does play a smaller role in this book. But the trilogy isn't about Ransom. It's about good vs. evil, humility vs. pride, obedience, rebellion, and a whole host of other light-dark juxtapositions. For this reason, readers who enjoyed the first two books from a purely science fiction standpoint, may be disappointed that they don't get to see more of Ransom.The real reason to read \\"That Hideous Strength\\" is for the seed of Christian philosophy embedded in it. The apparently \\"anti-womyn\\" theme so distasteful to zealous feminists is not degrading or insulting to women at all. Though one of the female protagonists, Jane, is instructed to \\"go [to her husband] in obedience, and you will find love,\\" there is nothing misogynistic or sexist about the plot. The theme of obedience (both the good kind and the bad kind) runs strong through this book, and is applied to both male and female characters. One of the more interesting ideas to chew on is the difference between the good obedience, and the bad obedience. Members of Ransom's household obey him, and he in turn obeys Maleldil. The exercise of free will is made clear in these relationships, which are good. But the obedience of Professor Frost and Deputy Director Wither of the New-World-Order-esque N.I.C.E. to dark spirits, and the obedience of other N.I.C.E. employees to them, is clearly obedience gone bad.This book is the stuff of many high school and college English theme papers. But that's not to say it can't be enjoyed for simply being a good fantasy tale. It's that, too."},{"Title":"That hideous strength,: A modern fairy-tale for grown-ups","review":"For the first half, at least, it is an absorbing look at the lure of power and the ever-unfolding &quot;Inner Ring&quot; (see that essay in the Weight of Glory compilation). Wither in particular is a chilling entity, one of the great characterizations. The novel lost me later on when it explained too much about Belbury, and then simultaneously confused me with the (far) less interesting goings on at St. Anne's. Here is a novel crying out to be excised and adapted into a great film, but alas, who is out there to film it? Speaking generally, Hollywood is unqualified to do anything but make a mess of it."},{"Title":"That hideous strength,: A modern fairy-tale for grown-ups","review":"I adore C.S. Lewis so much... so it pains me to say that I really, really disliked this book. The first time I attempted reading it, I got 90-something pages in, and then stopped. On my second attempt, I made it all the way through the 382 pages in about three weeks' time (that is a LONG time for me). For one, it was just boring. All of the fantastic imagination and vivid imagery from the first two books was non-existent in That Hideous Strength. It was like watching black-and-white TV. Secondly, I cared nothing for any of the characters. Not even Ransom. They were all dull and very wordy without saying much of anything at all. It was also quite a bit darker than the other two books, and many of the antagonists met gruesome ends. The allegory/theology/philosophy was also very difficult to follow. Of course I got the picture of the battle of good and evil, but as to the specifics, I don't have a clue."},{"Title":"That hideous strength,: A modern fairy-tale for grown-ups","review":"Taken by itself - which can be done without much issue - this is a good book. However, when positioned as the third installment of the Space Trilogy, it is a square peg being placed in a round hole. There are a number of things about this book that break the harmony with Out of the Silent Planet and Perelandra.1. Dr. Ransom is not the central figure of the story. There are vague references to him earlier in the book, but it is at almost the halfway point that we see Ransom interact with the rest of the characters. Some may find this similar to the way The Two Towers is written, but the big difference between the two is that all but one of the characters in The Hideous Strength are brand new. Even Devine is going by a different name. At least in The Two Towers, you were reading about familiar characters for the first half.2. The number of characters in this story is significantly large in comparison to the other two books in the trilogy. You meet as many characters in Bracton alone as you see in the entire length of Perelandra. That doesn't even take into consideration the characters at Logres and the N.I.C.E. This seems to take away from the cohesiveness of the Trilogy and almost detaches it from the other two stories.3. The role of the Oyarsa is quite different. Given that the story is set on Earth, this is somewhat expected. However, never having them speak just doesn't seem fair after their involvement in the other two stories. Lewis should have let the Oyarsa from Mercury and Saturn impart wisdom as Mars and Venus did.Again, this *is* a good book if you take it by itself. There are even some things related about the differences between men and women that are quite funny but true. Look for MacPhee's comparison of how the two sexes use nouns. Married people will get a chuckle. However, given that this is supposed to conclude a trilogy, it really fails in that regard. If you are expecting something that performs like Return of the King, you will be quite disappointed."},{"Title":"That hideous strength,: A modern fairy-tale for grown-ups","review":"I am a huge fan of most of C.S. Lewis' work. I had to force myself to finish this one. His view of life (esp in regard to the main female character) was SO offensive and sexist, I threw the book across the room several times. I wish I had never read it so I did not know how far his views on women and there place went. I guess according to him the largest sin of a women is to be independent and get a job. Give me a break."},{"Title":"That hideous strength,: A modern fairy-tale for grown-ups","review":"The conclusion to the trilogy, \\"Out of the Silent Planet\\" and \\"Perelandra\\". It can be read on its own, but there are moments when it was helpful to have read the previous two. \\"Perelandra\\" is by far the best of the three. I was disappointed there was no closure to the story. Lewis makes mincemeat of our feeble minds. His insights are amazing and his concept of the world beyond is exquisite. The English dialect can be slightly aggravating.The novel is centered around a university now owned and run by a group of intellectuals set out to change the world by the creation of a \\"new man\\". They created this new world order front to rid the world of undesirables, evoke a revolution upon the earth, and enforce a police state. The \\"worldly\\" Ransom is back, but not as one of the main characters. Instead, chosen is a man that is hired on by the university and his wife (who has dreams that are actually real), will together (though conditions separate them) create this \\"new man\\".Wish you wellScott"},{"Title":"That hideous strength,: A modern fairy-tale for grown-ups","review":"If you like C.
