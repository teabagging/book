You're easily halfway through before the realisation seeps in that this is a HELL of a ride you're going on, you have no clue what'll happen next, but look back and all you see is perfect necessity. You're in a maelstrom of whirling bits of dazzling colour, apparently unrelated, and before your very eyes they start to fit together in ways unimaginable and faster than you can grasp. The beauty and the terror just keep building up until your eyes start to tear with the unbearableness of it all. God, how it all fits together! The laughter strangled in my throat again and again because it was beyond funny. You can't even call it tragic any more. There are no words in the English language with enough of their original intensity left to describe what Vonnegut achieves with this book, at least for me. He does it perfectly, inimitably. Your vision is stretched so severely, your heart so laden with emotions with no name, you find yourself mute. Which is frustrating, because the first thing you want to do is evangelise about your newfound belief in humanity and great things like that, to deaf people eagerly armed with sharp, sharp pins."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Being an avid Vonnegut head, I hold this as one of my personal favorites.

Quotation marks are misplaced with the wrong sentences, spacing is incorrect, and so on. I e-mailed them about the problems but got no reply."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"This book isn't for everyone, that's for sure. The central theme is a fictional religion based around the principal that everything is a lie. The first line makes that clear. Characters include a midget, an introverted modelmaker who forced bugs to fight one another in his younger years, a man who is forced to make bicycles for blind people in Afghanistan, an insane elevator operator, a maniacal dictator, a sex symbol from a fictional island, the man who helped invent the atomic bomb (and has an odd fascination with turtles), a particularly destructive nihilist, and a doctor named \\"Breed\\", believed to have an affair. Some of the most memorable scenes involve all possible meanings of the term \\"Mayonnaise\\", fun with indexing, and a twenty-foot phallus used as a gravestone. Oh, and there are 127 chapters, each of them a page long on average.If all that just strikes you as weird, then Vonnegut really isn't the guy for you. The fact that this is normal in comparison to my favorite Vonnegut book, Breakfast of Champions, should say a lot about him. After all, this guy has one of the strangest senses of humor in literary history. His work really is inaccessible.I think he's great, though. He's got the same absurdist sense of humor as I do, and he's a social critic to rival the best of them. Especially here, where he mocks both science and religion, two very different fields. It's a hilarious book, but there's more to it than just the humor. There's also the underlying social and political implications, which is really what makes it fly.This isn't a good book in the traditional, \\"descriptive setting, fleshed-out characters\\" sense. I don't think it was meant to be. Instead, it's a wild, fast-paced ride, which moves from one biting indictment of society (he takes on everything from patriotism to nihilism). It's hilarious, it's enlightening, it's distinctive... it's pure Vonnegut."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Vonnegut's dark comedy masterpiece is one of the best books I've ever read. He successfully blends philosophy, science fiction, and humor to create an interesting and hilarious novel. In my opinion, this is the best book Vonnegut wrote, which is saying a lot considering his other triumphs. Anyone looking for a plot heavy book should probably look elsewhere. Vonnegut's novels focus much more on the characters and their traits (flaws, many times). This is a wonderful story about the nature of man and his tendencies towards destruction. The ending (while trashed by many other reviewers - perhaps they didn't get it) is one of the funniest and most chilling things I have ever read. This book is wonderful for its ability to make the reader look at oneself and laugh. A must read."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I wound up writing this review because recently, in a flight of fancy, someone conjectured that perhaps in other parts of the universe silicon forms four bonds, making ring structures - similar to the carbon-based benzene ring that is the basis of all organic materials - possible. My question was whether silicon-based amino-acid analogues would \\"teach\\" the silicon in this part of the universe to form the same kind of rings. Carbon-based DNA teaches raw amino acids how to make more DNA, so that begs the question of whether such structures would propagate.Ice-9 does just that.Cat's Cradle isn't quite as absurd as it seems.Ice-9 is a form of ice with a different structure than regular ice. It is frozen solid at room temperature. Further, when it comes into contact with regular water, it causes the water to freeze into more Ice-9. Given that 4/5ths of the earth's surface is covered by ocean, and that our bodies are mostly made of water, you can probably deduce that keeping the Ice-9 in a thermos where it can't come in contact with other water is an important plot element.A seed crystal is often necessary to initiate a phase change or precipitation, so it is conceivable that Ice-9 could initiate a catastrophe. The science fiction part is that we haven't discovered a form of water that is solid at room temperature.Incidentally, there's not much danger from oxygen-breathing silicon creatures because instead of exhaling carbon dioxide they'd exhale glass. They won't be bothering us here on earth when they show up.However, electricity-breathing silicon creatures like the semiconductor nodes that make up the Internet could be a threat. Google's server network has almost - not quite, but almost - reached a level of complexity where consciousness and intention are possible.Some reviewers on amazon.com thought that ice-9 was a metaphor for the atom bomb. Since the possibility of thermonuclear armageddon was so over-arching in real life at the time I first read the book, I didn't place any emtional emphasis on that subtext. I viewed Ice-9 as yet another technology to keep out of the hands of the military-industrial complex.You didn't need to know that Godzilla was a metaphor for the atom bomb and the damaging effects of residual radiation in order to enjoy it. Cat's Cradle was a fun social commentary that didn't benefit at all from atomic metaphor. Ice-9 was merely a plot device, a Deus-Ex-Machina that brought about the natural consequences of great social granfalloons.Bokononism isn't the first religion founded by a science-fiction author, either.Like all of Vonnegut's books, Cat's Cradle looks at society and personalities and relationships with a new, slightly mad perspective. It is hard to walk away from Cat's Cradle without re-evaluating the Granfalloon that is organized religion, or any other carefully-crafted social institutions."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Despite having read \\"Cat's Cradle\\" years ago, I recently found myself drawing a blank over the novel. I recalled that it was a 1960s doomsday satire (like Dr. Strangelove), a religious satire about a fake religion called Bokononism, and a political satire about a U.S. backed Caribbean dictatorship, San Lorenzo. Yet I couldn't quite recall what exactly Vonnegut was trying to say in this one, so I decided to reread it.The first theme of this book consists of Vonnegut's warnings about the awesome destructive force of science, and the abdication of moral responsibility by scientists. The plot centers around the deceased scientist Felix Hoenniker, a researcher at the General Forge and Foundry Company of Ilium, New York (modeled on Vonnegut's experiences at General Electric in Schenedtady), and winner of the Nobel Prize (\\"dynamite money\\"). Hoenniker was the father of the atomic bomb, and as if that isn't enough guilt for one man's soul (\\"how the hell innocent is a man who helps make a thing like an atomic bomb?\\"), he was also the developer of 'Ice-9', a form of ice with an elevated melting point. As Ice-9 has the potential to freeze the world's oceans, it is an even greater threat to humanity than the atom bomb. To Vonnegut, Hoenikker, and modern science and industry \\"receive honors and creature comforts while escaping human responsibilities.\\"The second major theme of Cat's Cradle is an exploration of false ideology. This is signified with the title string-trick, in which there is \\"no damn cat, no damn cradle\\". The book centers around a fabricated religion designed to give the impoverished people sustenance - one might say the opium of the masses, based around useful lies, or \\"foma'. Bokononism is itself sharply critical of the meaningless \\"granfaloons\\" that we use to divide and categorize people, including \\"the Communist Party, the Daughers of the American Revolution, the General Electric Company... and any nation, anytime, anywhere\\". Cornell University is another such granfaloon, as are \\"Hoosiers\\". Vonnegut is, as always, particularly derisive of American nationalism and militarism (e.g. \\"Fort Jesus\\"). Much of this criticism is conveyed through the unusual American Ambassador to San Lorenzo, Horlick Minton (\\"Perhaps when we remember wars we should take off all our clothes and... go on all fours all day long and grunt like pigs. That would surely be more appropriate than noble oratory and shows of flags and well-oiled guns\\"). And, as usual for Vonnegut, there are a number of jabs at capitalist ideology, mainly through the character of H. Lowe Crosby, who is in the process of relocating his bicycle factory to San Lorenzo, whose workers are impoverished and sufficiently terrified of the capital punishment doled out by dictator \\"Papa\\" Monzano, courtesy of \\"the hook\\". \\"No Communists here,\\" said Papa. \\"They fear the hook too much.\\" Bokononism is also a hook-worthy offense. Or more accurately, \\"Hy-u-ook-kuh!\\"I suppose the third major theme is Vonnegut's absurdist outlook on human existence. Says Bokonon: \\"Dyot meet mat\\", or \\"God made mud\\", \\"So God said to some of the mud, 'Sit up!'\\", \\"What interesting other kinds of sitting up mud I met!\\" Yet Vonnegut's humanism occasionally shines through the bleak outlook: \\"Think of what a paradise this world would be if men were kind or wise.\\""},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"This was the book that turned me on to Kurt Vonnegut. I've read all this novels since, but Cat's Cradle remains in many ways my favourite.

As far as I am concerned, this is Kurt Vonnegut's best book - way better than Slaughterhouse Five which seems to garner most of the attention. Very loosely put, this is the story of a man, a powerful doomsday invention, and the circle of people whose lives and fate are interconnected because of this invention. There is alot of made up terminology in the book - alot of fictitious mumbo jumbo - yet i find years later, i still find words like granfalloon and karass very relevant to my daily living. Trust me, there are alot of granfalloons out there!! Vonnegut very nicely satirizes society, especially in cold war era - but still relevant today - through a fictional almost farcical setting - that is brilliantly woven together through the seeming incoherence of it all! Loved it!"},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I first read this book when I was 12. My father gave it to me. He is a man of science and always quoted from it or praised it's subtlety and lifelong lessons that dwelt within. I didn't really understand it when I first read it. I picked it up a few weeks ago after my semester ended and blew through it in a single night. It isn't very long and can be conquered in a single sitting. I actually recommend reading it in one shot because the voices of each character will resonate more if they remain fresh.The sly humor and unique language of the book is it's greatest reward. Vonnegut has the rare gift of allowing the reader to engage in the subject matter even if it is heavily scientific or partially obscured by an intellectual layer that might be harder to penetrate if not for Vonnegut's expert hands.It's really impossible to describe any part of the plot without spoiling anything for a future reader. I'll just say this: you'll comprehend the limits of the human mind, heart, and the intricacies of the scientific stratum long after you turn the final page. A modern classic."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Cat's Cradle is by far the best Vonnegut novel that I have yet read. Blending his patented wry humor with acute social insight presented in an absurd fantasy world, Vonnegut has written an exceptional novel of love, lies, and the self destruction of mankind. The story centers around the narrator, Jonah, who is called by name once in the entire book. We are told in the beginning that he is writing a book on the events of the day the first atomic bomb was dropped on Japan. His research leads him to a correspondence with Newt Hoenikker, the midget son of Doctor Felix Hoenikker, father of the atomic bomb. After meeting with Newt, destiny leads our protagonist to the impoverished island republic of San Lorenzo, where among other adventures, he finds religion, falls in love, and becomes president. All of this by itself would make for a very entertaining book, but it is not in the story line that Vonnegut's genius lies. Cat's Cradle is rife with painfully accurate insights into the institutions that our society holds so dear, such as, religion, politics, and science. Vonnegut invents for the inhabitants of San Lorenzo a brand new religion based completely and admittedly on &quot;foma&quot;, or lies. This wouldn't be so shocking, except for the fact that this &quot;bokonism&quot; seems to make perfect sense. Other Vonnegut ironies pervade the book and are too elaborate to go into. Kurt Vonnegut is my favorite author of all time. Cat's Cradle is one of his funniest, most absurd, and frightening novels. This book truly causes one to stop and think about the things that one holds as unquestionably true. All of the incredible people, places, things, and ideas in Cat's Cradle are intricately woven into a perfect tapestry that sums up and spells out many of mankind's self-created problems in 191 pages."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I don't like sci-fi, but I loved this. This is the first Vonnegut I've read (I took a chance after reading so much praise for it) and it definitely won't be the last. It's one of those rare and wonderful books in the same vein as Animal Farm: simple prose, easy to read, yet with ironic tinges and thought-provoking depths; a novel that can be read and enjoyed at many different levels.Cat's Cradle is narrated through Jonah, an author who aims to write a book on the single day the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima. On investigating the atomic bomb's main founding father (and his three children) he is told about a *non-existant* substance with the capacity to provide all water on earth with a different molecular structure, turning it into Ice 9 (ie, a substance that could bring about the end of the world) A different assignment takes Jonah to the small island of San Lorenzo where he encounters Felix Hoenikker's three children and a society where the religion of choice (a religion that everyone knows is based on lies, yet still has utter faith in) is punishable by death, for the simple fact that it adds excitement to the dull lives of the inhabitants. I won't go any further...The thing that delighted me most about this book was the way in which it was written. A lot of great and influential books are ones that (on the whole) you enjoy, but take a while to get into, and at times you feel like giving up on: you know the book in question is good literature, but the style and plot make finishing it seem a chore.Similarly, a lot of fast-paced books hold little impact, don't challenge the mind and are forgotten the instant you read them.Kurt Vonnegut has managed to write a powerful and memorable novel in a short, snappy style: this book has everything that makes a compelling, challenging read. Vonnegut lets you get a feel for the characters without going into lengthy descriptions, he manages to make sharp, subtle criticisms of religion, human nature and society without rambling or whining, his plot is exciting yet not unrealistic, he creates a hellish world that plays on everyone's fear of obliteration in precious few words. I thought the ending was too abrupt, but it fitted well with the rest of the story (and it would have been even more disappointing if he'd created a satisfying, everything-tied-up-nicely ending)I found this impossible to put down, and highly recommend it to any fan of literature."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Vonnegut writes the book with the question that &quot;God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater&quot; plays with on a different level, all the while throwing in philosophies, wit, and things to ponder on and about during the COLD WAR.The narrator (first-person incompetent) is somewhat vacant, and being so, maneuvers the story the best way possible.The narrator is writing a book on the atomic bomb and he travels about meeting strange people who know the creators of the bomb. The characters he meets are funny and strange (You would have to be an oddball to be toying with doomsday.). In his journey he finds the sons and daughter of the inventor of the A-bomb. He finds that these three are an eccentric and foolish trio. The daughter and sons hold with them ice-nine, a weapon that makes the a-bomb seem infantile. Ice-nine was an attempt by their father to make battlefields (mud) solidify, making battle easier on soldiers. It winds up making any moisture it touches solid and blue, but its one flaw is, once put into the atmosphere it regenerates without stopping, freezing everything in its path(including human beings).Vonnegut throws in the element of Bokononism, a quirky, weird religion spawned by an eccentric, self-made prophet named Bokonon. This angle plays in the mind of the reader as it debases the relevancy of all religions, thus, for example, making Catholicism or Islam just as strange as Bokononism. Bokononists chant about man being born of the &quot;mud.&quot;Symbolically the three children holding ice-nine, a single flake of which will end mankind as we know it, stand for three world superpowers. It shows that anyone, no matter how high in power, can be foolish, and should have no access to such an element of destruction. The ice-nine is just a symbol of the end of mankind through the folly of science, for the ice-nine turns things bluish white, like ice--putting man in another ice-age, destroying all &quot;mud&quot;. The island of San Lorenzo is like Cuba--through its history no one really cared about anyone else ceasing it, but since there is an odd belief there(Bokononism/Communism),people poke around there now. It shows how such a small place, like Cuba, in the Cold War, could be ground-zero for the end of humanity, and warns against intervention there.Being that the Cold War is over, this is an era piece that some may think is stagnate. Yet the tools to end civilization are still out there, so this book is relevant as long as science and government have and look for a greater means of destruction.Though this book is funny and eccentric on surface, it is ultimately found to be a political warning. This humorous look at what could be the end, parallels Orwell's &quot;Nineteen-Eighty-Four&quot; in the field of political writing for the sake of warning (Orwell warns about the threat of Totalitarianism, Vonnegut warns about man's acute closeness to his own demise). This book is not as hard-nosed as &quot;Nineteen-Eighty-Four.&quot; It is funny, but this is done to show the folly and incompetence that mankind's demise is handled with: Vonnegut's use of juxtaposition is without flaw.Bokonon adds a religious facet to this novel. He ultimately shows folly and incompetence in the creation of something other than doomsday devices--religion. After the reader drops the hypocrisy of thinking their religion is &quot;the one,&quot; Vonnegut brings up the question: Were people like Jesus or Mohammed just fools out spreading nonsense for the sake of an ego-trip?This book touches on so many intense questions. It puts forth a vehicle for such deep introspection, yet it is hilarious. I only wish I were to have read this in the mind set of the world in the early sixties, when this book was first published. Vonnegut was way ahead of his time with this one. His writing, when dissected, makes me think he is one of the great thinkers of the twentieth-century into the twenty-first..."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"If you've never read Kurt Vonnegut before, then you face a slight dilemma. You have two options available to you (well, really you've got more than two, but as long as you're reading this, I'm running the show and I say you've only got two):1) You can read a slew of other Vonnegut books and build up to reading &quot;Cat's Cradle,&quot; or2) You can read &quot;Cat's Cradle&quot; and be so entirely blown away that no Vonnegut book will ever again live up to your newly inflated expectations.That said, &quot;Cat's Cradle&quot; is an absolute must read for anyone and everyone over the age of birth. To summarize Vonnegut's crazy, whacked out plot would be an exercise in futility: it's got something to do with the father of the atomic bomb and his three bizarre children and the narrator who will chronicle their story as they get mixed up with the inhabitants of the island of San Lorenzo, all of whom are Bokononists. Confused yet? You should be. Throw in a little bit of ice-nine, a chemical that can feasibly bring about the end of the world, and you might have a slight inkling of the pieces of Vonnegut's puzzle.Still, for all of the crazy characters and situations in &quot;Cat's Cradle,&quot; it's ultimately a brilliant satire of the Cold War; at one particular moment a character realizes the importance of dichotomies, why we must believe the other is &quot;evil&quot; for us to be able to see ourselves as &quot;good&quot; and how absurd such things are, how phony and constructed they are. At the heart of all this is Vonnegut's brilliant metaphor for the cat's cradle, and it's a beauty.Even if all this political satire doesn't grab you, just the way in which Vonnegut manages to throw a dozen ridiculous balls in the air and keep them well juggled and catch them all with grace by the final page is testament to his skill. &quot;Cat's Cradle&quot; is a book that'll make you sit up and think, but will also make you laugh out loud and maybe even touch you emotionally, particularly during the American ambassador to San Lorenzo's speech. It's so gut wrenching and absurd and oh so wonderfully written that you'll be hooked before you even realize it. Read it; this is as good as it gets."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"This was my first time reading Vonnegut, and I bought this novel largely based on his reputation as an author and the reviews I read here. The premise of the novel also sounded interesting. The narrator, Jonah, is writing a book about the events that took place on the day the atomic bomb was dropped, and focuses on the \\"father\\" of the atomic bomb, Felix Hoenikker, and his children. He eventually finds himself on the fictional island of San Lorenzo amid the backdrop of political and religious instability.I could tell right away that Vonnegut was an excellent author. That is clear from his writing, which is very elegant and well organized. The book is a short read at 300 pages, and with chapters at 1-2 pages long, most people will be through it in a few hours. The chapters all flow into each other and there is no \\"jumping around\\" between other characters, as Jonah narrates the story through the first person.Those are the positives and the reason I gave Cat's Cradle three stars. I believe this is a good book and likely an intellectual commentary on society and the arms race, etc etc, however all of this must have gone completely over my head because I didn't see any of it. Maybe this book is \\"too\\" intellectual for me, since I am not used to having to think so much while reading. What's more, the satire also went over my head and I do not recall any humorous moments in the entire book, and kept looking for the plot.I do not mean for this review to turn people off of Cat's Cradle, just to let them know what they are getting into. If your usual fare is Tom Clancy, Stephen King, J.K. Rowling, etc, and you are not used to writers like Vonnegut, Douglas Adams, Chuck Palahniuk (this book reminded me a LOT ofSurvivor: A Novel), you may find you are missing out on most of the actual book. I was not disappointed when I finished Cat's Cradle, but I certainly wasn't as satiated as I usually am when I finish a good novel. Caveat emptor."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Cat's Cradle is completely amazing. One of Vonnegut's best. Plenty of other reviews will tell you that, though. Just make sure you buy the right edition. As you may have noticed, there are two editions available in the Kindle store- one published by \\"Rosetta Books\\" for $7.19 (the first search result for \\"Cat's Cradle\\" in the store with an orange and white cover) and one for $5.59 (the third result with a blue cover and a picture of a bird cage). While I'm sure any sane person would buy the cheaper edition anyway, if you accidentally buy the more expensive edition like I did you will be thoroughly annoyed. For some reason, when a quotation mark appears mid-line the space before it is deleted and a space after it is added. For example:We had locked \\"Papa's\\" doorappears asWe had locked\\" Papa's\\" doorWhile it's easy to figure out most of the time, if you're not paying terribly close attention or if a line is continued from a previous page, it can be hard to tell whether a quote is beginning or ending.I called customer service and they sorted it out immediately, refunding my money and allowing me to purchase the cheaper, less flawed edition. Service was great, but I didn't realize there was another edition until I was 87% through the book. It wasn't the end of the world, but watch out. I wouldn't download anything else from Rosetta Books either.In conclusion, buy the cheaper version. You won't be disappointed. Cat's Cradle is great, especially if you're a Vonnegut enthusiast already."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"\\"Don't be a fool! Close this book at once! It is nothing but foma! [lies]\\"In \\"The Cat's Cradle,\\" Vonnegut provides an ironic and satiric look at religion, science, and ethics. The storyline consists of John and his attempts at researching Felix Hoenikker, one of the fathers of the atomic bomb, as he attempts to write a book about Hiroshima. Although Vonnegut's novel is intended as humorous, a powerful message lies beneath the surface. Vonnegut explores the purpose and role of religion, and delves into the philosophical debate on science and ethics.Bokononism, the religion of a tiny banana republic, San Lorenzo, is the central focus in Vonnegut's expose on religion. Bokonon, its founder, was shipwrecked onto this tiny island and, with the help of McCabe, attempts to transform the backward and exploited island into a utopia. When this proves impossible, Bokonon invents his religion. Although admitting that Bokononism is \\"nothing but lies,\\" it provides a distraction to the San Lorenzoans and inspires meaning and fulfillment in their lives of misery. Although the Books of Bokonon are predicated on blatant falsehoods, its devotion and practice provide the reason for existence for the impoverished San Lorenzoans, even with the specter of capital punishment to those who practice it. Even their dictator is an adamant follower. The essence of Vonnegut's philosophy is best illustrated in the Bokononist tale of creation, in which a playful God tells man that his purpose in life is to figure out what that purpose is, for the implicit message is that there is no grand purpose or plan for life.The symbolism of the \\"Cat's Cradle\\" further illustrates this point. A game played with string by children, this was the game played by Felix Hoenikker on the day the bomb was dropped on Hiroshima. This had such an impact on Newt, his youngest son, that he later creates an abstract painting of the cat's cradle, then laments how maddening this game is, for it nothing but a \\"bunch of X's\\": \\"No d--n cat, no d--n cradle.\\" This illusory game symbolizes that life has no true purpose, much like the X-shaped strings that form nothing tangible.In John's pursuit of Felix, he discovers that, although he may have had a brilliant scientific mind, he failed to take responsibility or to see any danger in his work. Although Felix had no malicious or odious intents when he worked on the bomb, he also exhibited no remorse at its implications. He was far from innocent. His lack of ill intent was not enough, as it was his responsibility to restrain what he unleashed on the world. He viewed his work as pure research and nothing more. Indeed, his very last invention, Ice-9, which has the frightening implications of destroying all earthly life, was worked on as a hobby. He took no moral view of the implications of his work and selfishly failed to see beyond his own self-fulfillment. Through Felix, Vonnegut sends a powerful message that it is the moral obligations of scientists and engineers to be accountable for the potentially destructive nature of their work.Penned in the early 1960s, \\"The Cat's Cradle\\" does contain some campy sci-fi elements. The scientific explanation of Ice-9 seems quite a stretch, even for a 1960s sci-fi novel parody. Furthermore, most of the characters are one-dimensional caricatures of an abstract group. There is no real character development. However, this was not Vonnegut's main purpose, which was to illustrate the inherent evil of irresponsible scientists and the fallacy of religion. In these respects, Vonnegut delivers.Overall, this is an easy read, but is entertaining and thought-provoking."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I once heard Kurt Vonnegut speak at a commencement ceremony at a Bennington College in Vermont in 1970, when his daughter was graduating with a bachelor's degree. He spoke quite eloquently about what graduates should do with their lives, and I remember parts of that wonderful speech as if it were yesterday. Indeed, Kurt Vonnegut is a writer of prodigious talents, a visionary seer disguised as an ordinary man, a contemporary wise man who speaks to us in amusing yet frightening allegories about the nature of contemporary man and the absurd technological culture he lives in today. This book, \\"Cat's Cradle\\", is among his finest novels, like most of his others, a work combining a wry sensibility with an amusing ability to confect sweet sounding yet bitter-tasting tales of mayhem and woe.The plot of Cats Cradle is pure science fiction, and revolves around work to create a way to help American tanks more mobile in rain soaked and muddy circumstances, when such an ability to transverse the impossible terrain would give our guys in their tanks an overwhelming advantage over their evil foes. Our protagonist is a scientist working on isotope of water (called Ice -9) that has the ability to crystallize water into a unique form of ice that does not need freezing temperatures to crystallize. With such a capability, the Army could solidify the water in the mud, making it firm and allowing our tanks to roll over it with impunity. The problem is that once introduced into the ground, the compound has untoward effects no one had considered. And the basis for the cautionary tale is spun.All of this is just the premise that allows Vonnegut to explore the far reaches of human behavior and the insane ways in which our culture is operating. It is a brilliant work, one that delves into the deep recesses of what we are, why we are that way, and where we seem to be going. It is at once a satire, a running commentary on the nature of our institutions, and the way in which we lie, cheat, and pretend to be people we are not, and as in his wild and wacky novel \\"Mother Night\\", shows why you should be afraid of who it is you are pretending to be, for it may come back to haunt you. This book literally explodes with a plethora of stinging insights into contemporary society, and constitutes a brilliant, albeit ironic, diagnosis of what a contradiction it is to be a human being trying to live a sane life in an insane world. This really is magical mystery tour, and one that will take your breath away. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Kurt Vonnegut is nothing short of a magician. Call him a writer if you must, but it seems unfitting for a man who weaves yarns about new religions, Ukranian midget dancers, apocalyptic chemical inventions, and feet-rubbing fornication. Writer just doesn't do justice.Regardless, Cat's Cradle is a wonderful read and a heck of a time. Plot, character, and setting, as always in Vonnegut's work, take a back seat to the infectuos humor and unconventional writing style of its author.The narrator is named Jonah, a writer who wishes to conduct a non-fiction story revolving the lives of people surrounding the Atom Bomb titled \\"The Day The World Ended\\". From this moment, our wild ride begins as we are introduced to the great cast of characters, including Dr. Felix Hoenikker, one of the so-called \\"Fathers\\" of the Atom Bomb, who may or may not have created a chemical capable of turning all the worlds water supply into ice, his family, the president(dictator)of a small Pacific Island San Marcos, Papa Manzano, and his lovely daughter, all the way down to Bokonon himself, founder of the Bokonon faith which is based in foma (lies). The journey through Vonnegut's mind is a worthwile one, if nothing else for his startling creativity, and hilariously bleak view at humanity. I will leave you with this quote from the great books of Bokonon:\\"Beware of the man who works hard to learn something, learns it, and finds himself no wiser than before. He is full of murderous resentment of people who are ignorant without having come by their ignorance the hard way.\\"Well said."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Cat's Cradle is by far the best Vonnegut novel that I have yet read. Blending his patented wry humor with acute social insight presented in an absurd fantasy world, Vonnegut has written an exceptional novel of love, lies, and the self destruction of mankind. The story centers around the narrator, Jonah, who is called by name once in the entire book. We are told in the beginning that he is writing a book on the events of the day the first atomic bomb was dropped on Japan. His research leads him to a correspondence with Newt Hoenikker, the midget son of Doctor Felix Hoenikker, father of the atomic bomb. After meeting with Newt, destiny leads our protagonist to the impoverished island republic of San Lorenzo, where among other adventures, he finds religion, falls in love, and becomes president. All of this by itself would make for a very entertaining book, but it is not in the story line that Vonnegut's genius lies. Cat's Cradle is rife with painfully accurate insights into the institutions that our society holds so dear, such as, religion, politics, and science. Vonnegut invents for the inhabitants of San Lorenzo a brand new religion based completely and admittedly on &quot;foma&quot;, or lies. This wouldn't be so shocking, except for the fact that this &quot;bokonism&quot; seems to make perfect sense. Other Vonnegut ironies pervade the book and are too elaborate to go into. Kurt Vonnegut is my favorite author of all time. Cat's Cradle is one of his funniest, most absurd, and frightening novels. This book truly causes one to stop and think about the things that one holds as unquestionably true. All of the incredible people, places, things, and ideas in Cat's Cradle are intricately woven into a perfect tapestry that sums up and spells out many of mankind's self-created problems in 191 pages. --This text refers to the Mass Market Paperback edition."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Among the many Kurt Vonnegut books I have read, this was the first one and today still remains to be my favorite book by him and perhaps of all time. While I believe \\"Cat's Cradle\\" to be Vonnegut's best piece of literature he has many other great stories and \\"Cat's Cradle\\" works as a great introduction to his style and humor. What separates Vonnegut's satire from those of lesser authors is the wit and black humor that is embedded in every page. With the eccentric and eclectic cast of characters, notably a midget, Vonnegut is able to comment on all of the faults of the modern man while still maintaining the humor which makes the book very easy to pick up and even harder to put down once started. \\"Cat's Cradle\\" can be read in two ways: as a humorous warning apocalpytic tale of a man at the end of the world, or as an in depth look at the plight of man and the many pitfalls of our society. Neither way is wrong because the book fits both instances so well that it's hard to find any fault with it; it's neither too serious or too goofy. In fact it's this balance of seriousness and humor that makes Vonnegut's writing so enticing and enjoyable. If you enjoy apocalyptic stories, social commentaries, and clever and subtle humor then you will find \\"Cat's Cradle\\" to be highly enjoyable journey and will re-visit it many times throughout the years."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"This book was pure comic genius using dark ironic humor. One of the greatest books ever. I love it so much all of you should read it!"},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Length:: 1:54 Mins"},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"The end of the world has always been a difficult topic for discussion, probably because there is no saying when or how it will take place. In 'Cat's Cradle\\" by Kurt Vonnegut, it is a topic that keeps coming up. And if you are at all familiar with Vonnegut's dark humor, you would not be surprised. The cause? Religion verses science. It starts when the main character, John Hoosier (who is telling this story in the first person) is researching for a book to be called \\"The Day the World Ended,\\" about Dr. Felix Hoenikker, the man behind the atomic bomb. This sparks a fascination, and leads him to contact this late scientist's children.This book is full or random coincidences that seem to make no sense when you are reading it, but they all come together in the end. All the characters, seeming slightly exaggerated, are not at all what you would expect. There is a radical religious figure, Bokonon, and a Minister of science, Frank, who are all thrown together with ICE-NINE, a chemical that freezes everything upon contact. The world ends when they are all on San Lorenzo, a made up island with a murderous dictator. It is very fun and also interesting."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Fascinating story that puts forth some very interesting ideas on the purpose of religious belief. Highly Recommended. Quotes from the text: \\"All of the true things that I am about to tell you are shameless lies.\\" \\"Anyone who cannot understand how useful a religion based on lies can be will not understand this book either.\\" \\"Live by the harmless untruths that make you brave and kind and healthy and happy.\\""},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Kurt Vonnegut weaves a darkly funny web of simultaneously tragic and quirky events. I loved the characters, who not only echo the implications of the themes presented in the novel (notably the lies people tell themselves and others to remain happy) but feel human and not just literary tools. The ending still has me thinking, and yes, as others have mentioned, it does end quite abruptly, however, I think that is appropriate. Read it - you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Vonnegut's novel takes the reader into the myriad faces of human emotions--from disenchantment to awe, skepticism to empathy, from horror and madness to succor and redemption. This dryly humorous and unforgivingly scathing story of the seemingly inevitable tendency of humans to think up of ways to destroy themselves, or, simply, to make complete wretches of their lives, is at times too incredulous to be taken seriously, and yet the author has managed to slip in some amazingly straightforward insights people nowadays would probably hardly acknowledge readily, too preoccupied we are with the superfluous things in life.I certainly enjoyed Cat's Cradle with its memorable zany characters, unashamed views on tolerance, hypocrisy, and even religion. It takes a jab at the senselessness of war, the farcical stage that is politics, and ponders the possibility that life can be lived so simply but it seems that that idea for us nowadays is too complex to grasp.Makes the reader sit back and think while still helplessly embroiled in the world of \\"Bokononism\\" and the twists and turns of fate the narrator was dealt with. A veritable tour de force."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"The cat's cradle is an extraordinary tale about the extent of human limitations when incompatibilities exist between the goals of science and humanity. Vonnegut created another masterpiece that describes the dangers of human science when mixed with their desires and lewdness.John, the narrator, is writing a book about the day the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, and in the process of his research discovers the life of Felix Hoenikker, the Nobel prize-winning physicist and one of the creators of the atomic bomb.Similar to walking through a hilarious human maze, we are taken to San Lorenzo; a town were Hoenikker's two sons and daughter live and ignorantly use their father's last invention causing another world wide human disaster.Vonnegut brilliantly shows human limitations and foolishness with his description of an imaginary religion called Bokononism, which originated and blossomed in San Lorenzo.Vonnegut, who survived the cruelty of war and faced life's emptiness, is one of the few writers who can laugh at the human inability to reconcile the inherent conflict of science's power and capabilities with the needs and limitations of humanity."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Enough zaniness and dark humor permeate Cat's Cradle to keep a reader entertained, but there's still a point to Vonnegut's odd comedy--the destruction and danger of nuclear-type weapons, the criticism of society and their motives, and the general stupidity of mankind. To say Vonnegut takes a pessimistic viewpoint might be an understatement, but at least he can have fun doing it. In many respects, I actually found Cat's Cradle to be a little more enjoyable than Slaughter House Five, which seemed to be a little darker in nature.The story begins with Jonah studying and researching the late Felix Hoenikker, a renown scientist responsible for producing the atom bomb and a dangerous liquid substance called ice-nine. To do this, he interviews various people and colleagues of the late doctor, finding out, while Hoenikker had innocent intentions, he was careless with both his family and his inventions. In his quest, Jonah comes to identify Dr. Hoenikker's three children--Newt, Angela and Frank--a very odd group of kids. Angela is very tall and lanky and has to play the role of parent because of her father's neglect. Newt is a midget, who comes to find love with a midget Russian performer. And Frank leaves the family, disappears, and later emerges in San Lorenzo, being the supposed architect of San Lorenzo's \\"master plan.\\" Eventually Jonah and a group (including Angela and Newt) embark on a trip to San Lorenzo to see the island of San Lorenzo, it's population \\"all fiercely dedicated to the ideals of the Free World\\" (Jonah learns from the pamphlet on the plane). The irony of much of what is discovered on this island is that the people's religion--Bokonon--is mostly based on lies (as it says in its introduction). From here, Jonah becomes adjusted to the people and their customs, meets the island's dictator, \\"Papa\\", hears more rumors about the mysterious Bokonon, falls in love with a goddess-like woman Mona, and becomes president of San Lorenzo (he learns from Frank that this is his ultimate destiny, or his \\"zah-mah-ki-bo\\"). Eventually, there is a major event that Jonah must deal with, and this happens at the book's conclusion. Wacky as it is, the plot seems to be just a vehicle to get across much of Vonnegut's satirical points about human existence.Much of the fun of this book is the exceptional comic voice by Vonnegut. He can seemingly take the most serious issues, like religion, politics, nuclear threats, and turn them upside down. One bizarre part is when Julian Castle looks at Newt's \\"Cat's Cradle\\" painting (which Newt professes should hold a message for everyone), regards it as \\"garbage\\" and throws it out into the waterfall. A moment prior to this Jonah had been musing over the painting's meaning, and this act by Castle seems to fit right into the nonsensical mentality of the island. There is also the \\"last rites\\" scene with \\"Papa\\" and Jonah, where \\"Papa\\" leans over and whispers to Jonah to tell Bokonon that he is sorry he didn't kill him and his philosophy of lies.If you can take all of the author's jabs in a light way then this will be an enjoyable read; if not, then you might want to pass, or at least sample the book before purchasing. I wished I would have read this one before reading Slaughter House Five (as Cat's Cradle works better for an introduction to the author)."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"This book is full of whimsical humor. It's one of the few books that made me laugh out loud. Ironically, it's also incredibly pessimistic. Humanity is doomed by its own depraved nature to a farcical apocalypse. For Vonnegut, the main culprits are scientists who show no concern for the destructive applications of their inventions. Their scientific method is the only road to knowledge but (more pessimism) cannot yield moral knowledge or wisdom. Nothing can, including religion, which is 'all lies'."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I've read a couple of Vonnegut books before and I really enjoyed them. To say Vonnegut is quirky might either be a compliment or not taking it far enough. First off, this is a quick read. Also, it's a fun read. The characters are unique and even the main character is likable and that's sometimes hard to portray in 1st person writing styles. When I looked online to see the synopsis of what the book was about, every description tells you more about Vonnegut and what he's alluding to rather than what the book is actually about. That's because this book is kind of hard to describe. There is a main story here for sure. However, the hardest part of reading this book is actually to understand what to get out of it. I think there's some commentary on religion and the Cold War (literally in this book). But, with reading Vonnegut's other books that I have, I knew what he wanted me to take away from it. Here, that's a little harder. I'm sure that undercuts me as a reader rather than Vonnegut as an author. Still, I had fun reading it and it would be interesting to see what other people took away from it.

Cat's Cradle forefronts two main themes: (1) humanity has an insurmountable tendency to destroy itself and (2) nothing really matters anyway. Telling the story of a random set of characters thrown together by an inexorable sense of chance, chaos ensues and we laugh all the way to the end of the world. Science, in this book, is not your friend (scientists even less so) and religion, though a heap of lies, is a little more friendly when taken with a healthy grain of salt.in all, the book is good. great even. worth a read and certainly enlightening. but, like Salinger, Vonnegut embraces an incredible cynicism. the sarcasm makes it a bit more fun, but there is little redeemable at the end of the narrative. just take you poison and bid goodnight."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"While I perhaps understood the overall point of the novel (i.e. that science may be truth but it can and will destroy man; whereas, a system of bliefs such as Bokonism allows man to live in harmony even if this peace and harmony is built on harmless untruths), I think Vonnegut could have done a better job at telling the story. The story \\"bounced around\\" a bit too much for me and as a reader, I did not know what to focus on, and after a while, did not care. Unlike Slaughterhouse Five, I did not find this book at all funny (was it supposed to be?) although I suspect that Vonnegut intended the reader to take humor in the medical condition known as midgetism.

That being said, I did have a few problems with this - one of the core lessons that it teaches is one of pointlessness, and that gets applied somewhat to aspects within the plot line; certain events take place that could be seen as deus ex machinas, but at times some of them are pointed out, how they are unexplained, and their explanations dismissed as unnecessary. It can come off as either smart, funny and very honest, or as somewhat lazy. I didn't feel like I gained as much from this as I did Slaughterhouse-Five, but that's not to say that I didn't gain anything at all - on the contrary, I found it to be very enriching, in the most ironic way possible.

Kurt Vonnegut traces the story of Lionel Boyd Johnson (recognize the initials), the story of a man washed ashore on a Caribbean island to find his match in the island's self appointed not-so-evil major domo. What's lacking on this island? According to the dictator's limited exposure to philosophy (Charles Atlas' theory of Dynamic Tension -- retrieved from the back of a childhood comic book), what's missing is a kind and gentle counterpart, a false religious leader who can divert the attention of island residents from the poverty surrounding them. He empowers Mr. Johnson, renamed Bokonon, who enchants island residents with his restated version of the creation, written in \\"calypsos\\", a lyrical guide to just how God manages to gets things done.

I won't spoil the plot, but suffice it to say that this apocolyptic satire of religion and science; predestination and free will; ice and ice 9; is brilliant throughout. There's a reason that this book holds cult status with Vonnegut fans around the world; read it, you'll get it!Reading the rest of the Vonnegut catalogue now just crushes me, because nothing lives up to his big three titles.

He becomes completely immersed in the lives of the Hoenikker family and joins a religious cult, whose fundamental beliefs are based on lies. Vonnegut is so obscure; thus rather than clearly stating facts, many important points of this story are magically dispersed throughout the background.

It's a pretty fast-paced read (there are 127 short chapters). The themes covered (religion, meaning of life, end of world, government, war) were right up my alley and I found myself agreeing with the author's observations. The style of the writing is very modern and it feels like it could have been written today.

You follow a character named Jonah. He follows a scientist, Dr. Hoenikker, who creates the atomic bomb and Ice 9. You move to multiple locations following multiple story lines. You move to an island called San Lorenzo. In San Lorenzo there is not much money and everyone is starving. The only people that are not starving are the people that are not locals. The profiteers that come from America are the people that are not starving. One example of one of these people is H. Lowe Crosby, a bicycle maker. This book is a story of many things, it has many lessons to learn from it. I would highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"A brilliant novel capitalizing on that hidden layer of life in which the Creator has subtly and mysteriously connected everyone to someone else. It begins with the writer of a story and culminates in the end of all life on Earth. I wasn't enraptured with the text so much as I was driven to greater depths of curiosity for what came next, two-pages at a time."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Before I say anything about the book, I have to say that I chose to read this book from a rather short list for a school project in Essay Writing. That being said, I loved the book.Almost every single book that I have needed to read for school rubbed me the wrong way for one reason or another. The most common is that it was too boring. Cat's Cradle defies that and was instantly put near the top of my book list that I recommend to people.I was hooked after reading the first two chapters in the book, which for Cat's Cradle total four or five pages. The chapter were amazingly short, some only a few pages in length. To me, this made to book feel like it was going by really fast. I read through the book in only a few days (books usually take me a few weeks in contrast).Vonnegut's use of sarcasm and satire is made me laugh out loud and question the stability of our government. He dives into the tangled nature of science and religion and embeds doubt into the reader.I am a total science fiction and a science geek and when I heard from my teacher this had a sci-fi aspect, I jumped on it. I am pleased with how the sci-fi part of the novel and the regular part of the novel are balanced and mixed with each other.Overall I rate this book very high, hence the five stars. I recommend this book to everybody that I meet, even total strangers because of the awesome factor of the book."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Cat's Cradle by Kurt Vonnegut, chronicles John, a man searching for answers about the atomic bomb dropping on Hiroshima and Nagasaki during World War II. Throughout the book John meets a variety of people from scientists to the children of the creator of the atomic bomb. Vonnegut pokes fun at aspects of human nature such as religion, greed, and sin all in a manner that will keep the reader laughing throughout the novel. Vonnegut makes accurate satirical comments about many groups and institutions that Americans follow blindly. For example, John claims he was once a Bokonon, and throughout the book he searches for the members of his karass. In the end, he finds Lionel Johnson, the final member of his karass and the creator of Bokononism, only to find out that Johnson thinks religion is a complete waste of time! Vonnegut's dry humor makes the decisions of humans seem almost idiotic and the ridiculous scenarios he creates cause the reader to truly question human nature. The use of ice-nine at the end of the book displayed the greedy nature of human beings to simply do whatever best suits them without worrying about the greater good of a population.Cat's Cradle is definitely an interesting and fun read. It can be finished quickly and it definitely has a lot to enjoy. If you get the chance I would absolutely recommend reading this hilarious, satirical novel."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Cat's Cradle is a wonderful story craftily told. Vonnegut's writing style is simple and straightforward. There are surprises in every chapter, laughs, and a type of bravado only dreamed of in lesser writers. Cat's Cradle has inspired me to seek out other Vonnegut titles."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I read this book years ago and reread it recently. It is excellent. In truth, Vonnegut was sporadically a very good writer, but not a great writer. This is his very best book, and the only one that has stuck with me over the expanse of time. He himself gave it an A+, while being objectively hard on most of his other books.Its fun, its thoughtful, its a fast read. And it stuck with me over 30 years to be one of the very few books that I wanted read a second time. That proved to be a good choice.I recommend it to the many others out there who read Vonnegut years ago, and to the young readers who never did."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Ah, Cat's Cradle. A heartwarming tale of petty family rivalries, a calypso-based religion openly full of lies, an absurd arms race over ice, and the end of all life on the planet. Cat's Cradle is the book that really put Vonnegut on the map, and it's not hard to see why; even all these years later, it's a marvelous mix of storytelling and barbed satire, one all the more remarkable for how light the whole thing seems on a cursory reading. I don't think Cat's Cradle holds a candle to Vonnegut's later work - it's more conventional, in its own strange way, and more bound to a story than to Vonnegut's more rambling works, which is what I love most about him. What's more, Cat's Cradle is a little sprawling - it ends up handling so much that the points aren't as sharp as you might like. But those are faint complaints for a book that packs so much into so few pages, and the fact that it still can pack an unironic emotional wallop in moments (I'm thinking here particularly of the speech before the ceremony at the end) is just more testament to Vonnegut's amazing mind and writing. And as for people who say the book is nothing but hopelessness and bitterness - I don't see how you can read Cat's Cradle and not see that Vonnegut may be a cynic, but he's one who finds it all funny, not depressing, and his bemused laughter at all the insanity is what made him such a joy."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"My fifth Kurt Vonnegut novel in two weeks now, i began with Breakfast of Champions and have not been able to put down his books since, another truly great novel for fans of the author, and for newcomers alike"},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"This apocalyptic novel by one of America's greatest satirical writers is an interesting view of what the end of the world may be like. The hero, John (Johah, as he calls himself), begins work on a book about the bombing of Hiroshima, and ends up getting mixed up in the lives of the A-bomb's principal inventor's children. Interestingly enough, the man who was most responsible for the atomic bomb is also largely to blame for the final destruction of human life.Vonnegut may be a fatalist, and he certainly is a pessimist. His bleak view of mankind, of science, of religion (as exemplified by the outrageous theology he creates) is nothing short of a wake-up call. Vonnegut is immensely entertaining, and anyone who enjoyed Slaughterhouse Five or any of his other novels is sure to be pleased with this book. Dark it may be, but this was, for me, one of Vonnegut's most enjoyable works of fiction."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"(this review contains no spoilers)CAT'S CRADLE was the first thing by Kurt Vonnegut that I ever read, and honestly, I would probably recommend this novel above all others as the best place to start reading Vonnegut's work. It's relatively short, and chapters are only a page or two long. The book moves at such an incredible pace that it's hard to put it down. Beyond that, the book contains messages and themes that I still think about today (it's been about 5-6 years since I've read it).The crux of the book involves a hopeful author that tries to make sense of the Hiroshima bombing. He stumbles across the story of a mad-scientist involved in the making of the atomic bomb. While searching for information concerning this scientist, he stumbles across the scientist's children and a strange creation only known as \\"Ice-Nine.\\"The essence of Vonnegut's writing concerns the underbelly of humanity: war, greed, anger, stupidity. This book particularly was written in response to the Cold War and the Cuban Missile Crisis. Instead of his books being dark, dreary affairs, they are actually pretty funny and full of wit. Vonnegut's philosophy is that, when faced with something horrible, you can cry or laugh; he prefers to laugh, as it involves less tears. Laughing at these truths are the only things that stop us from crying. Much of the plot of CAT'S CRADLE would, in any other context, be pretty disturbing, but given the author's knack for humor and pacing, it becomes a satirical farce.Kurt Vonnegut is often considered to be a science-fiction author (probably due to the alien presence inSLAUGHTERHOUSE-FIVE), but CAT'S CRADLE is largely devoid of any kind of scientific-mumbo-jumbo. Sometimes this novel is dinged for its flat characters, but as long as readers keep in mind that these are less of characters and more of symbolic representations of humanity's various faces, this probably won't be an issue.I would recommend CAT'S CRADLE to most people I know. In fact, I would recommend it to anyone interested in the plot's premise, but I would especially suggest this novel to anyone who is looking for a good gateway to begin reading Kurt Vonnegut. CAT'S CRADLE or SLAUGHTERHOUSE-FIVE are both good places to start, but due to CAT'S CRADLE's more brief nature and absurd themes, I'd recommend it first."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Kurt Vonnegut is probably the epitome of insane. And I mean that in the best of ways. Vonnegut's use of prose weaves the zany, the quirky, the tragic, and the realistic all into one beautiful quilt, a pattern of images that sticks with you forever.Cat's Cradle was the first novel I ever read by Kurt Vonnegut, but it has encouraged me to continue through his work.The plot concerns itself with Jonah, our loyal narrator who is researching the family of Dr. Felix Hoenikker, and his connection to the development of the atomic bomb. Through this link, Jonah, and the reader, is introduced to his children, who are all unique in their own way. Saying anymore than this might spoil the story, which is very interesting.Vonnegut's prose is very frank and efficient. This does not necesarily mean it's austere, however. Often time Vonnegut uses metaphors or seemingly unrelated topics/imagery to convey his ideas and/or theme. The end product is fantastic.This book is fit for almost anyone. If you are here, reading this review, thinking about reading this book, then it has already piqued your interests. Read on! And read quick!The First time I read this novel was in 8th Grade. I thought I understood it then. I was very wrong. I have since returned to it, even if just for a few pages of light perusal. This has remained one of the best books I've ever read. I urge you to try it out!"},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Since I was a child, this book has been dear to me. It taught me morals and values that I still hold close today. But what morals would that be? It certainly didn't teach me to think that all new military technology is evil, that religion is all lies, or even that all \\"midgets are, after all, diversions for silly or quiet times.\\"I love this book because it reminds us that one of humanity's greatest gifts is an ability to create new things out of nothing, and at the same time it warns us that unbridled arrogance in this creation - lying, approximating, assuming we can predict everything - is a danger which should always be kept in the back of our minds.Vonnegut disapproved of the atom bomb and all of the new, despicable, creative technologies that Cold War scientists were developing. MADD made him mad because he believed the theory was quite mad in itself. I don't share these beliefs, but I certainly agree that worrying about nuclear destruction, chemical weapons, and biological agents is vital to the health of the modern world. Worrying about these things is what makes us human; it is what keeps the world sane in the advent of nuclear weapons. Vonnegut's book definitely taught me to be wary of consequences, averse to arrogance, and suspicious of others' creations. These things are in the back of the minds of any one who has read this book and as these people create for themselves, this story's morals will stick with them. That is the brilliance of this book. I think it has served its purpose."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Wow! What an amazing piece of writing. If you've read my previous two Vonnegut reviews for The Sirens of Titan and Slaughterhouse Five you'll know that I was not impressed with Mr. Vonnegut after my first read and he slowly grew on me with Slaughterhouse. I enjoyed S5 and Cat's Cradle may have just become my favorite book of all time (for now). After my first two Vonnegut novels I found myself with a pretty decent understanding of Vonneguts writing style and it seems to grow on me more with each.What I liked most about Cat's Cradle is that it can be whatever you're looking for in a book.It certainly holds it's own if you're looking for pure entertainment.Vonnegut's wit and the story shine through here by themselves. I never felt like I had to search for greater meaning to the words in order to appreciate them.As an example there is an exchange between Miss Francine Pefko and Dr. Asa Breed early on in the novel that I found so hilarious I reread it about 8 times.Another that stands out in my mind is the chapter titled \\"Bicycles For Afghanistan\\" in which H. Lowe Crosby describes the current state of the American Bicycle industry.It just goes to show how politics can screw up the simplest of business models and although written in 1963, could very well have been penned yesterday.That being said, it would be hard for anyone with an average intelligence not to pick up what Vonnegut was trying to get across with Cat's Cradle.This is a wonderful book that has serious, yet comical, political,anthropological and religious messages.It's not hard to see why Vonnegut was awarded his M.A. for Cat's Cradle from the University of Chicago in the abscence of a formal thesis.I recommend this book to just about anyone.It's very clear why Cat's Cradle is cemented into literary history as one of the all-time greats."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Cat's cradle has the unique prose of Vonnegut. I'm talking about the perfect blend of humor, irony and truth that can summarize the most trascendental aspects of our existence. In this book - which to some people is the best of Vonnegut's novels- religion, science and politics converge in the stories of an imaginary inventor of the atomic bomb, a sustance capable of freezing the planet, a prophet, a banana republic and many other characters that reflect the contradictions of modern society. With memorable passages and new words of the \\"bookonist\\" faith, this book will undoubtedly leave a footprint in every reader."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"This author made me fall in love with literature. His wit and dark humor brought to science fiction what Carlos Santana brought to rock and roll: A unique quality that created a new form. I love pretty much everything Vonnegut wrote, but Cats Cradle will always remain for me one of his most impressive accomplishments."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Vonegut's most excellently crafted novel. So light and easy to read - so heavy in imagery and message! It's fun and funny but dwells on the pointlessness of material wealth, religion, government, yes ... and love!!! A new religion in a banana republic, a scatterbrained scientist with a weird family, the world's most beautiful woman and some deadly science all mix together to make a ripping yarn. Busy Busy Busy ... I've read it a dozen times over the years and I'm still hooked and still a devout Bokononist. Thanks Kurt.Cat's Cradle: A Novel"},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I just finished up this novel and wanted to add my two cents to the hundreds of other reviews. This is a very interesting and well written novel by one of my favorite authors. I won't spoil anything, but expect more of Vonnegut's wry and dark wit. The entire novel though is poking at religion, so if you are very religious and don't have a sense of humor when it comes to people poking fun at religion, then you may want to read something else..."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I read all of Vonneguts books in high school, 35 years ago. A few years ago I picked up one of his books and found it kind of dated. Then on a whim I reread Cat's Cradle. It is so Vonnegut. For fans, that is probably enough description. He presents his view of the human condition in a way that will make you like the characters, most of whom are bumblers. He does present strong views, but never in a way that make you feel preached at, but in a way that leaves you laughing at first, and then rechewing the ideas later. This book is definately not dated, and now I am in love with the author all over again. I am thinking he is an author that should be required high school reading, a lot more entertaining than being forced to read Beowulf!"},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I became an instant fan of Vonnegut when I read this book. This is certainly the best of all his novels. His imagination is astounding; not only does he write better science fiction than most &quot;real&quot; science fiction writers, but he also invents a believable new religion (with a whole new vocabulary) and peppers the book with dark comedy so black it makes the movie &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot; look cheerful. This is not a book to read when you're depressed. However, it is the perfect statement of Vonnegut's manic-depressive genius."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"This book is a strange prayer for peace. Written in 1963, at the height of a country in the throes of nuclear paranoia, Russian Fear, Kennedy's assassination and increasing American interest in the land of Vietnam, it is easy to see why Vonnegut felt compelled to write this book.He writes, \\" Perhaps when we remember wars, we should take off our clothes and paint ourselves blue and go on all fours all day long and grunt like pigs. That would surely be more appropriate than noble oratory and shows of flags and well oiled guns.\\"This book is anti-war, anti-religion and anti- science, for it too, in the form of nuclear bombs and \\"Ice-9\\" will destroy the world as we know it.From the books of Bokonon, a satirical send-up of Religious writings treated as the all-knowing word of god:\\" Man blinked. 'What is the purpose of all this?''Everything must have a purpose?' asked god.'Certainly,' said man.'Then I leave it to you to think of one for all this,' said God.And he went away.\\"I would recommend this to anyone who loved Slaughterhouse-Five, for this is how the author arrived at that great story. An evolution of sorts, dealing with the same subject matter.(Sidenote: Ice-Nine is the name The Grateful Dead chose as it's lyrical publishing company name. Obviously this was a book on the shelves of many far-out kids throughout the 1960's. Just thought I'd mention it.)"},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I discovered Vonnegut in high school and fell madly in love. Besides being a wonderful writer, he's a perfect transition point for someone just beginning to tackle literary fiction, because while his style is accessible, his ideas are complex.I've read all of his stuff, and CAT'S CRADLE was always one of my favorites, along with BREAKFAST OF CHAMPIONS and MOTHER NIGHT. But this is the one I've returned to most often, probably three or four times, so the day after he died, I picked it up again as a personal farewell. Like all of his stuff, it's deeply human, mingling a sincere love for our best with a wry acknowledgment of our ever-present worst. Summarizing this book takes the joy out of it, so I'll just say that it's about a new religion, a nuclear scientist, a midget, a failed writer, and the end of the world. If you've never read Vonnegut, you could do worse than to start here."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"\\"Cat's cradle\\" is written in very Vonnegut style, in the midst of fiction and realism. The book starts describing the narrator's intention of writing a book about what important Americans did on the day Hiroshima was bombed with major attention on the \\"father of atomic bomb\\" fictional Nobel laureate physicist Felix Hoenikker. During his research the narrator gets acquainted with the scientist's childern though several letters, and finally ends up in the plane with them flying to an island where Frank Hoenikker suppose to become the next president.Bokononism as a new religion defined by Vonnegut, created in the fictional island of San Lorenzo, one of the poorest countries in the world that was yield by each government to the next without any resistance during last several centuries. None of the islanders cares about anything except fishing, bokonizm and sex (defined as \\"boko-maru\\" in unpublished Bokonist books). All the intrigues are about a powerful material called Ice-9, the last discovery of great scientist, the only existing piece of which was shared among his children.Narrator fells in love with beautiful Mona, who as well as all other native Bokonists make suiside by Bokonon's order. At the end he appears alone with four Americans on San Lorenzo as a \\"new Robinson family\\" and finally meets Bokonon, the creator of Boknist religion. The book leave reader guessing what will happen next and is absurd and fantastic."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"This book is a classic. I read this book during college, and I have proceeded to read it at least 4 more times. The entire story highlights the depth of Vonnegut's genius. It also shows how carried away that man can get with things. The Ice 9, in my opinion, is a metaphor for the nuclear arms race and MAD. The characters are sharp, each with their own duty and importance to the story. I believe that Cat's Cradle is a good as other Vonnegut classics such as Slaughterhouse 5. I would recommend this to anyone that is looking to read something a little different than what they are used to. Vonnegut is a genius, and you need to discover why that is so."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Kurt Vonnegut's \\"Cat's Cradle\\" is the story of a man, Jonah, who is writing about the \\"end of the world,\\" or the day when the atom bomb was dropped. His work on the book encourages him to go on many journeys which ultimately leave him in a somewhat ironic yet very comedic position. The story features an imaginative religion, a scientific potion, and a far off society as part of Vonnegut's many bizarre episodes. Jonah, researches the \\"father of the atom bomb\\" and his children in order to determine what they were doing on the day the atom bomb was dropped. Seemingly against his will, Jonah gets pulled into a plethora of discoveries about the children and their father which he never could have imagined to be true. His journeys ultimately land him, along with the children, on a secluded island with a radically different society from their own.I did in fact enjoy reading this book because of the absurdity and the unbelievable voyages which the main character undergoes. However, it is in fact Vonnegut's style that makes the book so enjoyable. He is able to bring the reader into this world where virtually anything can happen which then leaves the reader totally unaware and clueless as to what comes next. The world allows him to describe such things as the discovery of the island of San Lorenzo in a two page account where six different countries claim and forget about the nation before escaping African slaves finally claims the land for good. It is through Vonnegut's voice and style that the reader may not stop to consider such oddities as this one.Originally, I chose to read this book after finishing Vonnegut's \\"Slaughterhouse Five,\\" and was absolutely taken away by the combination of absurdity and hilariousness through which he expresses himself in this book. Though I did not expect this book to be as far out as the alien adventure in \\"Slaughterhouse Five,\\" it did seem like a pleasant offbeat satire about modern man. In the end I enjoyed this book more than \\"Slaughterhouse Five\\" because of the comedic voice that I found more visible in \\"Cat's Cradle.\\" Though the first was rather ridiculous and interesting, for me it did nothing more than provoke thoughts about where such an idea would come from, rather than make me laugh.I would recommend this book to anyone who is seeking an imaginative and far off satirical story that is sure to create a smile. While many may think the story to be boring and pointless, it is partly this hollowness that makes it so enjoyable. The reader is baffled and unable to understand why things happen the way they do creating a randomness that I have found to be attractive. For those readers that were bored by part of the book and decided to put it down forever, I would encourage you to fight through the beginning. After all, I did in fact at first believe that this would be a serious account of the day the atom bomb was dropped, until the Bokonon religion was further explained and glorified."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Let Vonnegut plunge you into the dark realm of scientific progress. Meet Felix Hoenikker, a scientist who cares little for the consequences of his breakthrough research on humanity. Discover how his creation, ice-nine, affects those around him. Imagine the impact of merely a single drop of ice-nine that can cause oceans of water molecules to freeze irreversibly.Through Vonnegut's often aberrant and whimsical text, he manages to depict humankind's search for happiness, while using humor, wit, and cynicism to explore morality, the absurd, religion and mortality. This is a story about creativity and the power of science; and at the same time it is a pessimistic look at the fate of humankind, a stupid and vicious race.You will adore Vonnegut's catchy chapter titles and quirky characters, but may grapple with trying to relate seemingly disconnected chapters. References to oblivion and abyss emphasize the idea of emptiness and remind us that we are all wanderers, with regrets and lost questions, clinging to our souls."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"This book was amazing. I read Slaughterhouse-5 and Bluebeard before reading this book and this is my favourite of the three. He's a genius. You have to read it."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"\\"Cat's Cradle\\" is another brilliant novel by Kurt Vonnegut. A science fiction satire/tragedy/love story/dysfunctional family saga, \\"Cradle\\" is narrated by a writer who had set out to write a book about the day the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, Japan. Ultimately he gets involved with the colorfully warped family of scientist Dr. Felix Hoenikker, a weapons technology researcher. The narrator's quest takes him to the Caribbean island republic of San Lorenzo and to an encounter with Bokononism, the remarkable religion that has been outlawed on San Lorenzo. And driving much of the story is the secret of Ice-Nine, a scientific discovery with horrific destructive power.Above is the bare-bones outline for a richly-peopled, tremendously imaginative exploration of human arrogance and frailty. \\"Cradle\\" is filled with brilliant motifs and details. From the San Lorenzan dialect to the details of Hoenikker family history, the book is a wonder. But possibly the best part of the book is Vonnegut's rich realization of Bokononism: its scriptures, rituals, and lexicon are intriguingly revealed throughout the book.\\"Cradle\\" is full of unforgettable scenes of both horror and whimsy, all brilliantly capture by Vonnegut's amazing prose. For a compelling companion text, try Octavia Butler's \\"Parable of the Sower,\\" another sci-fi novel about a fictional religion."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"\\"Cat's Cradle\\" is a heavy-handed satire about the military-industrial complex using brilliant scientific minds to create weapons of mass destruction, but because it's written by the inimitable Kurt Vonnegut, you get a cleverly conceived tale of science fiction delivered with the comical madness of a Marx Brothers movie. This novel is pure fun even at its apocalyptic extreme.The narrator (\\"Jonah,\\" as in trapped in the belly of a whale) is a journalist who plans to write a book about August 6, 1945, the day the first atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima. Particularly he is interested in the life of the late Dr. Felix Hoenikker, one of the principal scientists who worked on the bomb. After corresponding with Hoenikker's midget son Newt, he interviews fellow scientists at Hoenikker's place of employment, a think tank called the General Forge and Foundry Company. Jonah learns that one of the last things Hoenikker was working on was something called \\"ice-nine,\\" a substance which freezes water at temperatures much higher than 32F.Then Jonah gets an assignment to interview a philanthropist named Julian Castle who runs a charity hospital on a Caribbean island called San Lorenzo. On the plane to San Lorenzo, Jonah happens to meet Newt and his horse-faced sister Angela who are on their way to the same destination to attend the wedding of their brother Frank, who happens to be a high-ranking official on the island, to a beautiful native girl named Mona, the adopted daughter of \\"Papa\\" Monzano, the island's dictator.Arriving at San Lorenzo, Jonah finds out that all the islanders practice an outlawed religion called Bokononism, started by a calypso singer named Bokonon. Bokononism is in a constant state of development as its founder thinks of new things to write about, but its main attribute seems to be a sort of shoulder-shrugging fatalism supported by well-meaning but useless aphorisms, a playful lexicon, and a bizarre foot ritual. Frank offers Jonah the Presidency of San Lorenzo upon Monzano's imminent death, simply because no one else wants the job. Unfortunately, a few stray samples of ice-nine and an ill-fated air show spell disaster for not only Jonah's lucrative new position, but the world.Note the modern implications of what the defense industry today calls \\"technology transfer\\" -- sure, ice-nine kills every living thing that touches it, but it has practical uses like solidifying muddy roads for military operations. As Vonnegut feels that writers are society's canaries in a coal mine, this novel is like a big red flashing warning signal to the powers that be, not that they'd heed it, and besides, it's too late already. What else is there to do but laugh?"},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"End-of-the-world fiction is probably my favorite fiction genre, and I found Vonnegut's &quot;Cat's Cradle&quot; to be by far the most bizzare addition to my library in this area. My interpretation is that it is suppose to be taken in the same vein as Stanley Kubrick's black comedy film &quot;Dr. Strangeglove.&quot; Not only was it written around the same time at the height of the Cold War, it has the same high farce tone about it. Vonnegut's ultimate fate for the world is sheer genius, though when it finally happens, it seems almost like an afterthought. Vonnegut's book is a challenging read and one that is not for everybody. Nevertheless, you'll find yourself thinking about it long after you've put it down."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Absolutely one of the most necessary reads of a lifetime!

I found myself smiling openly as I turned each page, not necessarily because it was funny, but because it was that good. You don't see anything coming, but when it does, it somehow makes all the sense in the world. To say that this book is simply an apocalyptic novel is to sell it short. It contains within it snippets of dialogue and random encounters with quirky individuals that we've all experienced at one time in our lives. Although only a very short novel, it's as dense as they come. Every sentence has its own significance, every chapter is a story in itself. I never thought that such zany and zealous prose could manage to create such a structurally sound story. You'll probably finish it in one sitting, and you'll be angry that it's over."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I picked up this book because I hadn't read Vonnegut since high school. The best way I can think of to describe reading this is to compare it to train-hopping, destination unknown.

By the end, you're flipping the pages faster and faster trying to figure out where you're going to land."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Cat's Cradle is the first Vonnegut novel I have ever read and still my favorite novel of all time. Never before have I read an author that is so dark, fatalistic and twisted, yet funny and optimistic at the same time. Vonnegut writes like nobody else. &quot;Cat's Cradle&quot; makes you think. It makes you laugh at notions you normally wouldn't. Vonnegut's very &quot;matter of fact&quot; style of writing is genius. I'm sorry but, If anyone tells you that this book is no good its because they're just not intelligent enough to appreciate it.! I have read ALL of his works and I always eagerly await his next."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"One of Vonnegut's best works. He truly makes you think! It's based upon a substance called Ice-9 powerful enough to freeze over the entire world at room temperature. It provides us with a man's thought of how the world will end, and gives us a look at the future, that some would find very believable, while others would find it very entertaining. It is definitely the type of book that you must follow from the beginning, and think things through at times, but overall a great book. Most Students, whether in High School or Collage, if you ask them have probably read the book. Definitely a peoples choice!"},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I do not, by any means, consider myself a literary critic, but I do know what I like. Cat's Cradle led me to Kurt Vonnegut, and I find no other author that can stimulate such thoughts. He introduces his audience to old ideas with a new way of interpretting them. I would recommend Kurt Vonnegut to anyone mature and intelligent enough to respect his humor and creativity. To this day, I &quot;live by the foma.&quot;"},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"This book was great! Totally different than anything i had read before, but it kept me interested."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"It was my first experience with Vonnegut. It was great. Not so hard and not so easy. He basically satires religion and science. Religion is nothing but lies, and science is truth. But even though science is based on proof, so it seems right to us,some bad sciencists don't care about the rest of us. There are two type of scientist--good guys and bad guys. Good scientists are doing their work for human beings just like the way Castle does his jobs. Bad scientists have no moral sense what they are doing. It seems to me he doesn't like religion and science at all.However, he still gives us a good path that science need to follow -- Take care of people rather than kill them. Religion is nothing but lies. But we need religion because we need to lean on that whenever we encounter problems. He also gives us an example of that when papa is dying he does boko-maru which is bokononism ! ritual to feel comfortable. Anyway, this book is great and make think a lot about two basic elements of our life.P.S.-His background would help to understand this book. He majored chemisty at Cornell, and later he attended U. of chicago to study antropology. So he has a balanced background of science and religion."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"This book is a great read! It was classic Vonnegut satire.

Anyone who questions religion (from my point of view the main focus of the book)will find solace and understanding in these pages, while at the same time attain a good perspective into those who are religious. The humor is wickedly true (my favorite being the culmination of a father's love to a young midget: a string game of the book's title with &quot;no damn cat, no damn cradle&quot;).

This and &quot;Slaughterhouse Five&quot; are two of the best books that I've read in a long long time. Vonnegut's fertile imagination and his totally original way of presenting his stories, along with meaningful and witty and thought provoking content really elevates him to a pedestal few authors have had the honor of climbing. I loved the idea of Bokononism, and strangely, found myself agreeing with most of 'the fomas' that Bokonon sang! One realizes how narrow and petty the human race has become, with all its greed and 'granfalloonism', and if freedom from that necessitates listening to a pack of lies, so be it!! Good work, Mr. Vonnegut. I recommend this book to anyone, whether you just want a hearty laugh or whether you want to partake a spiritual journey. Read it ASAP!!"},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I loved this book! The humor, the writing, the philosophical ideas, the characters, everything.

It is light and entertaining while heavily examinatory of modern society. The ending is complete and utter genius.This book will give you a taste of what Vonnegut is all about."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Cat's Cradle is the story of a reporter chasing down the family and friends of a one of the \\"fathers\\" of the nuclear bomb. The story takes him to a impoverished remote island that has developed its own religion that everyone practices but no one admits to.Vonnegut has a hilarious narrative style as always and goes into the fantastic and absurd by the last half of the novel. I would recommend this book for anyone looking for a quick read (especially on an airplane, since some of the best parts take place in the friendly skies). Though it isn't his best, Vonnegut doesn't provide the social commentary that something likeGod Bless You, Mr. Rosewater."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"The reason I chose Cat's Cradle by Kurt Vonnegut is because my friend Matt Burke recommended it to me. The protagonist of the story is John and he wishes to investigate how the day the atom bomb was dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki was in the house of its inventor, Felix Hoenikker. He intends to write a book on the topic. He writes a letter to Newt, the youngest son of Felix, and with that as a starting point, he becomes even more intrigued by the issue. He decides to travel to Illium, where Felix worked, to investigate his workplace and speak with former co-workers. After visiting Illium he determines that the best way for him to get the most accurate information is to speak with Felix's other children. He tracks down Felix's oldest son, Frank, on the island of San Lorenzo and coincidentally on the way there he meets Angela and Newt (Felix's other two children). San Lorenzo is a poor island ruled by \\"Papa Monzano\\" on a variety of peculiar paradigms. Monzano is very isck and eventually commits suicide with the aid of Felix's last great scientific invention, ice-nice, an isotope of water that can instnatly freeze things. You will have to read the novel to be able to find out the thrilling twist with which it ends.Cat's Cradle was an extremely interesting novel and I am really glad I read it. Through the telling of this somewhat bizzare story Vonnegut is able to convey some social commentary that i found to be both interesting and true. The title was very appropriate becuase it seemed to embody the overarching theme of the novel, whcih was that oftentimes humans see things and make things that simply aren't true. It seemed as if the book was written with a satiric tone, yet it was not intended to be entirely funny. It highlighted the existance of certain paradoxes that people never take the time to actually think of. For example, we readily dichotomize between good/evil but what really constitutes each? Does the man who created the greatest killing mechanism in history constitute being awarded a Noble Peace Prize? Cat's Cradle invoked critical thought and lead me to explore angles that I otherwise wouldnt have, and thus it was a good choice."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"If you're not a devoted fan of Vonnegut who picks up everything he's read including his short stories, then this is not the one I would suggest. Cat's Cradle is the book that made the world notice Vonnegut, and compared to numerous other authors it's still a great yarn. Compared to his own works, I feel it's not his best.There is still much to be lauded: his engaging prose style, a plethora of imaginative tangents such as a fascinating and hilarious religion. The reason I'd say a book like Slaughterhouse Five is far better is that all the pieces of Cat's Cradle do not fit together perfectly. The book is almost schitzophrenic with hundreds of fascinating tangents, but when one tries to put it together, it's frustrating.I guess that's not the point. The book itself frequently speaks on the meaningless of life, so maybe Vonnegut intentionally made certain of the books tangents lead nowhere. Still, as a reader, one cannot help but wish for a greater cohesiveness. The ending of the book left me highly underwhelmed.Still, this is a very loved book, and for good reason. If I hadn't read eleven other books by Vonnegut I'd be singing it's praises. So, to summarise, I think some of the books he wrote later on in his career are far stronger, but this book is still a worthy read and the first in which hints of Vonnegut's genius are visible."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Vonnegut uses a fast-paced chapter and sentance structure, combined with dark humor to litterily propell you through his works.\\"Cat's Cradle\\" is no exception. His style of writing and the books compelling theme drag the reader from cover to cover in the blink of an eye (no small task for a 287-page book) while delivering a vivid picture of the world contained within those pages.As I said, \\"Cat's Cradle\\" is 287-pages in length and has 127 chapters. Each chapter is barely more then 2-3 pages in length, making it quite easy to read this book on a busy schedule. Vonnegut's briskly paced style means you can read a chapter here and there at your leasure and still enjoy the book.On a side note, Vonnegut's short story; &lt;u>\\"Harrison Bergeron\\"&lt;/u> is featured in one of the textbooks for an English class I'm taking at this time. The same story is also avalible in Vonnegut's 1968 short story collection; \\"Welcome to the Monkey House\\".I also highly reccomend Vonnegut's other novel; \\"Slaughterhouse-5, or the Children's Crusade\\", which is, for those who don't already know, a fictional tale based off of Vonnegut's own experiences after having been captured by the Germans and sent to work at an underground slaughterhouse in Dresden durring World War II."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"The theme of Cat's Cradle is simple: Never underestimate the stupidity of the human race. In Vonnegut's book, the destructive juggernaut we call idiocy ultimately leads to the destruction of the world. This is accomplished via ice-nine. Ice-nine is an isotope of water that is solid at room temperature. It is especially dangerous because one crystal could, if dropped into a large body of water, turn all of the water on earth into this undrinkable substance. What's worse is that if ice-nine somehow gets into the mouth of any animal, humans included, their body will solidify like a statue. This substance was created, coincidentally, by the same man who developed the atomic bomb. That man was Felix Hoenikker. One day while vacationing, Felix's three children found him dead. He had apparently put a crystal of ice-nine into his mouth and killed himself. His children then divided up the ice-nine and each carried their piece in a small thermos. Eventually the ice-nine was pawned for money, love, or power. One of Felix's children gave his piece up so he could get a powerful position on a Caribbean island. Another child gave his piece to a midget Russian dancer/spy. After a very interesting series of events, the world was destroyed by ice-nine. Stupidity is what created the substance, and stupidity is what destroyed the world. Vonnegut was obviously very much against the atomic bomb and other weapons designed to maim or kill other humans. So, don't be stupid: Read Cat's Cradle."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Vonnegut is never a disappointment. Plot that keeps one on the edge of her seat. Twists that keep one intrigued."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"This is one of my favorite K. V. stories. It's got just about every element: comedy, drama, suspense, intrigue, blackmail-all laced with the possibility of the end of the world as we know it.

I didn't know what to think of the option and thought I might as well get it on a book I really know and love (I've read this several times) and it really does do something for it, admittedly I read the majority of the book this time, but next time I will probably just have it narrated.

I definitely recommend."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I picked this up because I LOVED Slaughterhouse Five quite a bit. While this book shares a lot of the style, the narration is a little off to me. Vonnegut doesn't write characters who are good or evil and he does a lot of foreshadowing. In this book, it almost seemed like some of the foreshadowing fell a little flat and the people were not as likeable. The book is still a fascinating read, more correctly classified as a Vonnegut but not poorly placed as sci-fi. I enjoyed it, but not as much as I loved some of his other work."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"It's all in there, cold answers and all. Or maybe not.Nine more words have been asked of me on order to submit this review. This should do it."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"A number of cultural institutions are in Kurt Vonnegut's crosshairs as he pens \\"Cat's Cradle,\\" and it's science, religion, and, to a lesser extent, basic social group identifications that come away bruised and beaten. Even the childhood string game of Cat's Cradle is exposed by Vonnegut, which explains the title of the book.The story's main character sets off to write a book detailing the day of the bombing of Hiroshima and how the family of the bomb's maker spent the day the world was introduced to nuclear weaponry. What transpires is a wild ride where religion is mocked (San Lorenzan Bokononism is a seemingly logical religion that is closely followed despite its own admission that it's based solely on lies) and science is displayed as its own world that detaches its inhabitants from real society (Felix Hoenniker, the man behind the bomb, is lost in terms of raising his children and has never heard of \\"sin\\"). As far as Cat's Cradle -- the string game -- goes, Vonnegut uses the expression \\"See the cat? See the cradle?\\" often throughout the book to emphasize the natural human tendency to see things that aren't really there, just as the array of strings in one's hands in no way resemble a cat or a cradle.I'm not a big reader of this type of fiction but I definitely enjoyed this book. For those who enjoy the eternal debate of science vs. religion and the investigation of these powerful institutions, I certainly recommend it."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Like most of Vonnegut's works, \\"Cat's Cradle\\" proves incredibly hard to explain or review. To sum up, if you like books that make you think, keep you on your toes and off balance, and challenge your assumptions about the way things are or should be, you'll like \\"Cat's Cradle.\\"In this book, Vonnegut explores some familiar themes like the interconnectedness of peoples' lives and how, even from distances of time and space, unexpected and seemingly trivial interactions between people can have huge consequences. Vonnegut makes it clear to us all that sometimes matters of huge importance hang on tragically small details.So if you like a book that will challenge you and make you pleasantly uncomfortable (whatever that means), give this one a read. It won't take you long and you'll have experienced the world from an entirely different perspective - not a bad bargain."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"In style and reader engagement \\"Cat's Cradle\\" has held up very well over the last 5 decades. Vonnegut was undoubtedly an original writer with a sharp wit. He manages to constrain the characters (narrator excepted) within the two-dimensional paper dolls expected of satire while running a thread of mystery through each. Even the awkwardly shallow Mrs. Crosby has a line or two that give us pause.Nevertheless, both Vonnegut and the mysterious Caribbean guru of his creation preface their words repeatedly with an explicit warning not to take any of it seriously. This clouds the book's foggy voyage to deep meaning. Typical Vonnegut fans seem to brush aside the self-effacement as sardonically clever when granting high accolades, but accept a paradox when taking his deconstructionist ideas to heart . Does anyone really \\"get\\" Vonnegut's message, or is he inwardly laughing at those gullible enough to ignore it? Does the emperor have no clothes?Someone else's comparison between Bokononism and Scientology struck an agreeable chord. Both are obviously the figment of a modern mind and seek to reorder human psychology across cultural boundaries, alluding only to vague cosmological bases. Of course Hubbard was real and institutionalized, but either belief system could fill a spiritual longing unmet by the weekly grind of the church routine when the clergy loses touch with people or rebellion seeks an outlet. \\"Cat's Cradle\\" might capture the hearts of an audience in that delicate stage of personal growth when one begins to question the beliefs of their parents and community, but hasn't the knowledge or courage to study the more robust and well-established alternatives closely. It is a fine book with amusingly honest observations on the plight of humanity, but I sincerely hope people come to understand that satirical pop philosophy and the serious masterworks of world literature have distinct literary forms and ends."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"This was a totaly entertaining book. I think I first read it 15 years ago and I didn't pick up on the humor. The stuff about religion is great.I thought Breakfast was better, but this is still a great read."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"An apocalyptic satire of some of the institutions most easily satired-government, religion, military. But Vonnegut is wholly original, as always. His satire holds up today, and there is nothing expected about this book, which involves, among other things: the midget offspring of one of the inventors of the atomic bomb, a form of dangerous ice with the power to freeze people, a tropical island with natives exploited by Americans, and a made-up religion that is just weird enough to be believable. My only criticism, if any, is that although I found the characters interesting, hilarious at times, I wasn't emotionally attached to any of them. I didn't enjoy it as much as Vonnegut's Breakfast of Champions, but it was a good read nonetheless."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I speak such powerful words of the author in the title above because I am a tremendously devoted fan of his. His thought process and ability to write such imaginative and complex fiction baffles me.In Cat's Cradle, the main character named Jonah, begins to write a book aptly titled The Day The World Ended. He begins researching the book, and as he travels on his journey to complete the book (or perhaps to find answers to himself or life), he becomes a convert to a thought-provoking religion that proudly proclames its falsity and was written entirely by a calypso singer. He also expericences love, death, the drawback to power, and the erradication of mankind by a small substance known as Ice-9.I reccommend that everybody read this novel! It may just change your perspective on things!"},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I first read this book in Jr. High, and have read it several times since. It has been one of the most influencial books in my life. It's a great read, fascinating in many respects, and blends politics and religion, which makes it still as relevant today, if nor more so."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Vonnegut's Cat's Cradle (I'm still trying to figure out why he chose that title instead of \\"Ice 9\\" which would have been more descriptive) is a very interesting book. It opens up multiple avenues for discussion on all manner of topics both social and scientific and would be a fine choice for a discussion book or a book club book.Unlike L. Ron Hubbard's Scientology, Vonnegut's Bokononism, created in this book, never caught on as an actual religion. I would say Vonnegut's religion has much more potential among Christians of weak faith than Scientology, so I'm not sure why it never caught on. Perhaps because Vonnegut didn't set up his own church and start believing his own stories like Hubbard did.Anyway, from the character sketches to the fleshing out of fictional locations, sciences and religions, Vonnegut has a fine eye for detail. He has created a world we recognize and he wields the power to destroy it well."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I know everyone tends to claim that Slaughterhouse-Five is Kurt Vonnegut's pinnacle work. I would suggest, however, that Cat's Cradle is instead his peak, quite possibly the best thing he has written to date. Being a huge Vonnegut fan, I believe there is some truth to this opinion. His main character begins by claiming he is writing his masterpiece, a book entitled &quot;The Day the World Ended,&quot; a story about the atomic bomb being dropped on Japan. Instead, it is a whimsical foreshadowing of events to come and indeed events do unfold.Vonnegut is even rather Tolkien-ish in his writings by creating a new culture along with its own language of sorts, really a dialect of extremely bastardized English. It really proves the intelligence and total command over the language that he possesses. Along with said culture comes a new religion, Bokononism, which emphasizes the pharsical and absurd. After reading the book, you might want to convert to Bokononism yourself! I know I was ready to.Without giving away too much of the plot, let me summarize briefly. What if a scientist, say one who worked on the a-bomb, devised a way to make things different, namely a new way to freeze water? What kind of a man would do that? What could his family possibly be like? How about a midget, a model-builder, and a freakishly tall woman? Now imagine you are a writer trying to track down the mystery behind the man and the stories from his family. Follow then the trail of Jonah, the protaganist, through a wild chase that takes him to the heartland of America all the way to a remote island nation with a large hook as the punishment for any offense. Truly a tale of the mad and the absurd. Vonnegut fans eat this one up. Laugh, wonder, be amazed, and enjoy the tale as told as only the master himself could tell it. Worth every penny and on a personal note one of the few books I still find myself re-reading at regular intervals. I still can't put it down!"},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I just read the entire book a couple of evenings ago. It's a school assignment that's not due to be finished for weeks, but once I started reading I couldn't stop. I suppose that's because there isn't a single facet of this book that isn't at least somewhat intriguing.I'll outline the plot without giving much away:John or Jonah (it doesn't matter, since his name isn't used beyond the first paragraph anyway) is a devout Bokononist (religion founded by a normal guy, based on obvious and plainly admitted lies), writing from some unspecified time, trying to relate the story of his writing of a book about the day the atom bomb was dropped on Hiroshima. He begins by contacting Newton Hoenikker, son of scientist Felix Hoenikker, main creator of the atom bomb. Newt's response offers some insight into who his father was, but the author needs more, so he heads off the the elder Hoenikker's former stomping grounds, a laboratory in Illium, NY. An anecdote told by Felix's main partner about a hypothetical &quot;ice-nine,&quot; which could freeze all water on earth below 115 degrees F, is what really gets the story going.The thread of Bokononism seems to tie the main themes together, and it's this clever satire on religion that I appreciated the most.This book also has a great ending, so you have that to look forward to. This book is brilliant and very accessible, so read it already."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Cat's Cradle was given to me from a box of moldy old paperbacks back in 1987 in the jungle on the Venezuelan-Colombian border near San Antonio del Tachira.

The fun poked at the details of the characters was simplistic, yet genius. I often felt like I misunderstood the novel's overall message with the gibberish terminology & the religious gimmicks, though I understood it well enough. Although I would have loved to see what happened after the end, the conclusion left me in shock. It was however one of the best endings I've ever read in a book. Everything I didn't catch on to at the origin of my experience seemed to connect. Vonnegut's criticism of society & their beliefs is evident. The characterization of some of his characters is somewhat questionable, but suitable for the novel's nature.In terms of plot, the novel narrates a journalist's quest to document what important Americans did the day Hiroshima was bombed, leading to an involvement with the fictional Dr. Hoenikker's controversial children which tangle the narrator into a ridiculous culture that circulates around themes like religious myths, false hope & the possible destruction of the world. The book is an overall fast & simple read definitely worth the time of anyone interested in a society-mocking volume."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I wish I had known it was paperback, but still happy I ordered.

Vonnegut was deeply disturbed by the fire-bombing of Dresden during the second world war (he was there as a POW) and by the atom bombing of Hiroshima/Nagasaki.To him God died in the fireball and the mushroom cloud. What disturbed him even more than the incidents themselves, terrible though they were, was the general apathy which prevailed among so may people at the time and subsequently. This book is therefore a satire on both science gone mad and deep religious belief. Written in his inimitable flippant style, the story is apparently ridiculous but on a deeper level it hits home with the force of a sledgehammer. Short chapters, some of only a few pages,and masterful writing keep the pages turning. To me it is five stars, or six if possible, but if you are a believer in the fundamental goodness of man or of any religious conviction do NOT read Cat's Cradle."},{"Title":"The servile state","review":"In \\"Road to Serfdom\\" economist F.A. Hayek recognized the vision of Hilaire Belloc's 1913 book \\"The Servile State\\". Writing during World War II, Hayek said: \\"Even much more recent warnings [about Socialism] which have proved dreadfully true have been almost entirely forgotten. It is not yet thirty years since Hilaire Belloc, in a book which explains more of what has happened since in Germany than most works written after the event, explained that \`the effects of Socialist doctrine on Capitalist society is to produce a third thing different from either of its two begetters - to wit, the Servile State.\\"In short, Belloc said, you get the worst of both worlds, a master class (monopolist Capitalists) using the power of government (Socialism) to control workers. There is name for the condition where one group of people uses the force of law to control the work another group of people; it is called \\"slavery\\".He wrote this in a much different era and it takes some effort to put aside some of the things we take for granted. Belloc saw things like worker's compensation laws as baby steps toward slavery. They tended to create in the law two classes of people, employers (read \\"Masters\\") and workers (read \\"serfs\\"). It divided \\"us\\" into \\"us and them\\".\\"Servile State\\" goes full circle, beginning with slavery in the Roman Empire. The slaves had a degree a freedom and could save up money to free themselves, but they were still slaves. Under Christianity the slave became a peasant with rights of inheritance. Christianity introduced a rough egalitarianism (\\"And because you are sons, God has sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts crying, \`Abba, Father.' So that he is no longer a slave, but a son; and if a son, an heir through God.\\" - Galatians 4:6-7.) and the breakdown of the empire encouraged rights by tradition (A farmer might say, \\"Well, we get to keep 2/3 of everything we grow because it's always been that way.\\"). Belloc argues that rights were increasing throughout the Dark Ages. His view of the time may be a bit rosy, but recent scholarship has tended to lighten up that Darkness and vindicate Belloc's reading.Then came the Renaissance and Reformation. The aristocracy began taking commonly held peasant lands. In England the aristocracy used these lands to graze sheep in order to sell the wool. Thomas More, a fierce defender of traditional rights, lamented this at the time in \\"Utopia\\": \\"\`Your sheep,' I said. \`Once they were gentle and ate little, but now I hear that they have become so greedy and wild that they are devouring the human population.\\" Calvinism's theory of predestination would come along to justify this redistribution of wealth. The rich were rich because they were also the Elect. The newly impoverished peasants were poor because they were the damned. That the \\"ignorant peasants\\" tended also to cling to the Old Religion of Catholicism only reinforced this view. The aristocracy took the opportunity to extend their land monopoly by confiscating Church lands as Christendom crumbled.From there on, according to Belloc, things tended to go downhill, at least in Europe. The State was growing in power and intrusiveness. Pure sweatshop monopoly Capitalism and pure Communism were both bound to fail, Belloc wrote. He said they were too unstable and he was right. Perhaps we would create a society where each person would own enough of the means of production to support himself. Perhaps we could become nations of small farms and family businesses. Belloc called this Distributivism and it owes much to Pope Leo XII's encyclical \\"Rerum Novarum\\" where the pope outlines a just society. Belloc, ever the pessimist, thought this would make a great ideal society, but that people weren't up for it. Instead he thought we would decline into a new thing, the Servile State. Whether it would be the slavery of fascism or the Welfare \\"Nanny\\" State run amok, he didn't say."},{"Title":"The servile state","review":"In this liberty classic, the Catholic intellectual Hilaire Belloc writes that the present system of capitalism is likely to give rise to something new, the servile state, because of inherent instabilities within it. Belloc defines this state as, &quot;That arrangement of society in which so considerable a number of the families and individuals are constrained by positive law to labor for the advantage of other families and individuals as to stamp the whole community with the mark of such labor we call the servile state.&quot; This servile state is a return to the form of pagan slavery that existed in Europe before the advent of Christianity abolished it. Belloc contends that from the original pagan form of slavery, Christianity brought about a new system of society, the distributivist society. In this system, every individual was an owner of property and belonged to guilds which allowed for him to own the means of production. However, the distributivist system failed with the breakdown of the Christian faith. For example, the Reformation allowed for the Crown to confiscate monastic lands. Thus, a small group of indiviudals, the capitalists, came to own the means of production and the property. Belloc does not blame the existence of capitalism on the Industrial Revolution like most other thinkers have. Rather, he sees the problem in society as existing before the Industrial Revolution. Belloc contends that had distributivism not broken down, the Industrial Revolution would have been beneficial to all concerned. The current system of the capitalist state is unstable however, and may give rise to one of two separate things. Reformers have tried to create from the capitalist system a collectivist (or socialist) state. In the collectivist state, private property would be abolished and a group of managers would control all property for the proletariat in trust. Belloc contends that this form of collectivism is likely to give rise to a third thing, the servile state. One way reformers have tried to accomplish this goal is through &quot;buying out&quot; capitalism. Since the state is an older institution than the capitalist owners, it has been considered possible that the state can &quot;buy out&quot; the capitalists. Belloc finds such an idea problematic and shows how this is not possible to occur. Alternatively, the other possibility is for society to return to a distributivist system in which all individuals own property and the means of production. Belloc finds this alternative to be the best, however, he notes that it is unlikely to happen given the current direction in which society is taking and amounts to &quot;swimming upstream&quot;. So, while the socialist alternative works within the capitalist system, it will ultimately lead to servitude. Belloc points out examples of how legislation designed to benefit the proletariat has actually increased the development of the servile state. Examples of this include regulation such as employee compensation and minimum wage laws, which were in the initial stages of being enacted in Belloc's England. The future for freedom looks grim because the proletariat is willing to give up its political freedom in exchange for security and guarantee of subsistence standards. For example, Belloc points out that minimum wage laws actually benefit capitalists because they guarantee that there will not be unruliness among the workers. Also, such laws and regulations involve the creation of a class distinction between proletariat and employer. Given the direction the welfare state has taken contrary to liberty and towards further regulation, these cogent writings of Belloc from near the beginning of this last century serve as an important warning and prophecy for the future. We have indeed headed in the direction of servitude, and Belloc's distributivist ideal seems less and less likely.For an interesting alternative understanding of the modern world and its condition see Julius Evola's _Revolt Against the Modern World_."},{"Title":"The servile state","review":"Hilaire Belloc's 1912 classic represents the former UK Liberal Party parliamentarian's break with capitalism, state socialism and the welter of piecemeal liberal and social democratic reforms that would ultimately evolve into the modern welfare state.The book is simultaneously easy to read and clearly argued, yet sometimes verbose and long winded. Still it's logically argued and conceptually sound.The \`Liberty Press' edition I read included an excellent introduction by American sociologist Robert Nisbet. This extended essay includes personal biographical insights which indicate that \`The Servile State' played an important role in the development of Nisbet's own stream of pluralist conservative thought, a line hitherto neglected by Nisbet's intellectual biographers. Nisbet, following Belloc, champions the role of intermediate institutions, between the citizen and the state, as providing the true institutional skeleton of freedom. Although usually characterized as a conservative, Belloc's Servile State played a critical role in influencing such radical non-conservatives as Dorothy Day and John Anderson, the founder of the Sydney left libertarian movement. This movement later spawned such prominent Australian international intellectuals as Germaine Greer, Robert Hughes and Clive James. Anderson, I believe, even attributed his rejection of Marxism to Belloc. One can easily imagine Belloc engaged in lively debate over drinks with these now prominent, if somewhat wayward, descendants.Still \`Servile State' is not purely a polemical book. It includes insightful historical analysis of the rise and decline of slavery in the west. It shows just how deep rooted and unpeculiar \\"the peculiar institution\\" has been. And just how poor most of the more popular explanations for it's survival across the centuries have been. The great myth of slavery is that it represented the permanent subjugation of defeated foreign enemies. Although prisoners of war were often enslaved, this source of slaves was statistically trivial. Belloc's explanation has the advantage of explaining the relative \\"success\\" of slavery, both in it's historical longevity and relative absence of social or intellectual critique. Slavery flourished as it provided a means to avoid poverty. The destitute would sell themselves and their descendants to provide for immediate needs. This piece of inconvenient history has actually become even more inconvenient since Belloc's day as the welfare state, and it's corresponding net of taxes, border controls and ID cards, has grown. Has 'democracy' allowed 'the masses' to sell themselves into state slavery on an installment basis?The book touches on Belloc's own explorations of the role of Henry VIII's confiscations of Church property and it's redistribution to court favourites thus founding the great landed fortunes of England. Thus as Belloc notes in other books, establishing a powerful vested interest materially invested in the official anti-catholicism that held sway in the anglo-saxon world virtually for centuries. Belloc sees this act and subsequent actions pushed through by a state dominated by the same interests, for example, the enclosure of the commons, as tilting the development of English capitalism and industrialism against the now landless masses and proletariat. Propertyless masses are simultaneously prey to both the advocates of socialism and victims of economic instability. The servile state, Belloc hypothesizes, is built by these pressures from below and above. The most prominent capitalists have no problem aligning themselves with the state, however interventionist. This insight, offered in 1912, before the great wars and great depression accelerated the growth of big government, is perhaps the book's most accurate prophecy.So has the growth of the modern welfare state proved Belloc's prediction of a new servile state? His prediction fails, although the 20th century did see new slave regimes under totalitarian guise, the liberal democracies did not evolve as far in the direction of forced labour as Belloc and later day followers imagined. But then again the dreams of the original founders and pioneers of welfarism failed too. The original welfare pioneers imagined a society of economic justice and security with the poor and homeless protected by impositions on the rich. They never foresaw a day when middle income earners would often be taxed at rates from 30 to 50% of their income with no apparent shift to egalitarianism. Although state enforced compulsory labour has not emerged (yet), Belloc's imagined servile future with a progressively disempowered mass and a surviving class of super-rich but politically well connected capitalists sometimes seems somewhat closer to modern reality than the vision splendid of the welfare pioneers.Maybe we need to think of Belloc's book as a warning rather than a prophecy."},{"Title":"The servile state","review":"This is probably Belloc's most famous piece of social commentary.Published in 1912, it foretoldthe gradual merger of capitalism and socialism to form whatwe today call the &quot;consumer society.&quot;Belloc traces Westerneconomic development from Roman times. He argues that the Westhad just shed the last vestiges of feudal slavery in favorof an independent yeomanry by the late Middle Ages when theProtestant Reformation of the 16th century turned all this around, and resulted in the polarizationof wealth that has continued to this day. His thesis is that capitalism,left to itself, is inherently unstable and must rely on stateintervention. Ultimately, however, the large corporations benefit from moderate socialism.Themass of working people are reduced to servile wage earningconditions -- achieving basic material comfort, but nomeaningful economic freedom -- being kept in line by the bureaucrats to the benefitof big business."},{"Title":"The servile state","review":"I loved the book. I have been trying to learn about the economic system of distributism for a while, and this book kept coming up as the best starting point. At first, I was skeptical of Mr. Belloc's premise that capitalism degrades into a socialist servile state, but he made the point, and his stuff is very easy to comprehend for us not so smarty pants.My biggest problem with this book was the editing. It seems like someone ran it through a scanner and then ran a spell check on it, which substituted way too many words with the wrong ones. It actually ends up changing the context of some of the sentences, and I had to go back and re-read whole sections because of it.It is about the worst editing job I have ever seen, and i would advise people to NOT buy this edition. I am sure there are other editions out there without this problem, and I would highly recommned buying them."},{"Title":"The servile state","review":"The Servile State is perhaps Belloc's most complete exposition of his theory of the various possible forms of political economy. Belloc argues that Western Civilization was first founded on a servile economy, where a very small group of men owned the land, labor, and the capital necessary for production. Yes, they owned the labor. Hence, the appelation, servile. Belloc then argues that Western Civilization gradually became, from this servile state, a distributive political economy. By this, Belloc meant that ownership was widespread among free men. Belloc argues quite convincingly that this is the natural state of man. And it is certainly the state of Western Civilization when the predominat influence on civilization was the Mystical Body of Christ, His Holy Church. Belloc argues that this state of affairs came to be changed with the Reformation, what he, in other books, has styled the \\"shipwreck of civilization\\". Focusing on England, in particular, Belloc proves that a small, landed aristocracy became overwhelmingly powerful in this \\"rising of the rich against the poor\\" and, later, established the inherently unstable capitalist society.Writing in 1912, Belloc held that the capitalistic society could not endure in its then present form. Looking back, it is how remarkable how prophetic was his vision. He argued that the collectivist form of socialism was, in essence, a chimera. Further, he set forth that the decayed capitalist state would ultimatley revert to a servile status.As we look about us in 2008, it is truly striking how many of the features of the servile state are upon us. One factor that Belloc did not emphacize so much, but that is also dispositive of our current situation is the crushing impact of debt. Acknowledging that point, we can say that Belloc's book is remarkably prophetic, beautifully written, as are all of his works, and still tremendously important. Pick up this important little book. Give it a good and thoughtful read. And be richly blessed by the experience."},{"Title":"The servile state","review":"Belloc, a social and economic conservative, takes a sledgehammer to our assumptions about capitalism. It can be unsettling at first, but-- once it sinks in--very revealing. I haven't looked at the world the same way since. I now know we live in a corporate state where big government and corporate business are symbiotic. Belloc's apologies for the Catholic church are a bit forced, but he makes a strong case for some sort of societal counterweight to corporate enterprise. You should balance your reading of Belloc with Daniel Bell's &quot;The Cultural Contradictions of Capitalism.&quot; Then you'll realize that the existing arragement is neither great nor horrid. But, if it's to be much better we'll have to start questioning some of our basic and terribly misguided assumptions."},{"Title":"The servile state","review":"Belloc's account of The Servile State,the condition in which society is characterised by a majority of dispossessed proletarians without the means of production who are faced with the choice to work for the benefit of the minority (an oligarchy of those who do possess the means of production) or starve has only one omission - it does not (nor does it intend to) provide a remedy.For Belloc, servility is the way things have been throughout much of human civilisation. He looks to Rome for the roots of the particular sevile nature of social and economic life in England - which then spread to infect other nations. The arrangement between the owners of the villas and their slaves evolved over the centuries until Belloc's ideal is to be found in the latter part of the middle ages with their cooperative system of guilds, small holdings, common land and dues to the wealthy landowners. The key for Belloc is private property and possession of the means of production. A serf might well have to work certain hours for the lord but he was also free to produce for himself and to improve his own situation. The guilds etc protected against monopolies and the means of production remained widely distributed.Refuting the usual argument that dispossession followed on the heels of the industrial revolution, Belloc cites the start of the slide into a new state of servility as the Dissolution of the Monasteries by Henry VIII. During this period the Crown confiscated the lands of the monasteries - approximately 1/5th of the productive land of England. Henry lacked the power to retain all this land which found its way into the hands of a number of wealthy families - some of whom grew to rival the King in terms of wealth and influence. The power of the monarchy was reduced - over time - to that of a puppet of Parliament, which was largely in the hands of the new plutocracy.When the inventions of the Industrial Revolution arose there was a need for capital in order to commence these great experients. The only source of that capital, following the decline of the cooperatives and the disenfanchisement of the masses, was the rich property owners. The proletariat were utterly at the mercy of the capitalists. As is the way with capitalist systems, the rich minority grew richer as the poor majoirity grew poorer.Belloc's book remains relevant today - indeed it is essential reading for the masses are often utterly ignorant of the state of affairs, believing having had the terms of their education set by the powers-that-be, and lacking the reasoning to question what they are told by their informers). Many (of the servile) would deny their state of servility as they have been hoodwinked. Freedom, for us, is the freedom of licentiousness, the freedom to spend, and therefore the freedom to perpetuate the system and our own servility.Communisms great failing was to confiscate the means of production from the rich and to entrust them to the state. Belloc's ideal is to spread the means of production, to grant to each family the right to private ownership and the means of producing food and enough goods not only to maintain life but to increase personal wealth but without the limitless greed of the capitalist. Belloc would have liked the medieval system of cooperatives to have met with the developments of the Industrial Revolution to the benefit of the majority. The vision is compelling, but the problem is how to get there. The powerful rich are not going to let go of their monopoly, the dispossessed are also disunited and deprived of the education to challenge the status quo, and the violent confiscations of the Communists led only to their own evils.Belloc's prose is impeccable; the book eminently accessible and a pleasure to read. It is high time his other great works were brought back into popularity - The Four Men, The Path to Rome, his histories, poetry and essays. This prolific and original writer deserves to be more widely read in the current age."},{"Title":"The servile state","review":"Belloc is one of a lost breed of free thinking individuals to whom power was to be challenged and truth to be laid bare,for all to see and judge in the open light. The Servile State ,written almost 100 years ago,remains the greatest critique of the capitalistic system in print. The talking points of the free marketers and communists can not hold water to actual facts,logic and historical truth,all having the bottom ripped out from underneath them leaving mere indoctrinated ditto heads repeating what they heard on cable TV.The Servile State is a economics book that does something very interesting...something neither Marx,nor Von Mises or other Capitalist propagandists can do: Belloc proves how his ideal economic form ,Distributism, not only CAN work but DID work in history. The Servile State is the state where the masses are forced by law to work for those elite few whom own the means of production.The status of man goes from freedom to subservient slave,a man dispossessed or property himself and unable to drag him self out of the bondage he is in for literally the entire government is designed for the few to dominate over the many. Much of the book is written to prove how once upon a time,man was free to own the means of his own production,the true owner of his business,farm,home,and how the government in England started the path to capitalism by theft,double dealing, and out right conspiracy. The land was bought up or stolen from the people and made into slaves,wage workers with no say in their own life or profession and given to the few barons and lawmakers who had the power and state backing to do what ever they pleased.The start of Capitalism is not the traditional one which colleges teach of.The necessary illusions taught by professors claim that capitalism was born of the industrial revolution,'mass production for the masses' to accommodate man and his wants etc,etc. In fact 'Servile State' shows the entire foundation of the system is one of theft and domination. Belloc explains how Henry 8th stole the Catholic Church lands during the reformation and sold it off to his favoured subjects.The position of the people from this starting point are contrasted with those of modern times whom now only know of Servile Statehood,the concept of individual property ownership,not even a dream but a long ago forgotten ideal remembered by merely a few.Socialism,or communism,is also described by Belloc as not the freedom giving,people powered entity Marx and his advocates claimed,but in fact a process that works along side capitalism to deprive man of his rights to obtain and control property. Socialism confirms the masses in their subservience by having the means of production controlled not by the masses of citizens but by the few politicians who managed to become the State. As G.K. Chesterton pointed out,Communism is the end result of Capitalism: the means of production owned by the very few elite with everyone else their servants. The various schemes of creating a socialist state are discussed and debunked in practical and inevitably prophetic terms. The modern 'liberal' or 'progessive' doctrines are likewise shown to be not liberating,freedom,democracy giving policies but concrete confirmations of the status of rulers and ruled. Minimum wages ,'independent contracts',and various other schemes,legally acknowledges one man to be the elite and the billions of others proletariats.The Servile State can be considered a reading of prophecy by many for the exact things he discussed might,can,and could happen, did and are occurring right now. As stated before Belloc was one of a few voices 'crying out in the wilderness',one of a few last remaining voices of sanity among the howls or the insane. As the small independent owner dries up and shuts his door,as the Multi-national corporations dominate the globe,remaking every city in their image,as millions lose their home not to fire or war ,but the writing of a pen,the evidence is clear: this is a servile WORLD. As Pope Joe Ratzinger pointed out ,every economic decision is a moral decision.The choice to feed the monsters more is a choice not of 'voting with our dollars',but voting of our status...to continue to accept servitude as a natural state or to rebel against socialism and capitalism leaving mankind to be really and truly free."},{"Title":"The servile state","review":"This is one of the most eudite and insightful books ever written on the topic. Shows how the modern mind has become so thoroughly currupted by Calvinism. The topic is still relevant to-day but since the book was written decades ago, current events could not be cited. To get the full effect from the author's thesis the reader has to read Pat Buchanan's &quot;The Great Betrayal.&quot;"},{"Title":"The servile state","review":"Let me preface this review by stating that I had been looking forward to reading this book for a very long time.Now to the review:I am astonished at how prophetic Belloc's insights are. As I was reading the book, I had a hard time believing it was originally published in 1913. His predictions are spot on to the ailments we are currently suffering from at the hands of the state. I found many of his points to be extremely helpful in understanding the socialist and capitalist models and some of their varying forms.Why only three stars?The greatest problem I had with this book is that I found it very cumbersome to read. For great portions of the book I found myself detached from it. As a result, I deliberately spread the reading of it out over several days in case I was suffering from some ailment which cultivated this distraction. Alas, this was not the remedy I needed.Another problem is, as Belloc himself states, \\"it is not the purpose of this book to show how and under what difficulties a condition of well-divided property might be restored and might take the place (even in England) of that capitalism which is now no longer either stable or tolerable.\\" As I was agreeing with his criticisms I kept asking myself: what's the correct response? Maybe it's unfair to see this as a detraction of the book given that the author says it's not part of his purpose in writing it. However, I can't deny that it's something that weighed on my mind while reading.Finally, I should say that I would still recommend this book to others and that I plan to revisit it at a later time with the hopes that I will find it more engaging and, thus, profit from it as much as others have."},{"Title":"The servile state","review":"Hilaire Belloc was a brilliant and prolific author whose writings on virtually every imaginable topic catapulted him into the top ranks of English intellectuals. Despite his enormous body of work, Belloc is not nearly as famous today as his friend and compatriot, G. K. Chesterton. Chesterton wrote some books on economic and social policy, but still left some areas unexplored. Belloc's \\"The Servile State\\" plugs a major gap by explaining the economic history of Britain.To begin with, Greece and Rome were slave states. Large majorities of the population were enslaved, abused, and denied any hope of freedom or dignity. It was only with the arrival of Christianity that slavery disintegrated. Through the Middle Ages the ordinary people gained more and more rights, and eventually Europe had a population of free and self-sufficient men and women.Then came the moment that Belloc views as the turning point: The Protestant Reformation. In England, the seizure of the monasteries ended the advance towards freedom. Millions of peasants were deprived of their land and denied a means to make a living. They migrated to the cities, and were soon exploited by rise of factories and industry. By Belloc's time, 95% of the population owned no property and were wholly dependent on the wealthy and the government.As Belloc wrote this book, socialism was the dominant trend in intellectual life in England. Almost everyone agreed that it was only a few years until the establishment of a socialist paradise. Begging to differ, Belloc predicted that there would be no socialist paradise (right), slavery would be re-established (wrong), and the rich would get richer while the poor remained poor (right).Belloc was not right about everything, but he certainly saw through the rhetoric of the socialists more readily than other men of his time. \\"The Servile State\\" is a model of crystal-clear reasoning and straightforward writing, and it belongs on the bookshelf of anyone who wants to understand history."},{"Title":"The servile state","review":"Although this is undeniably an interesting work, there are many curious aspects to it. For one, it is one of the only works ever written by an advocate of &quot;distributivism.&quot; Belloc expounds a very strange train of thought indeed, but never the less, comes off with many strong points in the process. However, his view of the middle ages is very out of line, as is his perspective on the history of Catholicism and freedom. Regardless, it is still a fascinating work, well worth reading."},{"Title":"The servile state","review":"This was a book that I simply couldn't stop reading, not because it was illuminating. On the contrary, I kept hoping that with the next turn of the page, Melloc would make sense or at the very least say something that wasn't muddled, confused or vague. I got through 200 pages still scratching my head!His outline is this. Unrestrained capitalism is unstable as it puts property in the hands of the few and the many are left propertyless. This instability can only be resolved in three ways: 1)all property becomes collectively owned through the state (socialism), 2)The return of the 'servile state,' where the propertyless few are forced to labor for bare subsistance provided by those that own the property, and 3)distributive state, where property is distributed equally, but each owner has individual property rights thereto. Melloc's theory is that any attempt at socialism will lead to an equally undesirable servile state, leaving the only real option of distributivism.In theory this sounds great and to Melloc's credit, he states his goals right off. He then defines his key terms- something that political scientists should ALWAYS do. It's a good thing he does this, because the definitions he gives are completely WRONG!!!Property, he defines strictly as means of production. Property rights, then, refer only to that with the ability to aide in production. No wonder so many people, as Melloc sees it, are propertyless!! Next he defines capitalism not as a system of contractual economics that recognizes individual property rights (as it's usually defined) but as any situation where the few as opposed to the many, own the means of production. Under any conventional definition that also describes fascism, socialism, and feudalism, but Melloc fails to see the connection (especially with feudalism, which he applauds)!The next big problem is Melloc's black-and-white approach to what does and does not constitute servitude. Early on, he is clear that one is only a slave if either one is absolutely forced to work (for moderate or little return) or was moderately compelled to work for life (again for moderate or little return). Later on in the book though, we notice Melloc's inability to see any middle ground. He groans at minimum wage, and 'pro-labor' quality control measures simply because he assumes that anyone in an employee/employer position must be there by unwilling servitude. There does exist grey area between the upper-crust and the slave.The last major problem is his solution of the 'distributive state' where citizens have private ownership of property. Although Melloc never addresses how, when, how often, and what apportionment will be used, the infeasability of the 'distributive state' is not hard to see. Even if we suppose that property will be distributed equally (having been snatched from the former capitalist owners) there still exist two problems. First, by the act of snatching, you've already violated property rights. If property can be taken without just compensation, than the term is meaningless. Second, this equality of property will only last so long. As some have a natural talent for business (or any other trade, for that matter) some owners will outshine others, and the really adroit ones will gradually put the other owners under. Right back where we started; What then?!So why two stars? Melloc, though politically feeble-brained, is a good writer and if one can keep his definitions straight, his can be rather insightful. His critiques on what would soon be the FDR welfare-state are pretty accurate and in depth. Also, like I said, this book did keep my attention, which for mish-mash like this, is an outstanding feat."},{"Title":"The servile state","review":"The Servile State is Belloc's treatise on Distributivism; however he spends more time refuting the doctrine of capitalism. He does this by taking a historical approach: the book looks at slavery in the Roman Empire, Feudalism in the Middle Ages, and the Industrial Revolution of the Modern Era. With this setup, Belloc goes on to make the startling claim that the laborers in the capitalist system are no different than the slaves in the Roman Empire. He also says the serfs under Feudalism were better off than the factory workers of the early 20th century. Finally, he contends the problems with Capitalism inevitably require the Communist solution. Thus Distributivism cannot be a solution unless the people willfully choose to depart from the path they already upon.These are all contentious claims and Belloc does defend them. Whether he does so persuasively is not so clear, but his book is a must read for those concerned about finding a possible \\"Third Way\\" between Capitalism and Socialism."},{"Title":"The servile state","review":"The central thesis of this book is that Western countries have largely become Servile States.

True freedom consists in the ability to produce, which by nature requires capital or land in addition to political freedom. Consequently, both capital and land are monopolized by a very few owners. The rest are proletarians that must work for their ability to produce on the owner's terms. The proletarians' political freedom does give them the liberty to bargain for their work, but the proletarian is constrained by the uncertainty of sustenance, so the bargain isn't quite an equal one. \\"The vast bulk of so-called \`free' contracts are to-day leonine contracts: arrangements which one man was free to take or to leave, but which the other man was not free to take or to leave, because the second had for his alternative starvation.\\"Belloc acknowledges that the Servile State requires laws upon which the political freedom is also eliminated. Belloc shows how these laws are in place already in the form of welfare and minimum wages. The modern reader is compelled to question the reasoning here, as he sees how such laws as the minimum wage do not bind either the worker or the owner to the extent of slavery. Still, the underlying principle, that the legal framework for the modern Servile State will be abstract and indirect, as opposed to overt, is convincing.Most importantly, this book does not explain how to avoid the Servile State and to return to what Belloc promotes as the only stable form of society, the Distributive State. To redistribute property would go against the principles that the Distributive State relies upon--the ownership of property.

Together with G.K. Chesterton, Belloc advocated a \\"third way\\" between capitalism and socialism, known as Distributism. By present standards, he was a very conservative Catholic, and expressed support for Franco during the Spanish Civil War.\\"The Servile State\\" is Belloc's most famous work. First published in 1913, it has been reprinted several times, often by libertarians. It's unclear why since Belloc, of course, wasn't one.The main thesis in \\"The Servile State\\" can be summarized as follows. Capitalism is by its very nature unstable. It promotes the interests of a tiny minority of property-holders at the expense of the large majority of propertyless proletarians. Capitalism is therefore only a transitional stage in human history. There are only two alternatives to the capitalist state of affairs: distributism, in which everyone becomes a property owner, or the servile state, in which the proletarians are turned into slaves, but in return get their basic needs met by the capitalists. Belloc didn't think revolutionary socialism was an option (the book was written four years before the Russian revolution). As for reform socialism, Belloc believed that it too was utopian, since it's impossible to \\"buy out\\" capitalism. Reform socialism is nevertheless dangerous since it leads, consciously or not, to the establishment of a servile state. Belloc also fears that the workers themselves might accept the servile state: their condition in 1913 was so dismal, that they would readily accept legalized slavery, provided the state compelled the employers to meet their basic needs in terms of clothes, shelter, food, etc.Belloc then analyzes European history. Initially, slavery was accepted everywhere. During the Middle Ages, slavery began to gradually wither away, being replaced by a distributive system of guilds, village communes and feudal obligations. Property rights became more and more diffused. This process came to an abrupt end during the Reformation, especially in England, where Henry VIII confiscated the lands of the church (which owned a substantial portion of all English land) for the benefit of a new class of wealthy, aristocratic landowners, who dispossessed the peasants and artisans. This eventually created the instability and class conflict characteristic of industrial capitalism.Finally, Belloc points to various 20th century legislative measures he believes foreshadow the servile state. Among them are the minimum wage, compulsory arbitration, unemployment benefits, regulations of the right to strike and lockout, and employer liability laws. Belloc also attacks compulsory education. He is somewhat pessimistic about the future prospects. The traditions of widely diffused ownership were near-dead in 1913, while socialist measures seemed more realistic. And socialist policies, as already pointed out, were in Belloc's mind really precursors to the servile state.I can't say \\"The Servile State\\" convinced me. For starters, the book is actually an attack on the incipient Western European welfare state. This is probably what commends the book to libertarians. However, only an extremist could suggest that conditions in post-war Western Europe and Scandinavia are \\"servile\\". The libertarians also tend to forget that Belloc wasn't against a powerful state (something he makes clear in his discussion about Henry VIII). And while Belloc does call for diffusion of property rights, and presumably wants to end welfare as we know it, he nevertheless envisions a system in which the guilds restrict competition, and where some of the land is held in common. Uncharitably put, the author is closer to fascism than to libertarianism!The historical analysis, while not a necessary part of Belloc's thesis, isn't convincing either. In fact, its contradictory. On the one hand, Belloc claims that Christianity had something to do with the gradual dissolution of slavery during the Middle Ages. On the other hand, he admits that the causes were economic and political. Further, he writes that the spread of distributism was spontaneous and unplanned, while the development of capitalism was a conscious conspiracy. He also seems to think that an industrial revolution is possible in a system of small property-owners. In reality, big industry out-competes the artisans and peasants.Belloc's contrast between servile antiquity and the free Middle Ages is unconvincing for other reasons as well. While slavery, for unknown reasons, was indeed abolished in North and Central Europe during the High Middle Ages, it was never abolished in southern Europe, which was equally Christian. Nor was it abolished in the crusader state of the Teutonic Knights, and conditions in Eastern Europe seemed to have remained pretty servile as well. For some reason, Belloc never mentions the later connection between slavery and capitalism either. But slavery wasn't abolished in the United States or the British colonies until the 19th century! Perhaps he can be excused for not predicting the Bolshevik revolution - after all, even Lenin despaired around 1913, sitting exiled in Switzerland.Can something of Belloc's thesis nevertheless be saved? Maybe, but only in a very revised form. Belloc was, of course, right when he pointed out that classical capitalism was unviable and somehow needed to be stabilized. He is also right that this stabilization requires state regulations of the economy. This is one of the points of the welfare state. Even the United States has de facto federal regulations of its economy. Socialism was another attempt to solve the problems of classical capitalism (it ultimately failed). The closest analogy to a *real* servile state in the modern era seems to have been Nazi Germany. Workers from the territories occupied by Germany during the war were indeed turned into slaves, being forced to work for the German capitalists, but, of course, without getting their basic needs met. However, *German* workers certainly got a slice of the Nazi war pie, in return for not rocking the boat. Thus, Nazi Germany both had a class of nominally free but in effect regimented German workers (who were happy), and a class of enslaved workers (who were less so), both working for the German industrialists.Thankfully, this servile state was defeated by the Allies during World War Two, making it a moot solution to the problems of the modern world.\\"The Servile State\\" is interesting and a relatively easy read, but at least this happy slave remains unconvinced by its main thesis..."},{"Title":"The servile state","review":"The central thesis of this book is that Western countries have largely become Servile States. This might come as a shock to the average modern reader. While everyone can relate to the feeling of being a slave in our modern world of big business and government, they would have a difficult time agreeing to the notion that they are slaves by law. After all, the Westerner has the political freedom to choose whether he wants to work or not.As Belloc explains, freedom is made up of more than just political freedom. True freedom consists in the ability to produce, which by nature requires capital or land in addition to political freedom. Consequently, both capital and land are monopolized by a very few owners. The rest are proletarians that must work for their ability to produce on the owner's terms. The proletarians' political freedom does give them the liberty to bargain for their work, but the proletarian is constrained by the uncertainty of sustenance, so the bargain isn't quite an equal one. \\"The vast bulk of so-called \`free' contracts are to-day leonine contracts: arrangements which one man was free to take or to leave, but which the other man was not free to take or to leave, because the second had for his alternative starvation.\\"Belloc acknowledges that the Servile State requires laws upon which the political freedom is also eliminated. Belloc shows how these laws are in place already in the form of welfare and minimum wages. The modern reader is compelled to question the reasoning here, as he sees how such laws as the minimum wage do not bind either the worker or the owner to the extent of slavery. Still, the underlying principle, that the legal framework for the modern Servile State will be abstract and indirect, as opposed to overt, is convincing.Most importantly, this book does not explain how to avoid the Servile State and to return to what Belloc promotes as the only stable form of society, the Distributive State. To redistribute property would go against the principles that the Distributive State relies upon--the ownership of property. In a confined world, the reader is left to wonder if it is possible after all.This should not discourage the potential reader. There is enough insight in this short volume to enlighten even the most ardent capitalist or socialist, and the fresh perspective offered therein is sure to incite more fruitful motives by all."},{"Title":"The servile state","review":"Though I applaud many of the thoughtful reviews herein, many of the commentators are taking the notion of \\"slave\\" too literally and in an American sense. That's a pity because this book (and The Road to Serfdom) are as relevant to America now as they were to England then, as we deafly ignore history and move toward socialism--or worse. Belloc believed that when socialism destroys capitalism it becomes a third state, the servile state. Read the introductory pages here and you'll get the drift: \\"That arrangement of society in which so considerable a number of the families and individuals are constrained by positive law to labor for the advantage of other families and individuals as to stamp the society with the mark of such labor we call the servile state.\\"Does \\"half\\" constitute \\"so considerable a number\\"? In a sense this is what America has become, and it is worsening at an accelerated pace. Already the bottom 48 percent of the population pays zero Federal tax (and usually no state tax except sales tax)and are subsidized in one way or another by the State; so we're on the verge of seeing for the first time what one commentator called a \\"self-interested majority\\" wherein people can vote for the State to confiscate the labor (wealth) of others for distribution to themselves. And yet all but the vastly wealthy MUST work, regardless of how much the State decides to confiscate of one's labor to give to another it considers more worthy. Thus one's labor is no longer a bargaining chip in America. And real property ownership is something of a myth except in remote pockets of Alaska; if you don't believe that, try not paying your property tax for a few years and see how much you really \\"own\\" your property--or for a certified historical example, look up Wickard v. Filburn wherein the Supreme Court ruled that the State could control the amount of wheat a farmer grew for his own consumption on his own land.In sum when the top half the country entirely supports the bottom half of the country, the top half of the country is slave to the bottom and the bottom is slave to the State handout. If not exactly where we are today, the welfare state is perilously close to the servile state."},{"Title":"The servile state","review":"I cannot think of a better description or should i say prediction of modern politics. This book is well worth reading."},{"Title":"The servile state","review":"In our barbaric past, we were free individuals. We had only that which we could find or produce, and defend. As we became more social, those who had much, provided a means of sustenance for those who had little in return for which those who had little provided labor that annually renewed and increased the wealth of those who had much.Over time, there have been many changes. The earliest of these changes were provided by the generosity of the 'haves' to the 'have not'. The Lords or Squires who had within themselves the capacity to require so much of the serfs that the serfs might only barely exist, in some cases, saw fit to accept less and allow the serfs to retain more. This allowed the serfs to rise from serfdom by forming guilds and other forms of cooperative ownership that allowed each of them to prosper more greatly as part of a collective group than they could have hoped to do individually and to attain the capacity to own a means of producing wealth. Over the centuries, this trend has continued in one form or another until reaching the model of capitalism.Capitalism has prospered, but at a cost. That cost has been the loss of stability. This loss of stability has given way to still more changes in the system that now appear to bind it towards a return to a state of servitude. According to the author, this servitude is something that will be accepted by both, the business owners and the workers. In fact, they will cooperatively work toward its implementation. He indicates that among the earliest evidences toward the transition will be minimum wage laws. Not bad for a 1912 publication. He goes on to describe something that I think we find today in so-called \\"Work for Welfare\\" policies.This book is something I have been watching unfold in my lifetime of 61 years. I find the author's comments at the end of the book to be thought-provoking. It's a short, comfortable read. One that I think is well worth the time and energy. It provides yet another framework for understanding some of the more complex economic relationships of our lifetimes."},{"Title":"The servile state","review":"This short and easy-to-read book will bring an entirely new perspective to the discussion on economic theory. I finished this book aware that there is an alternative to the common belief that we live in a \\"two party\\" economic system, whereby you can either be pro-socialism or pro-capitalism.The Servile State, unfortunately, only introduces the topic of the \\"Property state\\" economic system, but does not delve deeply in to it as a concept after displaying that it once existed. I am interested to read more in the future."},{"Title":"Mythe et epopee (Bibliotheque des sciences humaines) (French Edition)","review":"&quot;A more than encyclopedic master&quot; is what Claude Levy-Strauss called Georges Dumezil in his speech in the ceremony of induction in the French Academy. And the description is only slightly exaggerated. This great scholar, rescuer of a lost language (Ubykh) and knower of more than forty, discoverer of a whole vast cultural complex, and capable, when he wanted to, of dabbling at will in Hebraic culture or Quechua language, was something the modern world had almost forgotten: the synthetizing, large-scale research historian, a Gibbon or Mommsen, writing enormous accounts that cover a nearly infinite amount of topics, and certainly not feeling excluded from any aspect of human knowledge. This titanic compilation, MYTHE ET EPOPEE, is an attempt at synthetizing his many and various discoveries; but, while in every other respect a masterpiece (including a prose that belongs among the greatest ever written in French), it fails to find a suitable form to contain discoveries so vast, so multifarious, so different in scope and significance. Therefore each of its three volumes has different structures. The first is a study of threee epic traditions - the Indian MAHABHARATA, the AENEID of Virgil, and the legends of the Narts of the Caucasus - treated as large wholes and encouraged to explain themselves. The second is a group of studies of single if important episodes of Indian epic and what comparison with other Indo-European stories tells us about their origin and meaning. The third looks at various episodes of Roman national legend in the same light. The wayward shape of the whole collection of studies is further reinforced by a generous helping of appendices, whose connection to the central groups of works is sometimes rather loose.This is not even a quibble; it is a symptom of the sheer enormity of the field that Dumezil investigated. He had gone in so many different directions that a coherent summary of his work is neithr desirable nor possible. In every respect, this is a work to treasure. The amount of insights into the origin and significance of stories and other cultural features is literally beyond computation; every page will introduce you to something both new and fascinating. One cannot say that Dumezil was right always and everywhere, but the ultimate value of his work resides both in the immense amount of valuable insights he has had and in his quite unusual ability to engage with his sources, reading texts with a critical insight and empathy rare in every critic. A masterpiece, an indispensable work."},{"Title":"The Heart of the Warrior: Origins and Religious Background of the Samurai System in Feudal Japan","review":"I am presently translating the book into Hungarian so have to go into every detail of it.

The poem left me wondering if she ever really read Baraka's work, or just criticisms of it. Although he is not one of my favorite poets and I don't agree with him on everything, I have great respect for his work as both a poet and a playwright.

If this first effort is any indication of how she will continue to develop as a writer, there are many very good books to come. The only reason for the lack of a fifth star is that I believe Authors get better with time.Ms. Feder also brings a level of credibility to her story that many works of fiction lack. This book revolves around Pharmaceutical Science and is endorsed by the Chairman of this discipline at The University of Connecticut. Too many writers of fiction take such liberties with what is credible when set in contemporary time that their work lacks legitimacy. Research is skipped, and the expeditious glossing of subject matter is what the reader has dumped upon them. Many Authors should have their work transferred to Science Fiction, as the demands for accuracy in the genre are by definition what are congruent to the world the writer creates.The story takes place over 9 days, and this serves to maintain a sense of urgency throughout the book. I remembered an episode of M.A.S.H. when a clock was placed in the bottom right hand corner throughout the episode. A life had a certain number of minutes to be preserved, and the clock raised the level of tension considerably.Ms. Feder had a more difficult task here, and she handles it beautifully. There can be no clock, and the book will be read well before 9 days have past. So the tension is her writing, her dialogue, misdirection, and sleight of hand. Like Michael Dibdin's \\"Aurelio Zen\\" series she maintains the uncertainty until the very end. The last card is not shown until nearly the final page.She does not use clich&eacute;s, people who pop back up after being thought dead, or the 100 other 3rd rate literary devices the bookshelves are packed with. There were other Authors who I was reminded of when reading this book. I choose not to mention them as readers might feel I exaggerate.But I will say this; \\"Side Effect\\" is better than many marquee Author's works. The tale is better than many of the so-called \\"Masters Of This or That\\". This book will be the one you wish you had bought when she earns her place on The Bestseller Lists.And as a bonus she brings two others players into the book that could have been oh so tired. However she handled them deftly. One aspect I felt was a bit over the top, but this story has a little boy you will enjoy, and a Dog that anyone would love to have. I really hope she brings these characters back; she has created some very special personalities."},{"Title":"Side Effect","review":"Just finished reading Side Effect.

The plot twists alone were enough to keep anyone interested, but the detailed information regarding pharmaceuticals and the daily activities at a pharmaceutical company serve to make the novel wholly believable as well -- and what's a thriller without a respectable level of accurate technical information? Though I do not often read thrillers, I was happy to make an exception in this case.On a hopeful side note, maybe they'll make the novel into a movie. I would suggest Rob Morrow (aka Joel Fleischman from &quot;Northern Exposure&quot;) for the role of the protagonist, Grant."},{"Title":"Side Effect","review":"What a great story!

This book is set that the 2 main characters don't know they are aliens or even that they are siblings at the beginning of this book. Then they find each other, but both had always felt they were different from other people. They can use \\"mind-speech\\" to talk. In the end they fiddle with an amulet that sends out a call, and at the end a spaceship appears. The book ends with the 2 aliens assuming they have been rescued, but it doesn't actually tell of the spaceship's inhabitants or its mission.I don't know if the whole series would be as good, or even if it continued. But I think that for young teens and preteens it is a good sci-fi book for light reading. It doesn't dwell on details or explanations, instead it is fixed upon the characters' feelings on their discoveries and events that happen. So it could be a good book to begin an interest in science-fiction/star-travel books and the questions they deal with: like advanced technology versus a primitive society."},{"Title":"GM Chevrolet Mid-Size Cars, 1964-88 (Chilton's Total Car Care Repair Manuals)","review":"The repair manual was vary helpful.

No Sense. Devlin seems to have a fasination with the idea of needing a grasp of information, but he never actually clearly defines it for us. Although he provides multiple examples, that even a kindergarten could understand, they do not contribute to a complete distinct definition. I bring attention to this when he talks about the 'common artifact' believing that while in a conference meeting people should take notes. Sorry but don't we learn that when we are very young. His examples do not help describe his intentions for aquiring a 'new' understanding for information. My intentions for this critique are not to destroy any credibility, but to state my disliking for the book. It seems at times that Devlin himself is unsure, and is beating around the bush. For instance, &quot;So just what is this stuff called information. Whatever it is...&quot; (p.12)Maybe I find it hard to read Devlin because I am a college student and have not read any other works. However, he claims that his insightful comments are 'guides' for the common worker. I have to disagree. I think that he has written this for authority figures in the work force who are trying to gain an expertise on controlling the flow of their information, be it within the company or outside forces. I have to give him some credit for trying though. It is important as human beings to be able to communicate with each other and as we develop we will always be aquiring new information to apply later on. However, I think that we are capable of solving our problems, because you have to be uncertain to be certain."},{"Title":"Infosense: Turning Information Into Knowledge","review":"&quot;Infosense: Turning Information Into Knowledge is a book that has the capability to be used in numerous ways. For an individual, it can provide a definition to information and knowledge. For a group, I can forsee it being an aid in higher success rates during group work. Companies that have problems with information getting lost somewhere between sender and receiver could gain greater understanding of why that occurred.Given that information and knowledge are not the simplest terms to clarify and try to define, I found that by the end of my reading I had gained a true understanding.Devlin, used many different tactics to simplify what could be a very confusing book. When I began, confusion was the 1st stage I reached. It seemed as if the words were almost running in circles. But, as I continued, I saw that Devlin was saying the same general concepts in different ways to enable the reader to better understand. Another strategy Devlin used was to state real life scenarios. These gave the reader something familiar or realistic to compare to. Catch phrases such as &quot;The Grin of The Cheshire Cat&quot; (9) and &quot;In The Knowledge Game, People Beat Computers&quot; (159) intrigue the reader, pushing them to continue on into the next passage. Another positive aspect Devlin used was subtitles. By breaking the chapters apart it made them seem to flow more smoothly. Then by reading a new subtitle, my mind was refreshed and refocused. The last tactic I will discuss was the use of simple diagrams. Not all people can read the words and picture the diagrams. Devlin, obviously aware of this, provided a visual to help guide the reader through certain confusing parts.I cannot personally say that I gained any sizable amount of new knowledge, not that Devlin did not provide any for his readers. He gave a strong and clear definition of information and knowledge. He stated reasons for communication failure between person to person, person to machine, and machine to machine. His arguments on group sizes affecting output were strong and pointed.This book, Infosense, could be a best seller to companies who want to succeed at the above subjects. The information given by Devlin could become useful knowledge for anyone who does not understand the difference between information and knowledge or who may ne having communication problems. I give this book 4 stars because it is not perfect to me but I am aware of its potential to be of great assistance to others."},{"Title":"Infosense: Turning Information Into Knowledge","review":"Such a promising title is turned into such a waste of time. It amazes me that the author of a good book like \\"The Maths Gene\\" could immediately follow it with utter rubbish like this. He seems to have been beguiled by praise and attention.With maths he is on solid ground. With language and information he is drowning."},{"Title":"Infosense: Turning Information Into Knowledge","review":"It's about how to use information more effectively, and translate this into knowledge. It takes an unusual viewpoint - that of the mathematician - and as such tries to define a scientific approach (situation theory) to information and knowledge. For those of you who just want to cut to the chase, you could probably read the last 3rd of the book and still get quite a lot from it. Whilst very thought provoking, it doesn't really offer anything new, though it does provide some helpful ways of conceptualising the issue."},{"Title":"Infosense: Turning Information Into Knowledge","review":"The title of this review is vastly exaggerating. An author withcredentials including PhD in mathematics and a researcher at Stanforddoesn't usually talk nonsense, but I need an expression to voice myfrustration about the book. I have been enjoying many Devlin's moremathematically-oriented books and his MAA column. This book,InfoSense, however, is very different. How would I expect amathematician to write a book about data, information, and knowledge? Iwas looking in vain for clean and concise definitions of these termsin the first few chapters of the book. I almost stopped reading whenI saw the following equation (pp. 14):Information = Data + MeaningI feel the algebra notation is abused. I expect more from anmathematician. In the beginning of the book the author proclaims \\"it[the book] is built on a sound, theoretical investigation ofinformation that this book differs from the majority of businessbooks.\\" Replacing logical arguments with anecdotes, stories, andsuperficial equations and figures doesn't convince me the book isreally different from other business books."},{"Title":"Infosense: Turning Information Into Knowledge","review":"Bravo!!! Keith Devlin should have opened this work with the following line: &quot;When it comes to information, what most of us need most of the time is infosense, not a theory of information.&quot; This work is a comprehensive guide for any technology subservient; fun seeker to system's analyst. In this book, Devlin &quot;outlines the basic science [of technology] and gives some applications to real problems, both in everyday life and in real companies.&quot; This method works extremely well in not only showing we, the consumers and programmers, true life comparisons to our own quaries, but also allowing for any level of computer tech to appreciate and apply tech theory to applications. From catchy chapter titles such as &quot;The Boston Beer Party and Other Tales&quot;, to incorporating everyday instances to help explain complex paradigms, Devlin has successfully mixed systems ingenuity and technological know-how with his own &quot;infosense&quot; making this work one for every personal library."},{"Title":"Infosense: Turning Information Into Knowledge","review":"While leafing through all two hundred and ten pages of Keith Devlin's Infosense: Turning Information into Knowledge, I found myself wondering, \\"what is the main goal of this book?\\" While Devlin clearly intends his literary venture to be a how-to aid for citizens of the business world (a point stated in the preface of the book), I found it to be more confusing than insightful. Devlin sets out to take on these questions among others: What is information? How is information stored? And what is required to turn information into knowledge? (p.2) However, in answering these questions, Devlin departs from explanation and instead relates story upon story, ranging from the greatest airline disaster in history to the economic history of Microsoft. While Devlin does exhibit the ability to pick interesting stories, they never truly explain the subject of his book. When Devlin does attempt to thoroughly explain the answers to the questions raised in his book, he provides multiple answers that confuse the reader. Take for example his opening chapter where Devlin asks, \\"So just what is this stuff called information?\\" (p.12). Devlin proceeds to provide equations such as &quot;Information = Data + Meaning&quot; (p.14), &quot;Information = Representation + Procedure for encoding/decoding&quot; (p.32), and &quot;Information =Representation + Constraint&quot; (p.33). While this jargon may seem clear to an accomplished mathematician like Devlin, the common reader is left hunting for the meaning within all the different answers. Just which equation does Devlin want us to remember from his book? Which one takes priority over the rest? This is not to say that Devlin's book is all \\"bad.\\" He does provide some useful knowledge, including a description of the impact of group sizes on the relation of information in business meetings (p.122). Devlin also includes a foundation for the implementation of information technology in the workplace, particularly in chapter 24. However most of the useful knowledge in the book lacks sufficient evidence, especially his references to situation theory, which he claims has done everything from providing \\"a method for modeling business and manufacturing processes,\\" (p.7) to creating \\"the first realistic and useful analysis of \`common knowledge'\\" (p.6). A fault in Devlin's book is that much of the information provided is already \`common knowledge' in the minds of his readers. Thus, Infosense: Turning Information into Knowledge, serves as a refresher for the common businessman or businesswoman, it fails to break new ground in the study of information."},{"Title":"Infosense: Turning Information Into Knowledge","review":"Whether you are just curious about the information field, a small business owner, or a Fortune 500 executive every reader can learn from Kevin Devlin's book, Infosense, and apply it to their private or business life.

He also clarifies many points by using examples from his business and personal world, which I found quite interesting.I do have a few complaints about the author and the book. I feel that he may have targeted the business community too aggressively in an attempt to appeal to their &quot;buying dollar&quot;. I also found him to be &quot;long winded&quot; and slow paced in sections of the book. When he introduced a new topic or idea he would sometimes allude to it but not fully describe it until several pages later. Everything considered if you are looking for an introductory book about this topic I would encourage you to consider reading Infosense."},{"Title":"Infosense: Turning Information Into Knowledge","review":"For the communications student, this book provides little in the way new ideas, rather, it reaffirms what has already been digested. Realizing that the targeted audience (which I was excluded from) was not the communications student, but corporate executives and &quot;drones,&quot; this book has plenty to offer. Devlin provides antecdotal examples of his situation theory. While he never clearly states, &quot;situation theory is...&quot; He illustrates the contexts that the theory operates in (which is all contexts, including this post). Because there is no science of Information, the theory can not be stated in a sentence, rather, it can only be alluded to in the abstract, and applied to real world situations.While Devlin does overdo the sheer number of examples throughout the book, he provides summaries for those who understand, and wish to skip the examples to get to the point. Devlin offers advice to the corporate player that seems very much like common sense, but judging by the sheer number of examples, is often overlooked. No sense is taken overlooked more than common sense, and &quot;Infosense&quot; is chicken soup for the common sense of the business world."},{"Title":"Infosense: Turning Information Into Knowledge","review":"As a student in the field of Communication I was interested in reading Devlin's INFOSENSE to broaden my knowledge of the study of information, data, and knowledge and how the three are related to each other. Devlin's background as a mathematician results in his explanations of these terms in comparative equation form. He explains the transition of data into information and ultimately the gaining of knowledge through these mathematical concepts. If you are a newcomer to the field, Devlin does a thorough job of teaching tips for a more successful office atmosphere by suggesting ways of gaining information from data and turning that into knowledge. However as a veteran to the concepts of information, I was unimpressed by his lack of theory. In fact, his equations almost limit the possibilities of gaining information. According to communication theory researcher, Stephen W. Littlejohn, in his book THEORIES OF HUMAN COMMUNICATION, communication, as a process is &quot;too complicated to be approached [with set step by step formulas].&quot; In fact reducing information communication to these equations &quot;inevitably fail as circumstances become more complex.&quot; Littlejohn continues that theories are far more crucial at helping to understand the information concept because by understanding the theory of a concept, one can apply that to any situation. Devlin's only attempt at a communication theory is the concept he introduces as &quot;situational theory.&quot; Ultimately this idea is never exactly defined or stated for the reader rather he writes more about definitions and comparisons of the process of information gain. I would only recommend this book to a businessperson interested in learning about the process of gaining knowledge through information rather than actually learning how to improve their success rate of gaining knowledge. As a student in the field this book offers a different approach to the controversial definition of information however in the end fails to reveal any new breakthrough concepts in the study.&gt; &gt;**Littlejohn, Stephen W.

How many times have you heard or read this sentence lately? More times than you can count, but you still don't know what it means? Then you should read Keith Devlin's InfoSense. This book, written by a mathematician for businesspeople, provides a brief but clear explanation. The author argues that it is actually better to say this is the Knowledge Age, as opposed to, let's say, the Iron Age. While in the past, iron was the basis for every human business, now it is knowledge. Devlin says our society is built upon knowledge, and he explains what is the difference and connection between knowledge and information. He explores how communication has changed with the time, and gives real-life examples of miscommunications that had serious consequences. But not only that, in his book, he gives advice on how to avoid such miscommunications. The rules he mentions can be used just as effectively in our everyday life, as in a business situation. These ideas include, for example, that &quot;everything we do occurs in a context, and is influenced by that context&quot; and that &quot;maintaining the common ground is the most important single factor that determines whether a conversation is successful or not.&quot; Devlin also explains the math behind these rules as he mathematically proves that we always tend to discuss familiar issues in a group conversation instead of introducing new ones. For easier understanding of the workings of human interaction, the book includes diagrams and charts. Also, there is a summary after every chapter, which repeats and briefly explains the key concepts discussed in the chapter. Altogether, InfoSense is a useful book for everybody. It should be stressed, however, that it is a serious work, written for a serious audience. Everybody could benefit from reading it, but probably those would value it the most, who already have prior experience in reading similar literature."},{"Title":"Infosense: Turning Information Into Knowledge","review":"As primarily a business-oriented book, Infosense is intended to improve the flow of information, particularly in companies. The initial problem with any book discussing an academic theory is to keep it in terms which the intended audience can understand and use. However, by keeping to 'Dick-and-Jane' simplicity, the clarity of Devlin's overall work suffers.Throughout the first chapter alone, confusion ensues. Devlin attempts give a functional definition for the terms data, information and knowledge but does not ensure the reader's understanding of this. Giving no precise definitions, Devlin leaves the reader to comprehend by oblique means. First, he writes that &quot;Whatever it is, information can be a valuable commodity, to be collected, guarded, duplicated, sold, stolen and sometimes killed for&quot; as he is leading up to an explanation.However, the explanation is quickly derailed by the statement that first we must understand data and then we must understand knowledge, and so on until it is skipped over completely to follow the path of how information flows and solving problems.Devlin often returns to his favorite buzzphrase &quot;Situation Theory&quot; which he has been involved in for more than ten years. Even as he tries to trace most of his assertions back to this wondrous cure-all, one has even less of an understanding of this theory than of information. One more into the oblique, my friend.Since &quot;Infosense&quot; was penned by a mathematician, one might expect a horrid series of equations and scientific methodology (which occur in small, easy to use quantities although not very useful) but instead find unsubstatiated numbers in many of his examples. An early discussion surrounding the effect of the growth of necessary information-processing on productivity in the United States starting in 1950 to today. Data abounds in an attempt to exemplify that we do not as yet know how to utilize information. However, no sources are cited for his data nor is 'productivity' ever defined. A question which came up in my mind but was never addressed by Devlin is that if the United States were increasingly relying on information-processing, perhaps the definition of productivity would change.To put Devlin's own methods to use on this particular situation, he provided his readers with data. This data was the physical words on the page which i perceived by my senses. Because I know how to read (this is a constraint), I get information from the data. Because I know how to weigh this information it becomes knowledge to me. Unfortunately, I was not given useful information and thus it caused confusion which is the opposite of being informed.Generally, this is the case with &quot;Infosense&quot; throughout. If one is prepared to believe Devlin without questioning and to use his proffered business methods and ideas, then perhaps it will work. Unfortunately, for any other kind of intellectual or beyond the surface analysis, &quot;Infosense&quot; is useless as it creates more uncertainty than it resolves."},{"Title":"Infosense: Turning Information Into Knowledge","review":"I think that to be useful, any new, breakthrough analytic tool should enable me to describe the past in a brand new way, and then based on that, say something new about the future. It should, as it were, enable me to look backward over the horizon, uncover a pattern that's never been seen before, and then look forward over the horizon to show, for all future instances, that this pattern will remain the same. If the new analytic tool is also an engineering breakthrough, I should find it very easy to apply. The tools that Keith Devlin describes for the first time for the general public, in his new book &quot;InfoSense: Turning Information into Knowledge,&quot; satisfy these criteria. He looks backward over the horizon to clarify the &quot;liar paradox&quot; of the ancient Greeks. Then he looks forward over the horizon to say things about the emerging global infrastructure of computers. In both cases, he applies new tools to discover a pattern that's evident in &quot;information.&quot; So to check on their ease of application, I applied the tools myself. I looked at another puzzle from the ancient Greeks, a fragment from Parmenides' writings that survived later book burnings-- &quot;...the same thing is for thinking and being.&quot; First, Devlin says to look for the &quot;infon.&quot; Deep in the bibliography there's mathematics that, in fact, connected infons have the structure of rigorous thought. Then Devlin says to look for the &quot;situation&quot; that supports the infon and categorize its type. (Together, the infon and its supporting situation determine the information that's conveyed.) Situations about which I can think, and which are of the type in which I can &quot;be,&quot; comprise any situation that exists and of which I'm conscious. Most generally, the type of these situations would be those that involve &quot;life,&quot; as a matter of fact, those that involve my life. But, really, isn't that just one situation-- the situation in which I exist? On this account, I get &quot;Life-- I can think about it or I can be it.&quot; OK, for a backward look over the horizon that seems easy enough. But what about the future? With a score of books under his belt Keith Devlin can be classified as a prolific author. I, for one, look forward to what he's going to say next.

To paraphrase Yoda, &quot;it surrounds us, it binds us.&quot; It has become the only &quot;tangible&quot; product many of us work with. As information becomes the most valuable asset a company has, how do we manage it all?In InfoSense, noted mathematician and popular science writer Keith Devlin shows us how to make sense of the constant flow of information that bombards us daily. What is crucial, Devlin says, is to understand the difference between data, information and knowledge.Devlin's mathematical inclinations show with his equations that illustrate his points. Equations like &quot;Information = Data + Meaning&quot; and &quot;Knowledge = Internalized information + ability to utilize the information.&quot; Essentially, information only turns into knowledge when we attach meaning to it. When we understand it. Distinguishing between the various types of info in the flow is all-important. Here are some key points addressed in the book:* Why people, not computers, are the most effective way to transfer knowledge * How social and cultural factors influence work * The hidden rules of everyday communication * How to conduct a meeting to achieve what you want * How to avoid miscommunicationDevlin's low-tech way to higher productivity is straightforward, learn how to communicate better. He shows how to converse more efficiently, how to run more effective meetings, and how to avoid miscommunication (with some shocking airline accident examples) with clear unambiguous language.Devlin uses Situation theory to illustrate how to increase productivity within a group. He says that the ideal group size is two or three. As you add more group members the likelihood of confusion increases.It seems that the more participants in a meeting, the higher the likelihood that the group will spend most of the time discussing information already known. This is because people have a tendency to discuss what they already know, and not bring up new subjects in conversation. They lack adequate &quot;common knowledge&quot; and need to be consciously guided to be effective.An example: here's how to avoid going over familiar ground in a meeting:1. Get participants to submit in advance the points they wish to make. 2. Adapt a round-robin format where each person in turn is asked to contribute something new. 3. List each new item introduced on a flipchart or a whiteboard. 4. Constantly remind the participants that the aim is to examine new information or ideas. 5. Cast the task at hand in an open-ended fashion as one of examining all the options, rather than making ajudgement or arriving at a decision. 6. Ensure that everyone in the group has a clearly defined and clearly understood area of expertise. 7. Build up the team over time, so everyone becomes familiar with one another's areas of expertise and with their strengths and weaknesses.Columbo was really creating context when, at the last minute, he turned around at the door and said &quot;Oh, and one more thing I don't understand....&quot; Experts are those who know the rules so well, they routinely break them. To become an expert at the art of communication, this is a good place to start.

And on page 10 I was excited and on page 15 , and 30 and 40 I began to be less excited...Devlin, who is supposedly a real master in the field didn't seem to provide any answers. Sometimes he would ask a good question and I got excited that there would be an equally good answer and instead found an answer that seemed like one a smart guy with very little time would come up with. This books reads like a disjointed work, like a publisher wanted another book...and fast and Devlin had to race to put together some ideas. I don't doubt Devlin is intelligent, but his assumptions seem to lack any kind of depth or definition."},{"Title":"Infosense: Turning Information Into Knowledge","review":"Keith Devlin's InfoSense is an interesting book that tries to explain and define terms such as: information, data, knowledge, constraints and conversation.In the first few chapters, Devlin defines such terms mentioned above from different points of view. He tries to explain to the common reader his own definition of Information. However, he does not give his precise definition at once and expand from it.He gives different meanings throughout the first seven chapters, that the reader has to go back to the previous chapters and try to unify all the definitions and make an understanding for his/her own. Although he states on pg. 24 that defining Information is hard to define, yet he continues to give us more definitions. He also gives the &quot;Information Equation&quot; which it is interesting, but does not explain it enough for the common reader. Throughout his book, Devlin also mentions &quot;Situation Theory.&quot; Yet, he does not give a clear explanation of it until page 39. By doing this, the reader has to go back and apply the meaning to the previous references.Starting on chapter 7, Devlin's book shifts to explain &quot;conversation&quot; and its properties. From this point on I find the book more interesting when it comes to the business world. This is the reason I give the book 4 stars. His understanding of conversation is thorough and the examples are great. Devlin's analysis of conversation and communication as a whole helps me to improve my communication skills at work as well as in other situations."},{"Title":"Infosense: Turning Information Into Knowledge","review":"Keith Devlin suggests in the preface of \\"Infosense\\" to \\"think of this book as a \`how to survive' manual for life in the knowledge age.\\" However, if the reader attempted to use this book as a survival guide he would probably find himself lost in the forest of information, with Devlin's comments acting more like fireside anecdotes and marshmallows of common-sense advice than a field manual.This book was written for professionals looking to understand the nuances of interpersonal and intracorporate communication; to Devlin's credit these subjects, as well as persuasion, developing expertise, and the basic role of computers in \\"the knowledge age\\" are all (albeit briefly) discussed. At his best, Devlin uses examples and anecdotes from his vast experience in communication research to reveal the basic principals underlying these topics. Chapters 12 through 22 deal with an array of pertinent topics: for example, in Chapters 15 and 16 Devlin explores how both national and workplace cultures effect worker productivity and creativity, citing examples from the U.S. Navy, the film \\"Waterworld,\\" and Microsoft. In these two chapters, Devlin explains that it is neither the technology nor the how-to information which drive an industry, but rather \\"that culture is the key to an efficient working infrastructure; culture endures and resists change but specific expertise [both technical and how-to information] can be acquired\\" (147). On this topic, as well as meeting discussion (Chapter 12), persuasion (Chapter 13), the nature of expertise (Chapters 17, 20, and 21), and especially information organization and sharing (Chapters 18 and 19), Devlin is well served by his anecdotal style, and workforce readers will certainly be able to identify with the presented concepts and themes.Unfortunately, during the course of Devlin's stories and advice virtually no new or innovative theories or concepts are forwarded. The author suggests \\"a 5-percent increase in output and efficiency\\" is possible if the \\"science\\" (Devlin's quotes) in his book is used as the basis of ones understanding of communication. In actuality, the 5-percent increase would come from the refresher course Devlin offers in basic management theory and implementation that any businessperson would surely get from an intro management or leadership course in college. While his anecdotes are entertaining and compelling, it seems Devlin reinvents the wheel several times under the guise of his \\"science\\" - termed \\"Situation Theory.\\"Devlin presents Situation Theory as his \\"manual for life in the knowledge age.\\" Beginning in the prologue, the author promises to \\"outline the basic science and give some applications...both in everyday life and in real companies\\" (p.5). While Devlin obviously succeeds in the second of these goals, it is the first that makes \\"Infosense\\" problematic. For example, during the first 6 chapters Devlin continuously attempts to define the key term \\"information.\\" In the meandering discussion of the first 68 pages, Devlin defines information as: \\"Information=Data + Meaning\\" (p.12), \\"Information=Representation + Procedure for encoding/decoding\\" (p.32), \\"Information=Representation + Constraint\\" (p.33), \\"information is context-dependent\\" (p.37), and (my personal favorite) \\"information tells us something about something\\" (p.61). By the end of this string of defining and redefining, the reader is left solidly confused as to what information is, let alone how it is applicable to Devlin's Situation Theory.As if that weren't confusing enough, Chapters 7, 8, 9, and 11 attempt to apply this befuddled view if information and Situation Theory to conversation. These 40 pages can be summarized in two simple statements: 1) Conversation relies on the background of the speakers and the situation they are in, and 2) The more people that are in a conversation, the greater chance of confusion. These very simple and obvious natures of human interaction are hammered home again and again, often belaboring the same points and failing to analyze exceptions to the rules. To add to the difficulty, illustrations have been added which only complicate what should be a fairly straightforward discussion. With the exception of Chapter 10 (an interesting example highlighting the art of persuasion), the first 11 chapters of \\"Infosense\\" are a cluttered collection of facts, common-sense advice, and jargon which do little to increase the readers understanding of information or how it is applicable to the workplace. As this is both Devlin's stated purpose and the target audience's (\\"the CEO, the middle manager, the ambitious young assistant, the office worker...\\" p. Viii) goal in reading the book, \\"Infosense\\" falls regretfully short, at least in this half of the book.In final analysis, Devlin's \\"Infosense\\" can be read by anyone looking for an anecdotal introduction or refresher of basic management and/or communication skills. I would not recommend buying it (especially in hardcover), but the stories of the second half of the book, if taken as solid examples of the fundamental points they emphasize, certainly warrant checking it out at the library."},{"Title":"Infosense: Turning Information Into Knowledge","review":"In the preface, Devlin says, &quot;This book is written for the professional business person&quot;. That is one explanation of why this book is so dry. Even though he gives examples of how to improve the efficiency of information management, the language he uses is difficult for the average person to read and understand. I am a college student and I was required to read this book for one my classes. I have found that most of the students in the class have a hard time reading this book, can not understand it, and do not like it. I find that the information from this book is valuable, but this is not a book I would read on my own or for fun.I think we can all benefit from knowing the information he is trying to impart, but it is too difficult for the layman to read and comprehend. I agree with his statement that, \\"Already today and especially tomorrow, a basic understanding of information will be as important as were farming skills in the agricultural age or basic industrial skills in the industrial age\\". Knowing how to turn information into knowledge is crucial. I agree with Devlin in his thought that we need to develop a solid science of information. If you can wade through the language that Devlin is using, then this book can be helpful in doing just that.Overall, this book is not terrible. It is repetitive and not a \\"fun\\" read, but the book does contain some important and/or helpful information. I would *only* recommend this book for business people."},{"Title":"Infosense: Turning Information Into Knowledge","review":"In Keith Devlin's business-oriented book, Infosense, he describes how to make sense of the constant flow of information. By describing how information differentiates between knowledge and data, he attempts to show how businesses and individuals can benefit from information management. Devlin goes into detail to explain important terms associated with information and its incorporation with communication. He especially focuses on the distinction between information, knowledge, and data. Although it may seem that Devlin is benefiting his audience of mainly executives and managers, he is actually confusing other individuals who may read his work.If Devlin's intent is to explain how businesses and individuals can benefit from information management, then there needs to be a clear-cut definition of information. He does not ever do this in Infosense. In pages 12-16, Devlin writes a section titled &quot;What is Information?&quot; yet never tells us his definition of it. This can create confusion in any reader's head that is trying to grasp his concepts. In addition, Devlin ends up sounding very repetitious by continually discussing the same topics over and over. Although he does this in portions of his book, he introduces an idea of &quot;situation theory&quot; on page 6 and refers back to it often without fully explaining it. It seems that Devlin is attempting to be technical, but finishes being repetitive and sometimes vague.In parts of Infosense, it is obvious that Devlin is a mathematician. Throughout various parts of the book, he uses diagrams and examples that become extremely confusing to someone without his background. He uses algebra problems with variables on page 68 to aid in the explanation. To an executive this may even be a challenge to comprehend. At a point in the book, Devlin turns the topic of discussion from differences of information, knowledge, and data to being a good manager. The areas discussed go from description to explanation of &quot;how-to.&quot; These subjects of how to run meetings and have an effective conversation are part of the communication process, but can be talked about more fully in a complete other book or incorporated into Infosense more smoothly. Devlin's work should have been more carefully planned out.Although there are many elements that create uncertainty, some aspects of Infosense may be beneficial to those trying to advance their career. As far as a reading level, it is not difficult. There is not a challenging vocabulary and there is use of a simple sentence structure. Clever anecdotes to enhance the need for information in the communication process are used in the book. Such as the one about the miscommunication causing a plane crash on page 9, these are the most interesting parts of the book. There is a summary at the end of each chapter which precisely says all that is stated in that chapter. Some things are said much more exactly in the summary than in the chapter. Throughout the chapters there seems to be extra rubbish that is unnecessary for the explanations. The chapter summaries narrowed down what needed to be said in the first place.Overall, Keith Devlin's Infosense is a book that could have effectively explained the theory of information, but did not. Devlin wrote the book for executives and managers of big businesses to advance their careers. As far as helping them think more abstractly and mathematically about information, Infosense is a worthy source. However, if you are looking for precise answers of what information is, then this is not the place to look. Devlin discusses knowledge extensively, but this book does not leave you knowledgeable. No sense is made of Keith Devlin's Infosense."},{"Title":"Infosense: Turning Information Into Knowledge","review":"I would recommend this book for everybody. I personally believe it truly depends on the audience. I found the book far from being boring or &quot;mind boggling&quot;. I was a bit lost towards the beginning but caught up what Devlin was getting at through reading the chapters that followed. Its pretty good for business oriented people. As a college student I would say its above average. The chapters are short and have useful summaries. Well atleast to me it shows the author took the readers into consideration while writing 'Infosense'.As a mathemetician, Devlin used equations to distinguish between information, data and knowledge. He wants his readers to understand knowledge and information based on a scientific logical foundation. The author provides equations such as &quot;Information = Data + Meaning&quot; (p.14) and &quot;Knowledge = Internalized information + ability to utilize the information.&quot;(p.15). In essence information only turns into knowledge when we attach meaning to it. Anyone can obtain information but comprehending it makes it meaningful.Devlin and his colleagues have used Situation theory, which they have procured mathematically and come up with interesting strategies to increase productivity and improvement within a group. He mentions that the ideal group size is two or three and with the addition of more group members the likelihood of confusion increases. I think this is obvious. This reminds me of a newspaper article I recently read. It was in the Baltimore Sun, and the article discussed the enormous class size of the University of Maryland. Imagine you are a student in a class of 450(or so). It is pretty obvious that it would be easier for Western Maryland College students (in a class of 30 or less) to deal with the information (class lectures) when you communicate back and forth with the professor and your classmates. We in a small group of people are more likely to attach meaning to the data and gain knowledge faster than would UMD students.Incidentally my College Park friends disagree with me on this argue that it all depends on the professor capability to manage the class. They are mistaken ofcourse, because our chances of confusion and misunderstandings multiply far faster than our brainpower. But,I have no doubt Devlin is right on the right track with this idea. Furthermore, Devlin has also discussed that &quot;information immersion&quot; can make communication more efficient by increasing the overlap between team member's individual contexts. Also, he has used good examples to point out the situation theory view of information and how it can prevent complexities. The airline disasters and the poorly designed ATM are examples of this.Also, like others I found the tiles of the chapters intriguing. I think the author is very good at specifying examples. In page 161 he discusses IBM's computer Deep blue, which beat world champion Garry Kasparov in 1997. Devlin explains that while computers process information human expertise involves knowledge.As I mentioned before this book is highly recommended for the average businessperson because of the practical information that Devlin provides in this book. He has discussed Microsoft's electronic knowledge guide (SPUD) and People and information finder (PIF) which could better help manage organizations. Hence, to turn this fruitful information into knowledge a business person would have to apply it."},{"Title":"Infosense: Turning Information Into Knowledge","review":"As primarily a business-oriented book, Infosense is intended to improve the flow of information, particularly in companies. The initial problem with any book discussing an academic theory is to keep it in terms which the intended audience can understand and use. However, by keeping to 'Dick-and-Jane' simplicity, the clarity of Devlin's overall work suffers.Throughout the first chapter alone, confusion ensues. Devlin attempts give a functional definition for the terms data, information and knowledge but does not ensure the reader's understanding of this. Giving no precise definitions, Devlin leaves the reader to comprehend by oblique means. First, he writes that &quot;Whatever it is, information can be a valuable commodity, to be collected, guarded, duplicated, sold, stolen and sometimes killed for&quot; as he is leading up to an explanation.However, the explanation is quickly derailed by the statement that first we must understand data and then we must understand knowledge, and so on until it is skipped over completely to follow the path of how information flows and solving problems.Devlin often returns to his favorite buzzphrase &quot;Situation Theory&quot; which he has been involved in for more than ten years. Even as he tries to trace most of his assertions back to this wondrous cure-all, one has even less of an understanding of this theory than of information. One more into the oblique, my friend.Since &quot;Infosense&quot; was penned by a mathematician, one might expect a horrid series of equations and scientific methodology (which occur in small, easy to use quantities although not very useful) but instead find unsubstatiated numbers in many of his examples. An early discussion surrounding the effect of the growth of necessary information-processing on productivity in the United States starting in 1950 to today. Data abounds in an attempt to exemplify that we do not as yet know how to utilize information. However, no sources are cited for his data nor is 'productivity' ever defined. A question which came up in my mind but was never addressed by Devlin is that if the United States were increasingly relying on information-processing, perhaps the definition of productivity would change.To put Devlin's own methods to use on this particular situation, he provided his readers with data. This data was the physical words on the page which i perceived by my senses. Because I know how to read (this is a constraint), I get information from the data. Because I know how to weigh this information it becomes knowledge to me. Unfortunately, I was not given useful information and thus it caused confusion which is the opposite of being informed.Generally, this is the case with &quot;Infosense&quot; throughout. If one is prepared to believe Devlin without questioning and to use his proffered business methods and ideas, then perhaps it will work. Unfortunately, for any other kind of intellectual or beyond the surface analysis, &quot;Infosense&quot; is useless as it creates more uncertainty than it resolves."},{"Title":"STERNBERG'S DIAGNOSTIC SURGICAL PATHOLOGY","review":"I am really greatful for your services!The books arrived in Greece from USA within 15 days,much earlier than the message from amazon referred.Moreover the products arrived in perfect condition!That was the bigger surprise for me as,to tell you the truth,I expected that there would be at least some little damage(don't forget the journey of 11000Km)or,worst,the books would arrive in pieces.Nothing of this happened and now I have the confidence to create a whole medical library from you.thank you again amazon!"},{"Title":"STERNBERG'S DIAGNOSTIC SURGICAL PATHOLOGY","review":"This book would be better if there were not so many mistakes in tables, figures, text...

However,consistently, he gives the name of an entity in one place in the books/volumes and then every where else it is only reffered to by its abbreviation. So now if you don't remember the abbreviation you have to hunt for it ealier in the chapter or in other chapters all together. And of course the abbreviation is not in the glossary nor is there a seperate index of abbreviations. I find that this adds unnecessary distractions and time to what should be smooth studying."},{"Title":"STERNBERG'S DIAGNOSTIC SURGICAL PATHOLOGY","review":"When I initially received my copies of the new Sternberg I was concerned that the volumes' lighter weight would translate into deficits in content. After using the new edition during two busy months on the surg path service, however, I have found it to be even more substantive than its predecessor (apparently we can thank the new edition's improved portability to slightly thinner pages and smaller text). Because I store my old edition at work and my new copies at home, there have been multiple instances when, after initially reviewing a section while previewing at the office, I have returned home and been met with a more reader-friendly and content-rich review in the new edition. Even without these improvements the new edition would be worth purchasing for the images alone. The quantity and quality of the images are greatly improved from the previous edition, and the photographs almost uniformly lack the awkward blue backgrounds, poor contrast, overbearing fuchsias etc. that plague so many pathology publications. While some readers have taken issue with the changes in tone and areas of redundancy inherent to a multi-authored book, I have found it far more reassuring to take advice from the experts in each field than from a single source. I have minor complaints about certain subtopics, most notably the portion on vascular tumors of the bone, but overall have found the new edition to be an excellent investment."},{"Title":"STERNBERG'S DIAGNOSTIC SURGICAL PATHOLOGY","review":"This is an excellent book. It is helpful to have a single reference for the vast majority of your needs in surgical pathology. Obviously, it can't be everything. You sacrifice consistent style for the variety of authors -- similarly this translates into some sections being easier to use than others. Also, at times I want more pictures, but then this is not an atlas. Overall, I have found most of the sections to be of high quality, with good information and good pictures. I am very happy with my purchase.Recommendations for the next edition:1. even more pictures2. even more charts comparing diseases or features3. inset boxes with key features in each disease"},{"Title":"STERNBERG'S DIAGNOSTIC SURGICAL PATHOLOGY","review":"A highly uneven text. Lucid chapters are interspersed with idiosyncratic (and, frankly, poorly-written) ones. The occasional chapter rambles its convoluted way to near-incomprehensibility. Many entities have key descriptive features buried within verbiage. Picture reproduction is (very) unsatisfactory, with a chromatic skew towards pink. Picture size has shrunk from the previous edition. The font is perversely minuscule, and extremely thin paper is used (those of us who highlight - pick one's pen wisely, or the other printed page might well be ruined). This latest edition of a classic text is still worth spending time (and money) on (not least for the incorporation of latest WHO classifications and IHC stains). The recommendation cannot but be with many reservations though."},{"Title":"STERNBERG'S DIAGNOSTIC SURGICAL PATHOLOGY","review":"I thought the book was excellent.

Entities like DFSP and Giant cell fibroblastoma are grouped under fibrohistiocytic lesions along with benign fibrous histiocytoma. Variants of fibrous histiocytoma are described two pages later without any continuity with fibrous histiocytoma.

Compared to Rosai, Sternberg benefits clearly from the advantage of multiauthorship (a generally very high level of expertise in every section--NO one even Rosai can be entirely on top of this range of material) and suffers from the disadvantage of multiauthorship (widely differing writing styles and writing skill-some chapters of Sternberg really needed more editorial control)The level of completeness and depth here IS impressive and does overall exceed Rosai BUT it has led to one substantial and unfortunate decision. In order to get so much into 2 volumes that could be lifted by a normal human being without fear of omni-sphincteric herniation, the decision was made to downsize the print size significantly ?6. This really hampers the ability to read the book for any period of time and reduces it to a \\"pick it up and put it down (quickly)\\" reference source. One could peer into this book for a specific question. However anyone attempting to plow through even a chapter written with this tiny print size, (much less read this cover to cover) would need a large hand lens and a bottle of Advil.

Full of warmth, eloquence, and, at times, poetic sensibilities, Che&#8217;s diaries show us how the Cuban communist leadership was forged in battle; how the revolutionary combatants cemented bonds with peasants in the countryside and with workers in the cities; and how a popular revolutionary government was built on these foundations.

This book by Che shows how Fidel Castro's revolutionary movement has always taken the moral high ground, going back to their triumph over hated dictator Batista. Che documents the reasons for this in these articles, many of which were written as the fighting was going on. He discusses the revolutionaries' respect for the peasants and the way the peasants helped to move the revolutionaries toward a deeper understanding of the class forces involved in the Cuban revolution. This made it possible to integrate many peasants into the revolutionary army. Che describes the care that was taken to treat rank and file enemy soldiers well, especially the wounded. His crystal clear writing style and fine sense of humor are based on a total grasp of the situation.

The book is filled to the brim with facts, and history of a brewing giant. The book begins with Jacob Best and his brewery in 1844 to the fall of the Pabst Brewery in the 1940's. Cochran really does a great job of showing Pabst's place in both Wisconsin and in the brewing industry on a world scale. He also does a great job of showing who Captain Frederick Pabst really was, a brilliant businessman, philanthropist, and family man.

The editing section was a surprise bonus for me. I've learned more about editing from this book than from any other book I've read. The author is obviously a great filmmaker and a great teacher.

This book rocked! Get this book! Go Documentary Institute! ;) Yeah!"},{"Title":"Directing the Documentary","review":"An excellent book, especially for those who are new in the field. Among other things, Michael Rabiger guides you through a brief history of the documentary genre, helps you discover your creative identity, acquaintes you with the film vocabulary, and introduces you to the genre through a variety of projects that you are encouraged to undertake. Directing the Documentary is definitely a textbook (no wonder it's one of the &quot;must read&quot; books at the Department of TV Documentary in Goldsmith's College in London) and Michael Rabiger is an excellent teacher. Lacking the pretentiousness of many other teachers, he uses simple language to describe various aspects of the documentary and never underestimates his reader / student. A lover of the genre himself, he knows how to make you feel confident for having chosen the documentary as a career. He never patronizes you and all the advice that he gives is given with a friendly and generous tone. Mr Rabiger is a thoughtful and sensitive teacher, but also an excellent author, or &quot;storyteller,&quot; as he prefers to call the documentarist. His words flow, like in a good novel, making you want to read on and on, while at the same time they are so pregnant with meaning that they make you stop and think about them. Having read his book, and being a student myself, I would like to say a warm &quot;thank you&quot; to Mr Rabiger for his sensitivity and generosity as a teacher."},{"Title":"Directing the Documentary","review":"This is probably the best book on directing and producing a documentary film that I've come across. A lot of books on filmmaking seem to be written by people who've never really made any films but can rehash what others have written on the subject and sell their advice.

A comprehensive resource, Directing The Documentary covers issues of aesthetics and authorship, how to develop one's artistic identity while staying true to the source material, skills of screencraft, issues to keep a close eye on in preproduction, production, and postproduction, the educational background needed to direct documentaries and how to go about getting work in one's chosen field, and more. From knowing when to use narration and when to be aware of its drawbacks, to being acutely aware of schedule logistics with respect to different types and lengths of documentaries, to important legal issues to remain aware of - not the least of which is the personal release form in which signatory individuals allow one to make public the material that has been shot - Directing The Documentary is an absolute \\"must-have\\" for any would-be nonfiction movie director.

Right away, his advice improved my project planning and helped me make a much better project pitch than I originally had.

I recommend it to students and professionals alike."},{"Title":"Of All the Gaul: Latin for Kids","review":"This book contains interesting facts about Latin in an entertaining style. I ordered it for my 9-year-old, who loves it! However, it is by no means sufficient for learning the language. A large portion contains English words with Latin roots, Roman numbers, and a great summary of what we inherited from the Romans with some details. The advantage is that kids can read it by themselves, so if you have a child who would like to learn Latin but you aren't sure if (s)he would be serious about it once you invested in a private tutor, give this book a try!"},{"Title":"Of All the Gaul: Latin for Kids","review":"I thought this book might be a useful supplement to a Latin class I'm teaching.

Most of the book is a juvenile, repetitive rant about lawyers, judges and ex-wives. Example:&quot;Whoa. Hang in there. Don't give up. Bad as it might be, divorce is just an expensive journey through our illustrious justice sewer, I mean, system.&quot;The book focuses mostly on how the husband will get screwed by the legal system, yet there is little practical advice about the legal aspects of divorce. For example, in the back of the book is a list of which states are community property states, and which are equitable distribution, yet it is never explained what these terms mean. There is a whole chapter on going through a divorce when one has a girlfriend, yet it is not mentioned that this may in some states be a very bad idea. In the list in the back of the book, it's obtusely referred to as &quot;Alimony barred by marital misconduct&quot;. Several things discussed under &quot;Hide Your Money&quot; border on criminal.The book's barely redeeming feature is it's advice on dealing with the emotional trauma of divorce, and the various reactions different types of women have to the suspicion or reality that their husband is leaving them."},{"Title":"How to Dump Your Wife: Practical Advice for the Good Man Trapped in A Bad Marriage","review":"I read this book after being dumped by my partner of 27 years because I honestly wanted to see the man's side of things. Well, the cruel and so-called &quot;humorous&quot; tips on how to cheat on your wife and deprive her of her legal rights confirmed what people warned: You've become just a business deal and a chess game to him. It helped me anticipate (especially the chapter on How to Hide Your Money) what Mr. Wonderful and his new woman (of course, 15 years younger) would eventually do--write off romantic interludes as &quot;business expenses&quot;, put his income in her name and live happily ever after--2,000 miles away so he'd never have to co-parent. Six figure income and European travel, yet no alimony and only 800 a month child support? In fact, it cost me a fortune in legal bills just to defend against bogus affidavits by HIS attorney, designed to scare me into compliance. This is the kind of guy who will later whine that his kids are strangers and his ex-wife is a witch. And guess what Mr. Covington--did you warn the prospective new wife/girlfriend that whatever he did to #1 to get to her, is probably what he'll do to her to get to #3? I found this book unfortunately polarizing and cruel, but at least it served as warning of what I was up against. For something really valuable, both genders should read Crazy Time. Nobody wins in a divorce, especially not the girlfriend who's egged it on."},{"Title":"How to Dump Your Wife: Practical Advice for the Good Man Trapped in A Bad Marriage","review":"It seems to me that this book appeals to the most selfish sort of husband or girl friend. It is too bad that a person who would agree with the things said in this book would be very unlikely to become more happy after following the advice given. Unless a person learns to be less selfish, I am quite sure a man will discover that the perfect girl friend, who has now become the perfect wife, will in no time turn into what the author calls Wife One, Wife Two or Wife Three, which are three stereotypical kinds of problem wives. Likewise, the man who remains single with his piles of hidden money bags is unlikely to find a bit of happiness until he can learn about truth and justice. It's not a pleasant world for the man who must suspect every person of being just as dishonest and inequitable as he has been."},{"Title":"How to Dump Your Wife: Practical Advice for the Good Man Trapped in A Bad Marriage","review":"Get the book before your wife had put her hands on it all.

She was on the radio talking about it. I had thought it was a man. My ignorance. I am the first to admit that divorce is horrible but sometimes necessary. Ask any loving man that has a self absorbed wife. Men get the short end of the stick in divorce and this is the one book you will find that addresses how you can get out with more than just the shirt on your back which she (and I mean her lawyer not her) will still try to get. The main thing is planning. If you plan ahead you will make divorce as painless for you as possible. If you are a woman reading this and think god how could someone write about this, take a look at the number of books written on the reverse side that show how to squeeze a man until he cries like a choir boy.

This nitty-gritty, practical advice (from a non-Legal-Professional, non-Helping-Professional) aligns very much with what the lawyer and I have been saying to my Man who is finally ready for a divorce after 20 years (kid had to grow up first.) As we all realize, IF a man has a girlfriend waiting patiently for him, she is not the cause of the breakup and the author points out how supportive she can be, and needs to be. My only (slight) objection to the generally good references about the girlfriend is that ALL examples except one assume that she is naturally a &quot;younger woman.&quot; Many times she will be. But, same age and &quot;older&quot; women are often girlfriends of divorcing men, also. The under-35&quot; female is NOT favored by lots of men, for a variety of reasons, (which may not align with the author's personal preferences.)

I am not naive to the fact that the heroine is usually incredibly beautiful, but I was surprised that Zach was actually \\"more\\" attracted to her because of her caucasian features. There is a line where he actually compares her to her, \\"moonface\\" friends.

He wishes to introduce her back to the White world where he believes that she belongs. White Feather agrees with Zach even though Abby wishes to remain with the people she grew up with. Zach takes Abby away to the nearest white settlement. Zach finds himself falling for the headstrong white Cheyenne and Abby does her utmost to rebuff him but she too finds herself falling for the handsome officer.I found this book to be an average romance. Zach was a galant hero but I found Abby/Tears Like Rain a rather annoying character. I just couldn't warm to her. There are a couple of steamy sex scenes but I couldn't really find the love story hidden under the lust story. Read it if you really enjoy native American Western romances but if like me you're not a big fan, give it a miss.Lea Ling Tsang"},{"Title":"Tears Like Rain","review":"It was one of the best books that I read.

There was really no exciting parts. The only conflict between Zach and Abby was that she couldn't be accepted in the white society."},{"Title":"Harm's Way (Alan Gregory)","review":"Well, as far as I'm concerned, Stephen White has done it again. He has provided me with another enjoyable and plausible whodunnit with just the right mix of psychological tension and everyday police work.This is also a sad story because Alan happens to lose a man he considers his friend. What makes it worse, is that the friend he loses happens to be his next door neighbor and the husband of another friend, Urologist Adrienne Arvin.Peter Arvin has been in several of the other Alan Gregory novels but this will obviously be his last. His murder is not an isolated one but rather, one that is part of a series. Or is it?Stephen White provides the reader with additional history on Peter and background that explains many things, especially the relationship he has with his wife. If ever a pair appeared mismatched, Peter and Adrienne were. She is a successful urologist but also outgoing and sarcastic in an east coast sort of way. Peter is more introverted and a very gifted carpenter, almost more artist than craftsman. Now that is all over.Behind him Peter leaves his wife, who to be honest, doesn't appear to be overly aggrieved by Peter's murder. He also leaves an infant son. White introduces us to the Arvin's au pair, Lisa who is more than she appears to be. However, Alan Gregory and the reader do not find out the whole truth until much later but Lisa plays a very significant role and is more than a nanny to young Jonas Arvin.Throughout the book, Lauren Crowder, Alan's new wife continues to support him and serve as a sounding board for his psychological theories. She also shows an uncanny knack for playing the sexual tease just when Alan needs that outlet most. White does a nice job of writing about the Gregorys who, we find out at the beginning of this book are just married. That took me by surprise but then again, that's what you get for reading the books in this series out of order. I enjoyed this book as much as the others in the series and from here I head off to read CRITICAL CONDITIONS. I 'm looking forward to more time with Alan, Lauren, Sam Purdy, Adrienne, little Jonas and the dog, Emily."},{"Title":"Harm's Way (Alan Gregory)","review":"I have now read almost all of the Alan Gregory series and really liked this one very much.

Why?Because I liked almost all the characters in the book - I teetered toward four stars.Because there was too much theater jargon - I tottered toward three stars.Because I thought I had the mystery mostly figured out, but I was mostly wrong - I wavered again toward four stars.Because in the end, a previously stable character became quite the wacko and nobody seemed to notice let alone care - I teetered back to three stars.However, because I really enjoyed reading the story despite its very strange ending: four big stars.If you like Stephen White, I'd imagine that you'll like, Harm's Way and if you are reading the series, this is definately not one to skip. If you have never read any others in this series, I'd suggest you begin with the first one and work your way through. Harm's Way is the fourth in the Alan Gregory series and it's worth the time investment to start at the beginning."},{"Title":"Harm's Way (Alan Gregory)","review":"This is the fourth in the series with Dr. Alan Gregory. I say that, because to fully appreciate this book, I think you should read the first three books. I'm not giving anything away, the synopsis says that in this book Alan's good friend Peter is murdered. Peter was a 'unique' person. He was a private person, a daredevil and a talented craftsman.There are the usual twists and turns, as well as vivid descriptions of the Colorado landscape. The whodunit was a little bit far fetched, but for me I could overlook that because I was immersed in learning more about Peter and Adrienne. Friendships and how well we really know each other are a major theme. Alan and Lauren are now newlyweds and getting to further know eachother as well.This series differes from others too in that Alan's wife has multiple sclerosis. The disease and it's impact on her life, and thus on his are dealt with really well. Lauren remains a vibrant, sexy woman, despite her MS."},{"Title":"Harm's Way (Alan Gregory)","review":"Tried to get interested but I find the character of Alan Gregory just a bore. There are some fine sequences in this book but I felt like I was reading one of those parlor mysteries where the ramblings of the main characters were more important than the mystery itself. When the villian is revealed at the end I found myself not buying it. Maybe because of the lack of real character development or the lack of empathy for Alan Gregory. This is the third Alan Gregory novel by Stephen White that I have read and this time I have asked myself 'is that all there is? I think that this series is worth the effort to read but I warn you not to start with this entry. You may be put off and ignore others from this author which are very good reads. Also be aware that some books of the series shift the main character emphasis from Alan Gregory to Lauren Crowder, his girl firend/wife."},{"Title":"Harm's Way (Alan Gregory)","review":"This book's plot hinges on an event buried in the smoke of a victim's past. The event is a rip-off of Norman McLean's moving investigation of a fatal fire in 1949 entitled &quot;Young Men and Fire.&quot; Perhaps Stephen White thought that by acknowledging McLean's work up front he could get away with a barely disguised retelling of the same tragedy. It doesn't work, at least not if one has read the original. While there is one enjoyable chase involving a cement mixer, it's not enough to overcome the author's misguided infatuation with McLean's powerful, original work"},{"Title":"Harm's Way (Alan Gregory)","review":"I enjoy Mr. White but this one just doesn't cut it. Every book requires the suspension of disbelief but this time he asks for too much and then he doesn't deliver the goods. We're to believe that this particular killer could lift a dead body up and dump it into a cement mixer? Or that this killer is strong enough to suspend one of the victims from his feet with a sword? Not to mention that all this fancy and bizarrely sick killing is done by someone that has been otherwise a model citizen up to now? The psychology just doesn't match. Not buying it. I could go on and on about the other implausibilities. The least of which is that this killer had all this time to slip off unnoticed to do all the killing given their role in the story. Come on, Sam would have noticed.

He dies in the emergency room of a hospital, the apparent victim of a ritual killing. Police Detective Sam Purdy asks Dr. Alan Gregory to create a psychological profile of the murderer. Peter's widow Adrienne also asks Alan to find out more about her dead husband's past. She realizes that there is so much she does not know about him.The dark secret in Peter's background involved his work as a counselor at a wilderness camp for boys during the summer of 1982. Peter and two other young adults were leading a group of six boys on a survival experience. The group was caught in a wildfire and one boy died. The catastrophe converted Peter into a dedicated loner who seemed to have developed a total lack of trust in others. His sense of guilt became so severe that he built a coffin for himself with the date of the fire inscribed at eye level on the inside of the coffin's lid.Alan concludes that there is a connection between the fire and Peter's murder. He sees the Denver murder as the act of a different person who probably committed suicide shortly after the crime. Detective Dale Hunter disagrees and argues that both murders were done by the same killer. Sam and Alan remain unconvinced and as they continue to follow their own leads, they begin to realize that they will be lucky to finish this case alive.The author is a clinical psychologist whose greatest strength lies in the development of memorable chacters who come to life in his novels."},{"Title":"Harm's Way (Alan Gregory)","review":"When Dr Alan Gregory's good friend Peter Arvin is found dying on the stage of a Colorado theater, suspicion soars that he is the second victim of a serial killer.

Did the guilty party have a sick taste for show biz? Was the murderer inspired by greed or by vengeance? Or by forbidden sex? Alan Gregory follows the trail of naked violence and hidden shame from Denver to the peaceful town of Boulder and to the wanton wonderland of Jackson Hole. He thought he knew his late late friend--but what he didn't know could kill him...."},{"Title":"Harm's Way (Alan Gregory)","review":"[...] Having read enough cozies in my life to still be able to count them on one hand, I have come to the probably erroneous conclusion that the main difference between the cozy mystery and the hard-boiled detective novel is that the investigator in the cozy is never in quite as much immediate physical danger as is the hard-boiled chap. Even if the chap in question isn't too hard-boiled.Such is the case with Boulder, CO psychiatrist Alan Gregory, the hero of Stephen White's open-ended series of mystery/thrillers. regory spends his time getting shot at, beaten about the head, henpecked, and otherwise threatened by a bevy of adversaries and never enjoying it much. The best kind of detective-- an amateur who gets too wrapped up in his cases.In this case, it's hard to avoid. The victim is Gregory's next door neighbor, a woodcraftsman who was designing sets for a theatre production in town. The murder is similar in some ways to a previous murder in Denver, and so the local police start thinking \\"serial killer.\\" Gregory's PD pal Sam Purdy hires him on as an amateur profiler, and away we go.Stephen White is a solid writer of thrillers, easily as good as any of the A-list names working in the genre today. His lack of widespread readership continues to baffle me. Harm's Way is of a piece with the rest of the Alan Gregory novels, and comes just as highly recommended from this camp. *** 1/2"},{"Title":"Harm's Way (Alan Gregory)","review":"The Alan Gregory series is one of the few mystery series that I've read over the years, eagerly awaiting the next new release. At the same time, my husband is just now reading them for the first time and I've been re-reading the old books so I can enjoy them with him. So, with the perspective of nine books, I opine that this is not one of the best.It's an ok read but nothing that kept me up past my bedtime. I'm not sure what doesn't work in the book. After the high politics of Higher Authority, this book seems somewhat mundane. The victim, Peter, is interesting but not very empathetic. It's hard to care much about him and why he died. The book is a bit too scattered with too many deaths. Perhaps my lack of satisfaction derived from the ending which is far too skimpy and leaves many questions unanswered. Also, the usual poking fun at Coloradans (and Boulder in particular) is lacking.Bottom-line: I'm still a big fan of this series. First time readers of the series are strongly encouraged to start at the beginning (Private Practices) since it is much more enjoyable to grow with the central cast of characters."},{"Title":"Harm's Way (Alan Gregory)","review":"Stephen White has the courage to kill off a beloved recurring character in the first chapter!

I learned more than I wanted to know about theatre, and having Peter gruesomely killed depressed me, but the mystery was top-notch.I suspect that the novel would be less enjoyable for readers who missed the first three of the series, so buy the others, too. And don't stop here; the series keeps getting better with each new book. I've already pre-ordered Kill Me, number 14, to be released in March."},{"Title":"Harm's Way (Alan Gregory)","review":"I have read four of White's fiction novels. I would give the first three a combined rating of 9 on a 1--10 scale. Harm's Way was for me a very disappointing read. I thought the book started well with all of the elements of a great suspense novel. Then it was as if I was reading a college text on &quot;Mechanical Theater 101&quot;. It was far too repititious with theater jargon through three quarters of the mid-book. The last fifteen pages were vintage White. So, to wrap it up, the book could have been one fourth it's length and been a very good piece of work!"},{"Title":"Harm's Way (Alan Gregory)","review":"Stephen White is a good, but uneven writer. He has a great knack for writing a riveting thriller, for developing interesting characters and for presenting complex plots. But in each of his books that I have read, he tends to let the plot get away from him. I found this book to be enjoyable and fast-paced. But the ending just seemed to be arbitrary and a little too contrived. The several murders in the book are solved at the end, but when the killer is revealed, you find yourself saying \\"Huh?\\" In other words, the ending is a bit of a stretch. But although I found the plot-ending a little too contrived, I DID enjoy the book, for its action, its intricacies and its description of the Boulder/Denver scene, particularly the several theaters which figure prominently in the book. All in all, it was a good read -- it just could have been a little better."},{"Title":"Harm's Way (Alan Gregory)","review":"Clinical psychologist Alan Gregory and his new wife Lauren, a Boulder assistant DA, are stunned at the grizzly, late-night staged death of next-door neighbor Peter at a Boulder theater where he helped out with set construction. Worse, the death mirrors another one of a few weeks earlier in a Denver theater. When a third death occurs, the idea that a serial killer is at work is overwhelming.The book revolves around resolving the conflicting evidence pointing to one killer in some ways, but multiple participants in other ways. Alan is recruited by Boulder detective Sam Purdy to create a psychological profile of the killer(s). In addition, largely at the request of Peter's urologist wife Adrienne, Alan attempts to unravel Peter's past, where a fire that he survived seemed to be transforming. Adrienne's nanny Lisa is a beguiling character, who knows a lot about Peter. Sam's terseness is toned down as he works with female Denver detective Dale Hunter, obviously interested in him.The book deteriorates a bit at the end with the action ramping up considerably and the perpetrator(s) revealed not being particularly convincing - almost plucked out of thin air. Nonetheless, the author continues to have an easily digestible writing style and keeps his characters interesting. Overall, a pretty good entry in the Alan Gregory series."},{"Title":"Harm's Way (Alan Gregory)","review":"This is a good book, but it's not White's best. I liked the mixture of the main plot with elements of Alan's personal life, including his relationships with his wife and friends. This particular story had a good number of red herrings thrown into the mix, so readers will find themselves incorrectly guessing certain plot twists (which is always fun!).The only thing that I didn't like was the strong element of the theater and related jargon.

The author dispels several misconceptions about Islam and Christianity, and he builds a solid legal case of the eminence of \\"AL-Mesih Isa\\" (Messiah Yeshua/Christ Jesus) directly from the Qur'an. I've read several books on Islam, but this one is different. It is not angry and confrontational, but instead is gentle and loving.

Because if someone doesn't believe that Islam is a valid religion, it can't be used to 'prove' something else.

The product was in superior condition, autographed by author as promised, and an excellent resource for Christians who have Muslim friends with questions about Christianity."},{"Title":"Glad news : \\"God loves you, my Muslim friend\\"","review":"This is an interesting if somewhat simplistic book whose main focus is to rely on verses from the Qur'an to establish the divinity of Jesus and to contrast that with similar assertion from the bible. There is nothing new here. Muslims already believe in the divinity of Jesus message and believe that Jesus is like no other man before him or after him because he was born out of immaculate conception and was able to perform many miracles. Still Muslims believe Jesus is a prophet not God.The author, of course, tries to make a case that the prince of peace is in fact the son of God. Such conclusion is a matter of faith and can not be not proven by argument or logic. One, in fact, may argue that the bible itself reveals Jesus as the son of man (John 5:26-27 and Mathew 24:30) and as the son of Mary (Mathew 25:31-46.) One may also argue that all humans including Jesus are the children of God.The Qur'an today is the same one revealed to Mohammed 1400 years ago. Only one Arabic version exists. The bible, on the other hand, has undergone several cycles of translations and numerous editions. It stands to reason that some points may have been altered to reflect the bias and cultural background of the editors and translators. There is even one English version in which God is referred to as ALAH: Page 3 of The Scofield Reference Bible, Authorized King James Version, Oxford University Press 1945. Inexplicably, and I assume intentionally, ALAH was excised from all subsequent editions of the King James Bible.By relying on the Qur'an to buttress his religious arguments, the author unwittingly indicates that the Qur'an, like the bible, is truth. Although his stated aim is to proselytize to Muslims and attempt to convert them to Christianity, I very much doubt that the book can successfully achieve that goal. Muslims can argue that the bible itself foretold the coming of Mohammed (Deut.18:18.).This book, despite its negative tone, can make a contribution to inter religious dialogue.

Inspired by the painting of old masters, his work has a life to it lacking in much art these days...That will be more effective than any words I write here at convincing you to rush right out and buy his book, or order it here from Amazon.com.If you are a fan of fantasy art done well, then this book should be in your collection."},{"Title":"Illumina: The Art of J.

This book might have been better if it contained the artwork alone however.The writer is not the artist and makes dozens of references to artwork which is difficult to reference because there are no page nos.associated with her descriptions or the art she's talking about isn't even in the book! There is also no index..so good luck. I hope Targete plans on a publish a new collection of his art soon as he is very prolific. Hopefully the next one will be better organized and self narrated."},{"Title":"Illumina: The Art of J. P. Targete","review":"Whether Sci-Fi or Fantasy, Targete's career demonstrates his unstoppable ability to remain versatile and evolve creatively as an artist--a very rare trait, even in this highly competitive industry.Targete's masterful use of various media is an added quality to this artist's expansive repertoire. You are not only inspired from the work itself, but also from obtaining an in-depth understanding of what it takes to get there by reading through his personal accounts. The drive and determination to remain committed and passionate about the craft is this award-wining artist's edge on the competition, and which coupled with his diversified talents makes him a true master in the field.Fans of Targete, and any art lover of the genres that may not be aware of his work, will find this book to be replete with large images and meaty text that make this book well worth the very small investment. The serious art book collector will recognize this as a must-have item to complement their library. No disappointments here."},{"Title":"Great Personal Statements for Law School","review":"Avoid this one at all costs. These personal statements are laughably bad, almost without exception. Treating them as models for your own law school personal statement isn't wise; these things read more like poor college admissions essays written by high school students. The writing is leaden and awkward, the subjects cliched, and the editing sloppy. Also, it's worth noting that most of the applicants whose essays are featured in the book gained admission only to mediocre law schools. A better choice is \\"Law School Essays that Made a Difference,\\" which features much stronger personal statements written by borderline applicants to top schools (Harvard, Columbia, Yale, Stanford, Chicago, etc.). The writers managed to gain entry to these sorts of schools, sometimes despite so-so numbers, because of their exceptional personal statements. The \\"Anna Ivey Guide\\" and Richard Montauk's \\"How To Get Into The Top Law Schools\\" also have good info about the personal statement. Or avoid the law school advice industry altogether and get a book like \\"The Art Of The Personal Essay,\\" an excellent anthology edited by Phillip Lopate; \\"The Best American Nonrequired Reading\\" series, edited by Dave Eggers; Natalie Goldberg's \\"Writing Down the Bones\\"; and Anne Lamott's \\"Bird by Bird.\\""},{"Title":"Great Personal Statements for Law School","review":"Paul's book is really helpful. If you aren't sure what personal experience to write about in your personal statment, Paul discusses how to choose what to write about, which is really useful. He also tells you how to write a good outline so that when you actually have to write the essay, it's not so hard.The advice on letter of recommendations is also very useful. Paul tells you how to choose the right recommenders and how to coach them so that your recommendations will really be an asset to your application.There are also many sample essays which I found very beneficial. For this alone, the book is worth it.I really recommend this book to anyone who's even thinking of applying to law school!"},{"Title":"Great Personal Statements for Law School","review":"A helpful book!

Although the book is tailored to prospective law students, I found almost all of the information just as applicable and relevant to my area of study, a Masters of Science in Mental Health Counseling! I can say, without any reservation whatsoever, that the tips, techniques, examples, templates, and just plain honest, down-to-earth advice Paul offered in his book is, by far, the highest contributing factor in my acceptance to Columbia, NYU, University of Rochester (whose Masters in Education program is a subset of the renowned Warner School of Education), SUNY Albany (whose PhD. program in clinical psychology was recently ranked #4 in the nation), the University of Vermont, and several State University of New York schools! Not only did I earn admission to a graduate program that is a perfect fit for me, but I was also awarded a graduate assistantship, which will cover over 75% of tuition for the 2-year program.

I bought and read this book a few years ago, and I recently came across it again in my collection of books and reaquainted myself with it by rereading it once more. Turned out to be as fresh and interesting the second time around as it was in the first.Ok on to what the book is actually about. In the Kabbalah of Envy the author explores the devasting effects of Envy, one of the 7 deadly sins. In wonderful anecdotes and stories Rabbi Bonder, illustrates just how envy pollutes the heart and clouds one's mind and soul.From his own words Rabbi Bonder quotes:\\"Envy, is a vampire who feeds not on his own vitality but on that of others.\\" Like anger, gossip, and negative emotions, it \\"pollutes the heart.\\" He gives words of wisdom and practical advice and spiritual exercises one can follow to purge and free yourself from the yoke of this terrible emotion, or at least to help lessen it's effects on your life and the effects of one's own envy in relation to those around him or her.This is a great book in learning about, and trying to cope with a emotion that can be twice as much destructive as pure hate alone and is responsible for so much discord and discontent in this world of ours it's not funny. You will be suprised to see yourself in many of the stories included here. The trick is not to be guilty or aghast about it, the trick is to do SOMETHING about it. A awesome book for one to help one's own self and hopefully others. You may never look at things the same again after this amazing book."},{"Title":"The Kabbalah of Envy: Transforming Hatred, Anger, and Other Negative Emotions","review":"This book continues in the long tradition of debate, storytelling, and conceptual discussions regarding how humans interact in the world, and how a \\"Jewish\\" perspective can be used in various situations that we all come across (I use the italics because as those who know Judaism, there is never one \\"right\\" answer and many aspects are up for lively debate!) The root of many of our troubles and enmity with others, according to Rabbi Bonder, is \\"envy\\" within our own souls is manifested as hatred, anger, gossip, slander, etc. The good thing about the book is that Rabbi Bonder does not tell us that these emotions are \\"wrong\\" per se but that if we take responsibility for our actions/energy from a spiritual stance, we must re-examine them. Appropriate use of anger, reproach, etc are discussed- how by all means it should be avoided with skillful interpersonal skills showing respect for another, but that sometimes anger and reproach are unavoidable. The book makes liberal use of stories, debates, and examples from sages, historical figures in Judaism, and real-life examples from today. Thought-provoking and intriguing."},{"Title":"The Kabbalah of Envy: Transforming Hatred, Anger, and Other Negative Emotions","review":"Although this book was often a little too abstract for me, it was nevertheless not completely useless. For example, I especially liked Bonder's treatment of difference. On the one hand, he emphasizes the value of being able to honor the differences that are part of nature. But at the same time, Bonder notes, rancor can arise from \\"a lack of sensitivity when expressing our differences in others\\"- a betrayal of harsh truths, or a tactless overemphasis on difference."},{"Title":"The Kabbalah of Envy: Transforming Hatred, Anger, and Other Negative Emotions","review":"Just whizzing through, looking to buy another copy, I want to leave words of thanks to the authors and encouragement to all who are considering acquiring it."},{"Title":"Brave deeds of Union soldiers, ([Brave deeds series])","review":"Can you imagine fighting a war against people you know and love in a place you travel everyday.

It is a moving chronicle that leads to the Thirteen Colonies, the Revolutionary War and closing the \\"Golden Door.\\"The next four sections tell the story of immigrants from every corner of the world, including the Armenians under \\"Freedom from Fear.\\" However, there are very few references to Turks or Turkish immigrants who started coming to America during the late 19th century and the early 20th century, which probably numbers around 300,000 today. Early comers were largely Ottoman citizens with different ethnic backgrounds and a few thousand Turks who first showed up, including those during the famous Chicago Worlds fair in 1890s, did not stay to become citizens. Most who came from the Ottoman lands are mentioned under \\"Muslims\\" (page 94) where immigration from the Islamic world is described as a fairly recent phenomenon in the United states, but with major cultural impact, perhaps numbering over 7 million. The reason given for the immigration from Syria and Lebanon, then parts of the Ottoman Empire, is young men seeking to avoid conscription into the Turkish Army.The Armenians have been given a special treatment with 2 pages presenting a brief history followed by what is referred to as \\"The Horrors of 1915\\", without mentioning the many Armenian uprisings in eastern Anatolia, some of which were probably organized by Armenians already settled in the United States long before the conflict started. The article begins with the following statement: \\"Many historians consider the fate of the Armenians during World war I to be the first European genocide of the 20th century. While the Turkish persecution of the Armenians remains controversial it led to an influx of up to 100,000 Armenians to America. Today, about half of the nation's million or so Armenian-Americans live in Califrnia.\\" The book needs to be revised referring to the death of both the Armenians and the Turks, not to a myhtical genocide.The last section \\"Freedom to Create\\" includes Eli Kazan under \\"Theater\\", referring to him as a Greek-American born in Turkey. The short biography of Kazan states that he won fame directing plays by Arthur Miller (such as The Death of a Salesman) and Tennessee Williams and acclaimed films such as \\"On the Waterfront\\", but Kazan's reputation among some of his peers was tarnished because he named names to the House Committee on Un-American activities during its hearing on communism in Hollywood in the early 1950s, which did not prevent him from receiving an Honorary Oscar for Lifetime achievement in 1999. He also wrote many books, including \\"The Anatolian\\", his life story. But the book does not mention Ahmet Ertegun, the legendary \\"Music man\\" who made many musicians famous, including Ray Charles, and died last year and was buried in Uskudar, Istanbul.In March 2006, PBS aired a documentary on the Armenian genocide, but refused the showing of another documentary, \\"The Armenian Revolt\\", which would expose the one sided treatment of the Armenian issue in \\"Destination America.\\" PBS, supposedly created for the good of public, is doing a disservice to the Turkish-Americans and the general public by disseminating false information, the way the Armenian issue is presented in this book being an example. What a shame.The book also has a wealth of information on the immigration and [...] .Yuksel OktayNew Jersey"},{"Title":"PBS: Destination America","review":"This book's greatest worth would be as kindling as energy prices continue their upward creep. To begin with, the Indians were NOT culturally American. They identified with their tribe and nation. The idea of an American polity was utterly alien to them until fairly recently. Blacks weren't able to maintain a distinct culture due to their bondage. Their culture was a synthesis of the Virginia Cavaliers (the slaveholding class, which this book only obliquely alludes to) and a few discreet folkways brought from Africa. A case in point: ebonics is actually the closest thing we have to the aristocratic speechways prevalent among the English aristocracy of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Regional accents are part and parcel of regional American cultures.This volume perpetuates the myth that there is one American culture that immigrants were expected to assimilate into. This myth gets the author in trouble, as lies tend to do. Because he begins white immigration around 1800, he passes right over the essence of American culture. America was actually culturally founded between 1620 and 1776 by four groups: the Puritans, the Quakers, the Virginia Cavaliers, and the Scots-Irish. Smaller ethnic groups of immigrants, as well as succeeding waves of immigration, adapted to one of these cultures depending on what region of the country they migrated to. These regional cultures frequently clashed in the past (e.g., the Civil War) and continue to manifest themselves today as the contest between \\"red\\" states (dominated by Scots-Irish and Cavalier cultures of the South) and \\"blue\\" states (dominated by Puritans and what remains of Quaker liberalism). All one has to do is to listen to the name-calling (yankee, elite, redneck, hillbilly, etc.) to realize the depths of the indigenous cultural antagonisms in America.Anybody interested in American culture would do well to forego this abominably bad work and instead opt for Fischer's \\"Albion's Seed.\\" Right now, Mr. Wills is only lying to himself.

It's well-written, engaging, told in a logical sequence, and it covers areas that other, similar books do not. It tends, however, to be a little over-corrective in its approach and minimizes the devastation of Viking violence on some more settled societies. He calls the raiding parties &quot;exuberant, at times destructive,&quot; making them sound more like Labrador Retriever puppies than sometimes murderous bands. Overall, though, it's a very good survey."},{"Title":"The Vikings in History","review":"F. Donald Logan's The Vikings in History seeks to establish that the overall picture we have of the vikings is distorted to the point that we do not consider their contributions to the development of Europe in the Middle Ages and early Renaissance periods. Logan wishes to move away from the traditional &quot;Franco-centric&quot; viewpoint which holds that it was the Carolingians who brought about the great changes to western civilization. For Logan, the Vikings instituted a great many of these changes, which resulted in the establishment of political, social and economic institutions which prevailed in western civilization for a fairly long time.Logan divides his book into several sections which deal with the vikings from a geographical perspective, treating groups separately, e.g. the Vikings in Ireland or the Vikings in England. This isolationist approach gives better perspectives on the individual movements of various Viking tribes and their accomplishments in the respective area.The book is not boring and is not bogged down with historical jargon or long explanations of historical methods and it reads extremely well. Some of Logan's discussions such as those on the value of the Vinland map work well for students of history as they would for people gathered at the dinner table. At the end of every chapter there is a short list of other works which the curious reader may wish to pursue.Some of Logan's conclusions may be questioned, especially when his ideas tear down traditional assumptions dealing with persons who have been revered for their accomplishments, such as King Alfred the Great.This book is a good read for any beginner student of the vikings. It is an easy read and it is informative. Students will appreciate Logan's employment of both archaeological and literary evidence for his supports."},{"Title":"Hayburner: A Gail McCarthy Mystery","review":"I always pre-order Laura Crum's books because I'm confident that they will be good and I haven't been disappointed yet.

Santa Cruz County Sheriff's Office Detective Jeri Ward immediately thinks inside job and suspects manager Bart Bishop of committing the crime to collect insurance money. However, two more stables are torched and a caretaker murdered making Bart no longer look like the culprit.Jeri still believes that \\"incest' has occurred as she strongly thinks that an insider is causing the fires. Horse veterinarian Gail McCarthy, who has been at each crime scene to help the horses, sees the thug that started the fourth fire, but she suffers a concussion and cannot recall whom she observed. Still the arsonist has apparently killed a human and several horses so Gail could easily be a target, as the culprit will not want her to remember and identify her/him.The seventh veterinary mystery, HAYBURNER, is a strong who-done-it that is at its best when Laura Crum portrays the anguish and pain of injured horses and the related veterinary scenes. The investigation plays second fiddle to the steeds and McCarthy's romantic seesaw. This mystery is more for animal lovers with a strong stomach as this tale makes stars of the steeds.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Hayburner: A Gail McCarthy Mystery","review":"I have read all of Laura Crum's books, and I think this is the best one yet.

For whatever reason ~ be it I'm just not the philosophical type, or I am just too new to Buddhism ~ much of what I read either confused me or bored me to death. I was greatly inspired by my early introduction to the Buddhist approach and was looking for practical ways to apply patience, kindness and compassion to my life. What I instead found were subjects way over the typical beginner's head and/or loooong explanations (man, can they beat a dead horse!) minus every day application.I was about to give up when I found this author. This book is the book I wish I had found a year ago, as it is informative as well as concise. Partner this book up with Franz Metcalf's enjoyable books on adding a little Buddhism to your life, and you'll have a great background plus some down-to-earth advice on how to start cultivating your Buddha Nature.So if you dig long, drawn out philosophical discussions on such matters, by all means...there are many respected authors out there.

Perhaps the combination of the narrator's British (?) accent with the author's straightforward approach did more for me than simply reading the book would have. The book lays out the essence of buddhism very well. I was fascinated to learn that a lot of the religious elements--the things one must accept on faith, like reincarnation--are pre-buddhist elements that one need not accept to benefit from the Buddha's teachings. She has certainly made me want to learn more.There were two helpful question and answer sections and a short but good list of further readings. I would have liked to hear a more down-to-earth and revealing explanation as to how the author came to buddhism and why she stuck with it.Her unreflective comments on Christianity bothered me. I find it interesting that, in a book whose main message is \\"I am responsible for my thoughts and reactions,\\" the author blames the lack of knowledgeable teachers for her own rejection of Catholicism. A second flaw is the false dichotomy between the buddhist version of faith and the Christian: according to Howley, Buddhists have faith because they have tried buddhism out. It is a faith based on experience. On the other hand, Christian faith (Howley would include Jewish, Muslim, and Hindu faith in this charge) is blind and based on no experience at all. Like most dichotomies, this is an oversimplification. To be fair, Howley did not come up with this dichotomy: it has appeared in several other books about buddhism that I have read.I recommend this book highly to anyone who wants to learn the basic tenets of buddhism from an interesting and honest teacher."},{"Title":"The Naked Buddha: A Practical Guide to the Buddha's Life and Teachings","review":"Buddha is the level/position of understanding engliment, not a person.Siddartha Gautam never said i am god, never talked about reincarnation or karma.

KARMA in this book is defined with a sentence \\"If I move a grain of sand, I change the universe.\\" which is define as if I change a grain of sand as a result other grain moves and then because of it the whole universe shifts little.

Howley strips away the various cultural accretions that make most strains of Buddhism confusing/contradictory to a novice, thereby laying bare the essence of true and original Buddhism.

If you want a simple (not simplistic) explanation of Buddhism, then this is the volume for you."},{"Title":"The Naked Buddha: A Practical Guide to the Buddha's Life and Teachings","review":"I would have rated this product higher if the price had been more reasonable. This audio book is only 5 hours long. For $40 I expected 10-12 hours of information.

It would be well worth about $15."},{"Title":"The Naked Buddha: A Practical Guide to the Buddha's Life and Teachings","review":"This book is an essential guide for those people who are beginning their journey into buddhism. It offers straightforward answers to questions about this religion. As a buddhist, I found this book to be a helpful meditation starting point when stuck on topics to ponder. Adrienne gives a brief background into the life of siddhartha so that the reader can understand how buddhism came about. Then she explores the buddha's teachings. I especially enjoyed the last two sections where she answers the readers questions about buddhism. I would definately recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Naked Buddha: A Practical Guide to the Buddha's Life and Teachings","review":"There is not much else that can be said about this book.

After starting numerous books about buddhism and being unable to finish them, I ran across this one on my itouch. The audiobook is incredible. It explains so much, without all the confusing terminology. She explains buddhism in laymens terms.

It is a bare bones buddhism. All the essentials without the mystery. No frills, no excitement, no nirvana. Dry and a little bit gloomy, it was not until the last chapters that some sunshine was offered that made me want to look further into buddhism and its life changing philosophy.It is a great book for those who have already decided to follow the path, as they will get a taste of what they may be in for. But if you are thinking about learning about buddhism and possibly incorporating buddhist philosophy and practices into your non-buddhist lifestyle this may not be your book.

Buy it if you like unicorns and magical creatures, it's as simple as that. Who doesn't like unicorns? Nobody, that's who."},{"Title":"Unicorns Coloring Book (Dover Coloring Books)","review":"I have bought several of these coloring books. I find that somehow little girls appear at my house with their mothers and, though, the mothers and I enjoy talking, the little girls (age 6-16) tend to become bored with adult conversation that is in no way related to their world. Usually, the girls are quite well mannered, but I \\"just know\\" they are bored out of their minds, so I go find a coloring book and crayons and send them into the dining room to color. Once there, they can use this coloring book as pathway back to their magical world and the mom and I can have our own boring adult conversation in peace.The book provides pictures to color, but also shows what countries believed in unicorns and what the unicorns looked like in the folklore of any given country. The pictures are large and easy for small ones to color, but frequently, the background features are very intricate and hold the interest of the older ones. I believe it has 32 pages.Some children color a page or two and leave with no attachment to the book. But most, over about age 8, become involved in the folklore and look at me imploringly when it is time to put up the crayons and the book. Once the crayons, I have all sorts, are safely put away, I usually let an imploring child take the book with her. I have lost 5 or 6 that way. I usually keep Unicorn Stickers on hand also.Unicorn Sticker - Tattoo It Laptop StickersorGlitter Unicorns Stickers (Dover Little Activity Books Stickers). If the child has been especially patient, she will also leave with a sticker book.The moms and I are generally engaged in setting up meetings, potlucks, or some get together which requires our concentration and which children find utterly boring. I can't think with the TV chattering away, so a coloring book and crayons provide something the child enjoys. Besides, my kitties cannot stand to have a stranger in the house without trying to explore the stranger. The dining room has cat trees in it, so coloring books AND curious kittens are generally together in that room. Makes for a contented child.I am very impressed with the history of Unicorns given in the book. The one lone 16 year old who arrived became fascinated by the lore and begged to have the book. She got it.I have used it as a stocking stuffer also. It is just a great book. I gave it only 4 stars because children who are younger than ten do not usually have the vocabulary to understand all the information given and I did originally buy it for a 5 year old. It was over her head and had only one rearing Unicorn which is what the younger ones really want...the pretty unicorns, not the historical ones. But, I use it often and generally have one tucked away. Since I can purchase three and receive four of these for the cost of three, it is really a great bargain for me! I do not suggest it for very young children who get frustrated if they cannot read the text themselves. Otherwise, it is suitable for children of all ages, including me. Dover makes nice informative, coloring books. No doubt you can find one on your favorite subject. I look for them in \\"Books.\\" Enjoy."},{"Title":"Unicorns Coloring Book (Dover Coloring Books)","review":"This even includes a double unicorn and a narwhal. Enough said.

The pictures are fairly detailed. My nine-year-old loved this book both for the variety of unicorns represented and for the information about each one. Gel pens are particularly useful in coloring the small spaces in several of the pictures. The book plus a set of the pens would make a nice gift. I would not recommend this book for the under six set due to the high level of detail in some of the pictures. However, this is the very reason older kids will love it."},{"Title":"Unicorns Coloring Book (Dover Coloring Books)","review":"I bought this for my daughters who are 4 and 6 and they enjoyed this coloring book. It is printed on nice heavy white paper and has nice illustrations. This book is geared for older children, but my daughters are very obsessed with coloring and did fine with it.

The picture and title are very misleading. Many of the pictures are of other animals with horns and none of them are the girly pretty pictures I was thinking when I handed it to my little daughter. I would say if the book is for someone into mythology and creatures this would be a good book but most of those children are older and don't like to color as much.

There are photos of half lion half deer with dragon scales and an antler for the horn. A horse/elephant/stag creature. An animal with a horn protruding out the forehead as well as out of the back of the head. There were sheep and dinosaurs as well.

After reading the book, I too felt that same love and compassion. With any of Telstar's work, 10% of it is words and 90% is energy. The energy of pure divine love. The book explains in layman's terms the way the &quot;fear&quot; energy, stops our natural courses of evolution and holds us back from doing what we came here to do. Anyone I have recommended the book to, no matter how closed their belief systems, say that it contains alot of &quot;common sense&quot;... however, until it is in our awareness's can we see &quot;fear&quot; for what it is and be able to overcome our own fears. The book communicates this much more than I ever could, which is why I highly recommend it to anyone who feels stuck, lost, or any amount of emptiness in their lives. Combine this with humour and genuine compassion, it is a soul searcher's answer to finding out who they really are underneath all of our programming. The process does not end with the book, it is ongoing and requires little physical effort to break free from the bars of denial of who we really are and what we came here to do. I can barely remember the frail, victim I once was before I first experienced this book. A must read!"},{"Title":"The Final Elimination of the Source of Fear","review":"I loved this book. My friend bought it at a library sale and we took turns reading it to each other at first as a joke because of its silly title.

I have grown to realize what fear is and it's not in my life much anymore. This book was a large component of making that come true.Its a good and simple read too. Very direct and no nonsense."},{"Title":"The Final Elimination of the Source of Fear","review":"I found this book to be one of the most profound sources of truth I have yet to read and experience. I believe if I had read this book when I was young I may not have experienced the truth and power of the words and feelings that I did now that I'm older. This is not to take away from anyone wishing to reading this book. In fact I would encourage any true seeker of truth to read it. You will experience a powerful expression of connectedness and maybe a clear understanding of your place in the universe.

It is either an insult to the reader, or totally incompetently produced, or both. It simply does not make sense, which is a pity because within it, there appears to be a serious collection of facts, however they are not presented coherently. The book commences by attempting to present the book as written by an 18th Century Adam Ferguson, who may or may not be an ancestor of the author, but the presentation is simply incoherent. (No, I did not reach the end to see whether there is any explanation.)The simplest problem to explain is spliced sentences. For example, here is a randomly selected quote: \\"... nor to commence hosti- keep them in subjection were sometimes in danlities until thev had demanded and had been re- ger of being lost.\\" If you cut and paste, and recognize that hostilities and danger are the linking words, you have two \\"sliced and diced\\" texts. Unfortunately, the problem is bigger than that, because you now have to put the sentences together, then you have to work out where they fit because at a higher level they also tend to be mixed up, and unfortunately not always at such obvious joints. There appears to be little or no text that does not have some such problem. Quite simply, no matter how much information is really in this book, you won't get it because it is impossible to read. Avoid at all costs."},{"Title":"Scene and Structure (Elements of Fiction Writing)","review":"Taking you from the very minute 'Stimulus and Response' through How to build a classic scene, How to twist the classic scene and finally ending with How to write a multi viewpoint book, Jack M. Bickham keeps as tight hold of you in this non fiction book as he teaches you how to keep a tight hold your readers. All prepublished and mamy published writers could improve their writing by reading this book and doing what it says to. Well done."},{"Title":"Scene and Structure (Elements of Fiction Writing)","review":"I just finished reading this book. I read the whole book carefully, then went back and re-read several chapters. I believe I understand what Mr. Bickham is trying to get across.I agree with the reviewers who accuse the author of presenting a formulaic, by-the-numbers prescription for writing, because that's exactly what he does. The idea that every scene must begin with a clear statement of goal and must end in a disaster is simply ludicrous. Even if by \\"disaster\\" Bickham means \\"setback,\\" his poor choice of word is symptomatic of his own prose style, which is simply dreadful. I thought Dan Brown was a poor wordsmith, but Bickham makes him seem like Shakespeare! Unfortunately 90% of his examples come from his own wretched novels, which makes for some very unpalatable reading.Still, the idea of scene plus sequel as a basic pattern in a genre novel is probably on the mark. Clearly many variants and deviations from this pattern are possible, and Bickham admits this, even offers some examples. But I think his book might be more useful as a tool for analyzing genre novels than as a blueprint for writing them. The author who follows Bickham's prescriptive formulae is bound to produce a stilted piece of work that very few would want to read. On the other hand, using Bickham's ideas for fine-tuning a scene or sequel might bear fruit. But beware pronouncements such as avoiding narrative summary or extended internalization within a scene.I am much more in tune with Stephen King's method of writing, in which the plot or structure of the novel evolves organically as it's written. Those who feel otherwise and are looking for a method of plotting a novel may turn to a book like this. But I would caution against plotting out every scene and sequel in advance, as Bickham advocates. If you know in advance every twist and turn the story is going to take, then where's the fun in writing it?"},{"Title":"Scene and Structure (Elements of Fiction Writing)","review":"An excellent book. Should be about your fifth or so book read on how to write, for the not quite so beginning beginner.When I read this I had already written about five or six chapters on my book. Some of the chapters were boring and seemed to be missing something. This book explained why.One theme of my prospective book is boy meets girl. One chapter was on how the guy has an idea to improve the dates the girl has. He tries his idea with her, and it works. Oh well, they go back home afterwords. Boring. To keep the interest of the reader the tension has to mount.Jack says you can violate his stated structure, it is just for starters or for a basic outline. That is you can go from scene to scene with no sequel between when things get tense. You can have the hero go from feelings to action during the sequel to show how strong the effect of the scene was on him. You can interrupt one scene with another, more intense unexpected one. Etc. This paragraph seems to be needed to be read by some critics of this book.In short. All authors should read this book and keep it in mind as they write. Rules are always meant to be broken, even Bickham's. To break a rule purposely knowing the rule but realizing your story needs to step into the \\"wild side\\" is fine, but to break a rule out of ignorance and place your readers (or worse, prospective editor) to sleep is not fine at all."},{"Title":"Scene and Structure (Elements of Fiction Writing)","review":"I haven't read a better book on the subject -- and I've read a ton of books on writing.

If organization and structure appear to be your main problems (or you suspect them of being so) then this is THE book the get.NOTE: I would rather give 4 1/2 stars than 4 (deduct 1/2 a star for the mismatched price with the narrow focus), but 5 would be misleading."},{"Title":"Scene and Structure (Elements of Fiction Writing)","review":"This book has it's ups and downs... it has tried and true, solid techniques... and it has some questionable advice that probably works best on Bickham's style of writing.I have read the negative reviews... and agree/disagree with their points about equally. I can only say from personal opinion that if you are an aspiring writer looking for a magic recipe for the perfect story, your heart is probably in the wrong place.I think in terms of Structure, Bickham hits the nail on the head. His explanation of scene and sequel is like a lightbulb atop the head of any individual that has not been formally trained in writing.I personally disagree with Bickham when it comes to each scene being required to have conflict, ending in a disaster, et cetera. Again, based on my reading of his works, that probably works well with his style of writing... but may not be 100% applicable for all genres, styles, plots, and authors.This book, I believe, is a must read. Despite its problems, it does get the brain spinning and thinking... and it's written from the perspective of an actual, published fiction author... not an author that writes only about writing, LOL.Remember, agree or disagree, these techniques apparently work... and apparently got Bickham published time after time.

If you want to write well, however, I would look elsewhere. The author is overly fond of his own work, which is normal, I suppose. But in my opinion, his own work is a good example of what NOT to do.The whole book could have--and should have--been edited down to one chapter. There is TOO much unusable information, bad advice, and repetition.The good information is simply the basic structure of scene-sequel, and cause and effect, with just a few other pointers, such as how to link scenes. But the good information is hiding amidst a lot of bad advice. Most of the rest should have been cut. It is too formula-oriented and will confuse the beginner. If the author's advice is followed, I suspect it will cause him/her to adopt a style which went out with the &quot;action-packed detective comics&quot; of the thirties and forties. This comes through loud and clear in his own writing, not to mention by his continuous use of &quot;your hero&quot; instead of &quot;the protagonist&quot;."},{"Title":"Scene and Structure (Elements of Fiction Writing)","review":"Scene & Structure is a useful read, even if you hate it. Disagreeing with Bickham's thriller writing style, with his disaster-in-every-scene, and his overall, nearly set in stone approach to telling a story will give you plenty of wonderful examples of exactly what NOT to do in your fiction if you dislike this work.If, on the other hand, you are looking for direction in your writing and lack any sort of structure whatsoever, reading this will also help. You will make sense of the typical flow of a story, most notably the parrying and jousting between scenes and sequels and get general (very, very general) plotting tips. Bickham's advice will give you a basic starting point to develop your work and eventually break his rules.

The common thread for the poor reviews of this book is that those reviewers did not comprehend all of the material in the book, or they had a pre-determined formula of how to write. I can also say with certainty, for a number of the reviews, the reviewer did not read the entire book.Bickham does not mince words, is not at all vague, and gives painstakingly specific advice based on years of teaching, and writing books that get published. Furthermore, the end of the book consists of several appendices of annotated published manuscripts which explicitly demonstrate the structure he describes. Believe me, he couldn't be more clear. As such, I also think this book is suitable as a first book on writing a novel.Indeed, if you only bought one book on how to write a novel, this one would do the trick."},{"Title":"Scene and Structure (Elements of Fiction Writing)","review":"Struggling with your writing?

But I also read the whole book. As my title of my rewiew says this book gives tips for writing scenes and sequels. You don't have to follow each step and use it as a formula. It should help you to notice weak points of your structure and where to improve your own writing. I love literary fiction, but many new writers tend to write sequels and scenes that have nothing to do with their story. It slows down the readers. After reading this book, I just keep more than a few things in mind to see where I can raise the stakes or make things harder for the protagonist. What questions I can raise in readers' minds? It gives you tips to help you hook readers and know where you went on a rabbit trail.Yes, the author writes suspense or thrillers. Not all writers write that way. I don't. Also, the writer have shown examples that fail DPOV for example. Now, writers are taught to involve readers so they can experience themselves the journey. The author used his own examples using summaries and passive voice. Restating the goal in each scene may sound repetive. Resist the urge to explain things alerady said. Readers will thank you.Anyway, this book was worth reading. I learned, and it answered some of the questions that I had. But be prepared that this book is a bit hard to read. It may help or hurt your creativity. It depends on you. Use what your heart tells you and leave the rest.

Scene is comprised of goal, conflict, disaster and in which the conflict is worked out via stimulus-internal reaction-response. After a scene comes the sequel in which the character emotionally and rationally selects a new goal.Other reviewers notwithstanding, this is not a write by the numbers book.

But for anyone who has written numerous chapters and realizes that something is wrong, this book will give much needed understanding."},{"Title":"Scene and Structure (Elements of Fiction Writing)","review":"I gave this book five stars since, although I agree with some critical reviews, this is nevertheless the most complete book on the subject of 'scene' that I have read. I simply only have to look at the page count of digital scan clippings I made from this edition, 25! and I know how much new and good material this book offered me!I found the explanation very useful on how you build up a scene, starting with simple cause and effect, extending this into the scene build-up of transition and sequel.There is simply too much in it to go into detail, but he explores all kinds of variations with scenes to give your story the maximum page-turning effect, by speeding it up, maximizing suspense, in other words: how to plot your story. I also found the list of common mistakes handy, since it came with fixes too.Ok, I have to admit it is sometimes dry and somehow hard to read. But maybe this is partly because it is a rather subtle and deep subject. I would like to recommend Plot and Structure by James Scott Bell as additional reading; it is easier to read, very good on plot, but it somehow delves less deep into the scene subject. It is therefore a good supplement to this title.Only one thing though: forget the author's (unfortunately often stated) remark \\"always let the POV character state the scene goal\\". This is nonsense, unless indeed you want to write 1930s detective stories, as one reviewer put it. We all know plenty of stories where the character does not yet know why he does what he does, or what he wants. Think of it otherwise: as a writer you should always know what the (unconscious or conscious) goal of the POV is!Conclusion: despite some hard reading, the book offers excellent coverage of the scene subject, and replace 'let the POV character state his goal in the scene' with 'know what you want the scene to do\\""},{"Title":"Scene and Structure (Elements of Fiction Writing)","review":"This book is great for helping you to understand how arcs work and the importance of story questions, how desired effects rely on causes and how scene-ending disasters can be used to hook readers, but in terms of structure, which is the main point, the author fails miserably. I've very rarely seen this used to this degree, yet the author insists that every scene that's not a sequel must have a clearly defined goal at the beginning of it and for that goal to not be met, and then this is followed up by a recap or contemplation in a sequel. When authors state the obvious and recap everything, it steals the potential for surprise and comes across very patronizing to readers, as though they're too stupid to get it. Maybe you don't want the reader to know what the scene goal is. Or maybe there is no goal.What about the tender moments, the discussions with friends, the homicide detective tucking her daughter in at night, the shopping addict going on THE spree that finally sends her into a tailspin, the cheating couple coming up with a new hot spot, the mom going off the war, again, the grandma passing away before the MC's eyes ... or getting brutally murdered. There may or may not be goals in these types of scenes, yet they breathe life into stories and give context, realism and depth.Stories go way beyond failed goals at every turn. They do. Fiction can be as goal-oriented or not as you want it to be. Literary fiction, for instance, tends to be more character driven and plot takes a back seat.If you have several books all following this pattern, over and over and over, people will tire of your work very quickly. This kind of rigid pattern would only works for a formulaic genres, maybe mystery, where a character is out to solve a crime, but generally, it just doesn't work. With this rigid structure, we would never have books like The Book Thief or The Help.There are some nuggets of awesomeness in this book and structure bones you should familiarize yourself with, but you shouldn't take everything in it to heart or it will destroy and stifle the world your trying to pen into existence."},{"Title":"Scene and Structure (Elements of Fiction Writing)","review":"I haven't finished this book yet but what I have read has steered me in an more confident direction. Some people don't like it's formulaic style but obviously there is more than one way to skin a cat. I'm a formula and spreadsheet kind of person. If I start a project and just let it happen... it will never happen. I've read so many writing books that advocate writing from the seat of your pants and what usually happens for me is that I get stuck on something and get frustrated and then drop it.I've learned that if you have a map, you get to where you're going easier and faster. So I like this brick by brick way of plotting and structuring a scene and a story. If you don't prescribe to this method then by all means look for something that will stroke your ego by telling you you're just great the way you are.The writing style is easy and laid back and it makes you feel like you're just chatting with another writer who is there to help you out."},{"Title":"Scene and Structure (Elements of Fiction Writing)","review":"For anyone out there who is trying to hone their craft or just getting started this boook is a must - DO NOT MISS- Since reading this my writing has changed tremendously and I have been writing for 10 years.

Of course the main point of it all is to keep the reader engaged and tell a good story. One does this by tailoring the tale to human psychology (at least modern reader psychology). He says readers are fascinated and threatened by significant change; they want a story to start with it and a story question of vital importance (Is there salvation? What will happen to America? Is the world going to end?) to the characters and thereby the reader, keeping the reader worried, with our question(s) answered at the end through a means that is plausible (logical cause / effect inside and outside characters in the story) and rewarding (which doesn't mean a happy ending if the story unfolds a bad one). He describes a classic structure of \\"scenes\\" with external action that could be watched on stage, followed by what he calls a \\"sequel\\", composed of internal character thought / consideration / conflict / emotion and decision leading to more external action of the next scene. How you manage their order effects the pace. A series of action scenes where your character responds to every new difficulty quickens the pace, while back-to-back internalizations slow it down. And the tools he provides span more than just writing books. The act of inserting a time constraint (a ticking time bomb, bad weather arriving any minute, the world's going to end soon unless...) can elevate the reader's tension (good) and ruin a movie (bad) when we know what the screen writer's up to. (The TV series \\"24\\" did this every week, all night long. While some of these tactics can be overused - as they are in pulp fiction - they don't hurt the serious literary piece either. If there's a message of value to deliver over and above mere entertainment, why not get the reader there with some intensity of interest, especially if you're going to take them on a long haul? The only negative to Brickham's instruction are his writing examples, at times mundane, poorly written and often trite as to make the point without enthusiasm. He admits this, but it reads like an excuse not to make the examples more interesting with a bit more effort. Tolerate this minor point and you'll get a much better idea of what writers do, how they do it and you could do yourself if your goal is to be an effective fiction writer."},{"Title":"Scene and Structure (Elements of Fiction Writing)","review":"Over the years I've read dozens of \\"how-to-write\\" books, and I consider Scene and Structure by Jack M. Bickham to be one of the most important. The first chapters include worthwhile information, but much of that material is also covered in other books. What sets Scene and Structure apart from others is Bickham's description of sequel and how, combined with scenes, they can be used to structure and control the pace of a novel. If you're a serious student of the craft of novel writing, I whole-heartedly encourage you to obtain a copy and study it.Bickham's descriptions of scenes and how to use them was helpful. But his breakdown of the mechanics of sequels was a revelation for me. This one chapter is worth the price of the entire book, and more.I was fortunate to have read Scene and Structure as I was drafting my first young-adult novel, The Brute. I incorporated scene-and-sequel structure into my writing of Cracks from the beginning of the writing process to the end. Some of my chapters are structured with easily recognizable scenes and sequels, but others are adaptations to fit the needs of the story, as suggested by Bickham.My target readers are accustomed to the pace of today's movies and computer games. With scenes and sequels as the building blocks, I have a chance to create an emotional rollercoaster that can hold the attention of even the most reluctant readers."},{"Title":"Scene and Structure (Elements of Fiction Writing)","review":"I reluctantly gave this book three stars, although my personal dislike of it tempted me to lower it to two. The reason it got three is because I think it could be very useful to a certain type of writer; unfortunately that type isn't me.If your goal is to write for mainstream popularity, especially suspense/thriller type novels, this book could be a very good guide to writing a publishable work.If you have a hard time \\"feeling\\" the story as you write it, and like a very broken-down, somewhat formulaic, logical approach to structure, you'll probably like this book.If you have a more intuitive grasp of storytelling, you might still find some of the information useful, as you analyze your scenes and see where you have unconsciously followed \\"classic\\" structure and where you have deviated from it (and it may give you some food for thought as to why you've deviated from it and if it works in the particular story you're trying to tell).But in general, I thought the book focused too much on writing a suspense novel to be that useful as a general \\"how-to\\" writer's book. Not everyone's goal is to write a book that the reader will want to get through as fast as possible. In the best novels I read, I frequently stop and reread passages that are too beautifully written not to savor; style of prose and characterization are the main attractions to me. There must be something to be said about the structure of novels that don't simply follow the pattern of one disaster after another!Furthermore, I found the author's credibility strained with dogmatic statements such as \\"One viewpoint must clearly dominate in your manuscript...if you start spreading the viewpoint too evenly around in the story, the reader will not only fail to identify as strongly as we wish, he will also tend to get mixed up about which of the viewpoint character's goals is the one he is supposed to worry about most.\\" Ever read George R.R. Martin's \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" series? I can think of a number of different novels, from different genres, right off the top of my head that don't follow this rule. And the readers are intelligent enough to stay engaged in the story and care about a number of goals. The book is filled with such \\"rules\\" that made me think, \\"But wait, what about...?\\"The biggest technical failing in my opinion regards the clarity of the book. It occurred to me about 50 pages into the book that Bickham has a very specific idea of what constitutes a \\"scene\\", for example, but it was unclear to me what that was. When he starts talking later about scenes within scenes, this became even more obvious. For example, if you are writing a scenario in which two characters are engaged in a dialogue, and then a third character comes into the room and butts in, and the conversation resumes with the three characters talking, this may constitute a \\"scene-within-a-scene\\", according to Bickham. But my natural inclination would be to see it as one single scene. The distinction of where one scene ends and another begins is very important to understand if you are to follow the logic of his structuring. So I paged back to where he first talks about scenes, to see how he defines a \\"scene,\\" but did not find this question addressed. If it was addressed somewhere, it either wasn't very clear or there wasn't enough attention called to it.Some of the information seemed obvious - like not having completely illogical or irrelevant events sidetrack the story. Other information seemed like it could be important, but wasn't as clear as it could be due to use of undefined terminology.Nevertheless, I did find some generally useful tidbits buried within the book, particularly in chapters 7-10."},{"Title":"Scene and Structure (Elements of Fiction Writing)","review":"This is among the best books on craft you can buy. It explains the most important aspect of writing--scenes, and how to arrange them. Well worth the money."},{"Title":"Scene and Structure (Elements of Fiction Writing)","review":"Jack Bickham sold more than eighty novels in his career. Face it, the guy knew how to create story. However, in order to begin writing scene and sequel in the manner he advocates, you will need to change the way you think. It's about discipline. Not everyone is able - or willing - to discipline themselves. Few things we attempt in writing will be harder to accomplish than this - but as you will see a bit later, the reward for success could well be publication.I admit to being hardheaded, so it took a while for me. After I read and rejected his ideas I found them sneaking into my work anyway; a strong surprise right at chapter end - God, that worked great; a clear objective in mind at chapter beginning - readers came aboard in sentence one. Once you become able to see them, the principles of Scene and Structure not only make sense, they work better than anything else out there. First though, you'll need to make the change I mentioned in the opening paragraph. Don't be like me, you'll only delay your own success.Now, here's the testimonial part of the review. This happened after I restructured my own novel, which I originally created in 1999 and had been fiddling with forever. Frank Weimann, whose office has handled over thirty bestsellers in the last five years, contacted me - cold - after reading my new chapter one (posted at novelpro.com). He asked if I would be interested in having his office represent me. The proposal from Kunati Book Publishers and my first publishing contract followed. THAT's how powerful Jack Bickham's concepts are.There's a saying - my mother loved applying it to me; \\"You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink.\\" Here's my advice.

This statement is true, of course. It has to be. It's a tautology. \\"Structure\\" and \\"organized\\" are synonyms. This sentence would be okay, if it were clarified by what follows. It isn't. Every sentence is equally vague. \\"Structure is a process.\\" Wow! Would a statement like that raise some eyebrows on the people who have spent a lifetime thinking about structure and thinking about process!Even the discussion of scenes gives very bad advice. \\"What is the pattern of a scene? ... Statement of goal. Introduction and development of conflict. Failure of the character to reach his goal.\\"(p.23) Anyone who writes scenes like this will have a slow, plodding novel. Novel writers can learn a lot about scenes from watching movies. And from reading books on screenwriting.Finally, some feel that you should worry about structure AFTER you've written your novel. This is very bad advice (except perhaps for people who have trouble getting anything down on paper at all). Structure should be done before the first draft. Otherwise, the seduction of the prose (one's own sacred prose) will prevent you from ever getting your novel into shape. Besides, designing a novel can itself be a creative process. It doesn't all have to be in the line-level writing. Of course, if you're writing academic-literary fiction, then it doesn't matter. The worse the structure, the better. But for most writers, creating a good structure will make writing the first draft easier, not harder. And you can--and should--always be willing to change the structure on the fly when a great idea comes along!"},{"Title":"Scene and Structure (Elements of Fiction Writing)","review":"Whow, there's been a lot of different ratings on this book - but I don't doubt.

If you wan't your readers to keep turning pages after midnight, this gives you great pointers. I edited my novel one last time (after I thought I was finished) and it made it so much better with Bickham's advice. This is definitely worth the time and money!"},{"Title":"Scene and Structure (Elements of Fiction Writing)","review":"I picked up Scene & Structure, despite misgivings about the author, because I enjoyed Characterization & Viewpoint (Orson Scott Card) and Beginnings, Middles and Ends (Nancy Kress). These books were a rich vein from which to draw for writers of any age or experience level. I still reread Card's entry at least once every five or six months, to ensure I'm getting the most out of his tips. Bickham's work in Scene & Structure has given me questions about buying any other books in Elements of Fiction Writing, however.There are a lot of problems with the book. To begin with, Bickham uses a variety of bits of terminology that are, at the least, odd. Ordering readers to have a \\"disaster at the end of every scene\\", and to \\"use sequels to bridge the gap between two scenes\\" is a bit problematic when you haven't described what a \\"sequel\\" or \\"disaster\\" constitutes.Perhaps you noticed I used the term \\"ordering\\" up there; that's another issue. Bickham writes like a sledgehammer, or perhaps a drill sergeant. There is no room for variation in his mind, and any deviations from his rules which he even acknowledges he discards as \\"not recommended\\".The problem isn't that Bickham isn't skilled at what he does; he writes fiction in the style of Dan Brown or Robert Ludlum and does it better than Brown or Ludlum generally do. But it's thriller style writing and his rules aren't remotely applicable to any other genre, much less literary writers."},{"Title":"Scene and Structure (Elements of Fiction Writing)","review":"This is definitely not my favorite book in the series. Like other reviewers, I thoroughly enjoyed Character & Viewpoint, and I was looking forward to this book. I felt I had a lot to learn, but this book fell far short of my expectations.While I'm not entirely against the points Bickham makes throughout, I found myself resenting the iron-clad way in which he depicted the structure of a story. Another reviewer compared Bickham to a drill sergeant, and I tend to agree. Nowhere in the entire book does he clarify that these are suggestions. Like mastering grammar, you must know the rules in order to break them. However, Bickham clearly states than breaking these rules--his rules--is tantamout to author failure. Perhaps his unbendable rules are applicable to certain genres, but Bickham never qualifies his statements, which I assumed he intended were to be followed across the board.Moreover, the examples he uses throughout, both of his published fiction and in-chapter creations, are outrageous. I certainly don't aspire to write like him, not only just in terms of genre, but in every aspect--so I'm highly disappointed in this book. If every book I ever read were set up with the immutable structure depicted by Bickham, I'd long have given up reading entirely. Sometimes the mystery of a character's motives are what pulls you through, rather than an up-front statement of their \\"scene goal\\". Sometimes the characters don't know what they're after. In Bickham's explanation, there is no room for such ambiguity and sublety.I still give it three stars, though, because there are insights to be gleaned, if you take everything with a grain of salt and make sure to temper his lessons with lessons you've learned through your own reading and writing.

Also, the author's corny references to himself (such as regretting his age) are silly and misplaced. I didn't buy this book for a bunch of laughs, but to get serious help.

I had heard this was the next best book in the series, and if that is the case, then I won't be reading any more of them.Though the author asserts a few times that none of his rules is hard and fast, these assertions fall flat in the face of his constant emphasis of those rules. Much of the book sets up the idea that every scene (he says **every** scene) must begin with a goal for the protagonist, involve conflict, and end in disaster. Perhaps if you are writing a dime-a-dozen thriller then this is a good formula to go with, but I find this idea as dull as this book. His examples are cliche, the exercises are lame, and overall I took almost nothing worthwhile from this book. The only bit I did appreciate was the short time he spent discussing action-reaction and not dropping the stimulus-response aspects in fast paced scenes.To be fair, if you want to write a court room thriller that we've all seen before, but in a slightly different way, then this book will help you to do that. Sadly, that's about as far as it goes. If you want to write fresh stories, especially if they focus more on characters, milieu or ideas, then don't waste your time with this book.

If you go in for graphic design, you'd better know how to use concepts such as contrast, repetition, proximity and alignment. And if you go in for fiction-writing, you'd better be able to use concepts such as scene, sequel, conflict, stimulus-response, and so on.You might have a layman's understanding of what a scene is, but from the writer's standpoint, exactly what is a scene? What is its purpose? What work does it do in the overall structure of a story? What are its elements? What sorts of variation are possible? How do you control the pace of a scene? How do you effectively connect one scene with another?These are the kinds of questions Bickham answers in useful detail and with comprehensible illustrations. If the excerpts from his own writing in the appendices aren't masterpieces, as some reviewers complain, they do serve to illustrate specific principles and techniques discussed in the text, and these are what make the book worth studying. To mention just one example, before encountering this book I had never grasped -- never even heard of -- the distinction between a scene and a sequel. Yet it's an essential distinction that a fiction-writer must know how to use. Bickham tells you, shows you, how to use it -- and many, many others.Bear Bryant was no Joe Namath. Bob Fosse was no Fred Astaire. The best coaches and teachers are rarely top-notch practitioners of their arts. Jack Bickham is no Charles Dickens, granted. But he is an insightful teacher whose book can be of value to any writer who approaches it as a source of instruction rather than a model of artistic excellence. And as for \\"rules\\" about ending every scene with a disaster or explicitly stating the goal of every acene, if these strike you as wrong, vary them. If you aren't creative enough to think of exceptions to an \\"all or nothing\\" rule, are you really creative enough to write fiction?"},{"Title":"Scene and Structure (Elements of Fiction Writing)","review":"This is the third &quot;Elements of Fiction Writing&quot; book that I've read. The previous two (&quot;Characters and Viewpoint&quot; , and &quot;Beginnings, Middles, and Ends&quot;) are truly excellent, and I have no hesitation in recommending them as both readable and usable.Unfortunately, this work falls far short of the standards set by the previous two books.Here's an example of Bickham's writing, excerpted from one of his novels and presented in this book as an example to be emulated:&quot;A sound like air gun pellets loudly peppered the front wall of his cabin.&quot;In my world, air gun pellets might pepper a wall, but a sound cannot. Perhaps that's just his style? If pulling the reader up short and making him say &quot;huh?&quot; is style, then fine - but personally, I'd expect his examples to be cleaner than this.As for the assertion that every scene must end with a disaster (OK, he means setback perhaps, but disaster is the term he uses), once again: huh? I've carefully checked several popular novels on my shelves - the sort of work I'd be proud to write - and it just ain't so. That's not to say I've never read novels that follow that formula to a large degree, but they've been just that: formulaic. Perhaps there's money to be made down that road, perhaps it's a way to get published, but it's not for me.He actually goes further than that. Every scene must begin with a clear statement of goal (\\"most of the time, the character states his immediate goal in obvious, unmistakable fashion\\"), to be followed by development of conflict, and finalised by failure to reach the goal. Then there must be sequel - again precisely structured (Emotion, Thought, Decision, Action).I also found the writing style problematic. The two books I mentioned above were fascinating and engaging, and I finished each in a day or two, but this one is a slog.As you can probably tell, I'm irritated with this book. If it was a case of Bickham offering guidelines, it would be one thing... but he's implying that this has to be the rule, and that exceptions must be carefully justified. (\\"Once every hundred scenes, maybe you can get away with allowing the goal to be implicit\\"). Perhaps that's appropriate for particular genres, but few of the (mainstream) writers whom I admire follow these recipes."},{"Title":"Scene and Structure (Elements of Fiction Writing)","review":"Most books on fiction writing aren't worth the paper they're printed on.

I don't like to accept criticism without seeing something for myself so I approached it with an open mind.I found very quickly that I wanted to disagree with the statements made in the book. Later I decided it was because a large part of the book is dedicated to how to tell a story rather than how to write one. Overall it was not a very pleasant experience though I did learn some things and make my mind up about others. The question which made me want to by the book was answered, so I suppose I got what I needed from it.The good points of the book. His approach is very structured, logical, and easy to remember without having to refer to the book. The topics of scene and structure get all of the attention of the book, as I recall. He shows how scenes build together to form the structure of a book rather than treating them as unrelated topics.The bad points of the book. He begins early on by doing two things that bothered me: assigning a lot of negative characteristics to readers and his use of the word \\"disaster\\" (an exaggeration repeated scores of times). His approach to scenes felt very artificial to me. Despite what the book claims, this approach is NOT good for multiple viewpoint characters or even multiple main characters. Nor is it very flexible (the viewpoint problem being an example).I wanted to put the book down at a few places. He cited his spy novels several times in the book, and everything in the book felt geared towards telling that kind of story. I also don't think that books need to be simple to read and follow only because readers are a bunch of TV-addicted apes that can't go five pages without being reminded what is happening in the overall story.One of the premises of the book is that a story should keep the reader on the edge of his seat the entire time, never knowing what is going to happen next. That is definitely a good way to tell some stories, but to do it as general principle seems abusive of the reader. Orson Scott Card, in \\"Character and Viewpoint\\" (a must-buy), said that tension comes not from things suddenly happening out of nowhere but from the reader being aware of the probability of something happening within the story. In Mr. Bickham's method the reader is aware something will probably happen because they are being hit with a new crisis and \\"disaster\\" every single scene. In other words, it uses a kind of artificial tension.Mr. Bickham says that the worst thing that could happen is that someone would put the book down and not pick it up again. In my opinion the worst would be for someone to finish the book just to find out what happens and not have enjoyed it. Mr. Bickham gears most of Scene and Structure towards keeping the book in peoples' hands until the end.Judging from the quotes from his novels, I won't be picking any of them up any time soon. I don't find covert CIA agents who work a second job as famous international tennis stars very credible. It is also poorly written based on every other source I have read.As I said I really didn't enjoy the book but found myself accepting a lot of things as valid or at least insightful and usable. I also think his bad reviews come largely from the first few pages, where some of us (me included) took the condescending remarks about readers personally.If you want to look into the method a published author uses of building scenes and structuring them together, get the book. If you will only accept flexible advice or a method that doesn't rely on artificial tension, then don't get it."},{"Title":"Scene and Structure (Elements of Fiction Writing)","review":"I have used this book to teach plotting to creative writing students, so my review is based on how well absolute novice writers respond to the ideas he puts forth in this book. On the whole, they respond positively. Once they grasp the standard three-act structure of a plot, they find his scene-sequel formula to be IMMENSELY helpful figuring out how to work out options for rising action. A few students complain that they don't like being taught a *formula*, and it seems a few reviewers have that gripe as well.I'll say here what I say in class. First, if a formula happens to have been successful (as you can see if you break down almost any movie or popular novel), eh, maybe just this once it might be worth your time to learn it. Just file it away somewhere or something. Second, just because Bickham advocates a linear tic-tock scene-sequel way of composing your plot, that does not mean, nor does Bickham anywhere say, that you have to TELL the story in simple lockstep straightforward chronology. Once you have the basic idea of what's going to happen and why, you can start the story whenever you darn well please. You can start just at the climax, if you want, and tell the story through disconnected flashbacks, so that readers have to piece together the shards into the picture of the story arc. You can tell the story as an epistolary novel. You can tell it by varied protagonists. The only limit is imagination of the author. If you hate this book because you can't figure out new and creative ways to apply his basic formula, that doesn't necessarily equate with the *book* being worthless.My students are grateful because (and remember they're all fledgling writers) this book's ideas give them handles to grasp when they sit down to write. I don't advocate the whole 'scene goal clearly stated to the reader' thing Bickham states, but if you as the WRITER have no idea what the scene goal is, or how things are going to wind up worse for the protagonist, chances are pretty high there will be a high Flounder Quotient in your plotting. All in all, it's worth your time and money as long as you are willing to view it as a plotting aid device and not the Magic Potion of Writing. It's a skeleton upon which one can reliably hang decent stories: my students are invariably impressed at the end of the semester both at their own ingenuity in storytelling and how they managed to create a story that *moves* and unfolds logically."},{"Title":"Scene and Structure (Elements of Fiction Writing)","review":"Bickham was Dwight Swain's student at Oklahoma and went on to write a lot of (I think) pot boilers using what he learned, then wrote Scene & Structure.

Each chapter has a clearly defined purpose, the pace is much better, and it has helped me to see what needed to be deleted. I have read it a few times and have found it a MUST HAVEI tested the scene structure by reviewing a couple of movies I have on DVD (my books were in storage, so it was easier to look at themovie version. I picked 2 totally diferent movies)1) Gone with the wind. Each scene ended with scarlett feeling something she didn't want to feel (disaster).1st she finds out that wilkes is to marry someone else. she's upset.2nd their hand is having an affair and the child is dead. the man is stunned3rd she goes to the party and sees wilkes and melonie together. she frowns sadly.4th she tells him she love hims and he says he's going to marry melonie. Why because Melonie's like him.she's angry5th she sees melonie and wilkes kissing so she agrees to marry charles. getting even.6th charles dies, scarlett should be happy but she has tp pretend to be widow. She's trapped in southern ways of ettiquette, stuck wearing black until whenever...etc....2)Hunt for Red October1st connery outside sub, you know something serious is going to happen2nd the american sub hears the noise and recognizes it as machinery. The scene ends with them hearing it again and getting ready to track it. feeling of nervousness...3rd connery kills and burns paper w/his assignment.4th baldwin learns that the russians have a silent prop. Fear... AND the russians get the letter of defection. Shock/fear...5th Baldwin in a meeting finds out he is expendable and has to go to sub. anxiety/fear/unsure6th Baldwin is air sick and has to get to sub.

The disaster can be anything that makes the characters uneasy or feel anything negative fear, uncertainty, anxiety, anger, dispair etc..

It just means the situation is not reasolved AND either additional problems arise or a solution gets burned at the end of each scene."},{"Title":"Scene and Structure (Elements of Fiction Writing)","review":"In Scene and Structure Bickham says that, to propel a story forward, every scene must end in disaster. By &quot;disaster&quot; he doesn't mean natural disasters or brutal deaths, but that the viewpoint character should have his attempt to pursue a goal thwarted again and again until his desperation pushes him to risk everything in a final attempt. At first, this seems simplistic, and it doesn't describe all stories, but reading this book raised my awareness of what makes some stories compelling while others seem diffuse and uninvolving.Bickham also dwells on the aftermath of every confrontational scene and, in laying out the total pattern, provides the most useful analysis of story I've yet seen."},{"Title":"Scene and Structure (Elements of Fiction Writing)","review":"Although I give Jack Bickham credit for attempting to write a book on structure and scene, as a novelist and writing coach, I can't say that he succeeded. There are some excellent nuggets and some good teaching but, unfortunately, I felt that most of that was lost beneath the mountain of information and somewhat dogmatic writing. Given this, I think that any beginner or even someone who does not have a strong sense of self as a writer who reads this could be overwhelmed by all the information and tone. I myself felt that I was back in college and studying for a course.The book is far too linear and lacking in the passion that motiviates one to take chances, which is what fiction writing demands. If a writer tried to follow everything he says, she might get hopelessly lost and end up feeling inept, which is the perfect time for the Inner Critic to step in. Then you start thinking things like, \\"I can't follow this... I'll never be able to write... I might as well clean the bathroom.\\"To my way of thinking, structure, which is very difficult to explain in the abstract, is also one of the last aspects of putting together a book with which a writer needs to concern himself. It's too intellectual, too heady, too linear to deal with early on. Doing so can actually undermine the creative process. However, what is the right time to start thinking structure is very individual. When I am beginning a book, I don't think in terms of chapters or parts for months. I think in terms of characters and write scenes -- whatever comes to mind -- from different (and emerging) characters' points of view. What's important is finding your character's voice, story, history, motiviation, angst -- whatever. Structuring comes once you feel the character is alive and talking. Then I begin to think about an possible opening chapters. The first structure I apply is that of scenes growing in chapters that have the \\"possiblity\\" of taking on the story line. I say \\"possiblity\\" because in the early stages of a novel, anything is up for grabs and almost always changes. So what I think is chapter one, if it even exists in a final draft, is often a chapter or scene a third to half-way through the novel. A novel is organic, not static and any stucture must be elastic enough to support this organic nature.That said, I believe that structure exists in a very pure form somewhere in the writer's unconscious and that if she does her job, opens to the passion and voice of the character and tells the best story she can tell, that structure emerges when it is time. This is not fancy, actually, but a fact I have seen happen countless times with my own books and those of my students. The problem is that it's hard to see structure if you don't know what you're looking for. And if you don't know, then it's best to trust the intuition of your Inner Writer or, if you're a beginner or even intermediate writer, find a coach or take a course with someone who can help you. Remember, each book is different. There's no one size fits all structure.Scene is a different matter completely. I agree with Jack Bickman that scenes are the building blocks of novel and done well, they add to the pacing of a book. A great way to get an intuitive hit on writing scenes is to watch a movie -- one you have seen before and think is well done -- and watch it for its movement from scene to scene. In a movie, scenes actually build one on top of the other and they come together to make the whole. The same is true of novels. The scenes build one on top of the other and through them we see characters and experience story line. Remember the old adage, \\"show don't tell.\\" A well done scene always shows because it is driven by the voice of the point of view character who is living in the moment of the scene with all his emotions, needs as well as the necessary interactions and dramatic action that is integral to the scene.I have broken down the scene into 5 very simple parts, which I believe are all you need to know about creating scenes. As you grow as a writer, you ability to work with these five ingredients grows -- you begin to bring in expereince, talent and writing not only as craft but art.The five ingredients of the ccene in fiction writing that I think are important are:1. point of view: who's story are you telling2. dialogue3. flashback (may or may not come into play)4. mood (I'd rather say mood than description.)5. Dramatic tensionAny book on writing, I believe, needs to be experiential not didactic. As writers, we need to have passion and hands on experience always working along with an discussion of technique."},{"Title":"Scene and Structure (Elements of Fiction Writing)","review":"The reading makes for tough and tedious going at some points, but the info is well worth the dig.

One particular book intrigued me enough to check out the author on the web. I was surprised to find out he wrote over 75 books, and is the author of a childhood movie I saw, The Apple Dumpling Gang. Even more intrigued, I dug deeper and was saddened to find that he is no longer living.All in all, I would suggest this book to any struggling and or new writer.I also plan on purchasing one of his novels that was reference in the book, Katie, Kelly, and Heck."},{"Title":"Scene and Structure (Elements of Fiction Writing)","review":"Another reviewer said reading this book was \\"a slog.\\" I had to think whether I wanted to agree with that description or not.

As Bickham himself wrote, understanding structure frees the writer. Once you understand structure, then you can decide when and how to break the rules.According to Bickham, novels are made up of scenes, in which there must be conflict; transitions; and sequels, in which the viewpoint character reacts to conflict and determines a new course of action.The protagonist is the author of her fate; whatever happens at the end of the book is a result of decisions, she has made. An ending doesn't have to be happy, but it has to be satisfying; it has to answer the story question posed at the beginning of the book.Reading a good book on craft is very encouraging for the struggling writer and this is a great book on craft.The reviewer of the title \\"Melodramatic Crap\\" needs to edit his comments; the spelling errors detract from his message... among other things."},{"Title":"Scene and Structure (Elements of Fiction Writing)","review":"I was stuck on three different stories, each of which I'd thought were completed.

So I sat in the tub with a $6 used paperback of Scene & Structure, hoping it might get me thinking about the stories in a different way.The solution to one of my stories was right there on the second page, and elaborated on on the sixth. The book helped a lot with the second story as well. I'd been doing so well with my artsy stories that I'd gotten into the habit of ignoring the basics of structure.HOWEVER. Jack Bickham is a terrible writer. If you follow his advice to the letter, you'll write terrible, derivative pot-boilers like he did.Bickham knows that rules aren't absolute. He often gives examples of when and why to break the rules. But even when he breaks the rules, he does it as a matter of craft, not art. Craft is how to make a story better. Art is making a set of story trade-offs that cooperatively make a story better for a particular audience or for a particular purpose. Bickham has loads of craft, but no art.You should memorize and internalize the story structure principles Bickham describes, so that you don't even have to think about them--if you sleepwalk to your desk at night and start writing, a Bickham story should come out. Art is knowing when and how to deviate from that structure.

Lots of examples are given for how to build tension in scenes, how to improve boring scenes, how to create scene primarily with dialogue and ones primarily of prose.As far as the structure suggested, it goes into building the most simple, linear structure, to more complex scene-within-a-scene structures, and even recommends good places to insert things like flashbacks and how to make them work without slowing the pace of the story down.Highly recommended, has been an incredibly inspirational tool and is easily referenced back to if you need a quick refresher."},{"Title":"Scene and Structure (Elements of Fiction Writing)","review":"This book gives it to you straight up from the stimulus-response of each sentence to the scene-sequel of each section of your work.

It depends on where you are as a writer and what your strengths and weaknesses are. My writing seems most creative when not following structure, a few scenes here and there, until a strong enough idea develops. At this point I need to start thinking about structure before I continue. I work out the general ideas for the Beginning, middle, and end until I have a one page synopsis. In the next step I work on the characters as much as possible, this is where my primary ideas for plotting the story comes in - through the characters. I expand on the synopsis until I have a more detailed roadmap with room for creativity. This is where I begin to think about scenes, and Jack M. Bickham gives you the best questions to ask about your scene and what to employ into it. This book has improved the way my mind structures the scene internally and thus my scenes are much clearer and focused. It is not a matter of following his steps implicitly, but using his ideas when writing your scene. This book has more gold nuggets than any other book I have read for scene structure. Just take a look at the dedication page to Dwight V. Swain, another great book. I only wish I had Dwight's book when I started writing in the 1980's and I wish I knew about Jack M.

I was writing a high-class novel. But, unfortunately, my novel had a problem. The other novels from my critique group had the same problem. There was a lot of great material in our novels, but there was no reason for our readers to keep on reading. Now, only a couple of us were trying to build page-turners. I certainly wasn't. But I had to admit, my reader had no reason to read chapter two after reading chapter one, paragraph two after paragraph one, or sentence two after sentence one. I figured that could not be good. What Jack Bickham taught me in this book is simply how to string my words together in the most straightforward possible fashion so that my reader has a reason to go on reading. Bickham isn't teaching style, plot, or genre. He is describing a way to give your writing forward motion. It can be a furious forward motion, or gentle, that's up to you. You can write high literature this way, or pulp, whatever you want. What is Bickham's secret? The linear narrative, a story built on a straight line, a chain of cause-and-effect. No flashbacks. No shifts of viewpoint. His tone is modest. He admits that there are other ways, maybe better ways, to structure a story, but he is not teaching those ways.

He continues with instruction on building these into a novel.Bickham's two-step is rather repetetive and uninteresting, and will produce the same sort of book. Characters aren't really important here; in fact, you can't do much of anything cognitive except the sequel, which is reserved for recovering from the last scene and planning for the next one. If you take Bickham's advice to heart, you'll write the kind of paperback pot-boilers that people buy in airports and forget more quickly than they read them. Sure, the disasters can be emotional; in that case, you get the kind of melodrama that fills stuff like your average trashy romance novel.

It would be extremely difficult to pull this off legitimately."},{"Title":"The Loathsome Library: A Box of Unfortunate Events, Books 1-6 (The Bad Beginning; The Reptile Room; The Wide Window; The Miserable Mill; The Austere Academy; The Ersatz Elevator)","review":"When I first started reading this series of books I was set back a little because these stories are not written in the style of typical children's books. These stories are dark, and the evil characters are truly evil. A number of reviewers have panned this series because they are dark, and because they often push the boundaries of what some of us may find acceptable for children to read. It is because of the dark imagery that I have typically recommended that age 9 be a minimum age. Some children may be unprepared for these books until later.In the first three books in this series we learn that the three Baudelaire children, Sunny, the baby, Klaus, her brother, and Violet, a young teen, have lost their parents in a terrible fire. The children are sent to live with their evil uncle Olaf, who has ulterior motives yet to be revealed in later books. The children quickly learn how evil he is, and ultimately escape. They next go to live with their uncle Montgomery Montgomery in \\"The Reptile Room,\\" only to be forced to move on again. In \\"The Wide Window\\" the children live with an aunt who is afraid of everything, only to ultimately be forced to move on again, continually chased by the evil Count Olaf in a variety of disguises.In \\"The Miserable Mill\\" the Baudelaire orphans have moved to another relative, this one the owner of the Lucky Smells Lumbermill in the rundown town of Paltryville. The children toil in the lumber mill from the time they arrive in Paltryville. Soon they have splinters and are tired and hungry, because they get nothing for breakfast, almost nothing for lunch, and casserole for dinner. There are multiple labor and child abuse laws violated in this book, but perhaps it might make some readers more appreciative of what they have.As has happened in the previous three books, the children are able, principally through their own efforts, to overcome the bad guys. Once again the children are on their way to another home.Of the four books thus far, this one was my least favorite. The style of the books is such that bad things happen to these children on a regular basis, but in this book it seems as though bad things are happening to nearly everyone. This book is very depressing. I was also a bit annoyed with the extremes that the author went to in his exaggerations.The fifth book in the saga implements several changes, all for the better. We are at Prufrock Academy, a boarding school, instead of with a relative. Secondly, the Baudelaires acquire two friends at this new school. There are additional positives. They actually get to eat, they get to study, and they get to read. For a moment you might actually think that things are looking up for the Baudelaires. Ah, but for those familiar with the series, you know that can't be true.If the Baudelaires violate any of a series of bizarre rules they must endure a series of equally bizarre punishments relating to their meals. Included in this list of punishments is loss of silverware, loss of a cup, though you still get your drink, it's just in a puddle on your tray, and even having your hands tied behind your back at mealtime.As you have probably also guessed, Count Olaf does eventually show up, but does not immediately try to kidnap the children. The children try to figure out his scheme all the way up to the point where he does execute his scheme, and I can say no more or you will miss all the fun.In \\"The Ersatz Elevator\\" the Baudelaire orphans move in with a non-relative in a penthouse apartment. While you might think that a penthouse apartment (which has something like 71 bedrooms) and kitchens, and sitting rooms, and on and on, would be a lovely place to live, you would be thinking wrong.This time the problem is that Esme Squalor (the sixth most important financial advisor in the city) and her husband Jerome must have everything \\"in\\". Esme must go to only the \\"in\\" restaurants; she must wear only \\"in\\" clothes, which includes the children, and on and on. Unfortunately, being \\"in\\" also means multiple compromises in terms of comfort. For example, the penthouse is on the top of a building with 66 stories, and elevators are \\"out\\". So the Squalors and the Baudelaires must walk up and down the 66 stories each time the go in to and out from the building. They certainly received sufficient exercise. Before I forget, orphans are also \\"in\\".Of course, we know that Count Olaf must eventually show up, and he does. However, there is a mystery. We find that Count Olaf went up to the apartment and did not later leave the building. Therein lays the crux of the mystery for this story.This box set is a great way to collect this series if you have found that you like the unconventional way the Lemony Snicket has written these books. I recommend them cautiously, and principally for children 8 or 9 or above."},{"Title":"The Loathsome Library: A Box of Unfortunate Events, Books 1-6 (The Bad Beginning; The Reptile Room; The Wide Window; The Miserable Mill; The Austere Academy; The Ersatz Elevator)","review":"This beginning series is great...it got me totally hooked to get the remaining books...a Harry Potteresque obession...fun reading, a great escape!"},{"Title":"Communicating Effectively for Dummiesr","review":"With this book, Marty Brounstein breaks down communications into bite-size morsels that are easily digested. This book covers a broad range of territory from speaking clearly, using active listening techniques for better understanding, dealing with conflict, and appropriate uses for email, telephone and other forms of communication.There's a tremendous amount of information, and I find myself going back to review the material often, especially when a meeting or conversation goes badly.There is nothing here you can't find in other books, but it's all collected neatly under one cover, and the author presents the material in interesting ways that make it easier to absorb and put into practice.Definitely a worthwhile read!"},{"Title":"Communicating Effectively for Dummiesr","review":"I really liked this book.

It is a decent one stop reference when you want to review your communication skills.While supervisors and low level manages are working better, the Sr. Staff is utilizing the author's tools in a micromanagement-fest. For example, the review process has become a long drawn out process that requires several hours a week for the employee to revise their personal &quot;assignment sheet&quot;. At the end of every three months you then have the employee summarize all their previous tasks for time, issues, schedule, etc. The quarterly review takes about 2 weeks with several cycles of review and rewriting with Sr. Staff members. Every detail is gone over and over. It is not uncommon to loose a week of productivity.Read the book but maintain some common sense about how you apply the information."},{"Title":"Bundy: The Deliberate Stranger","review":"I read this book after Bob Keppel's excellent 1995 work THE RIVERMAN (a never-dull glimpse into Ted's twisted psyche). I must confess this was better than I expected, but I was disappointed to some extent. While Larsen tells about the Ted he met and the experiences he covered as a reporter during the investigation, it has the feel of a TV Tie-In, as this is. It just seems like a summary of everything else written about Ted. I was impressed by the amount of detail in this book about the Chi Omega murders and Ken Katsaris' publicity stunts with Bundy exploding in Katsaris' face. Good for people just becoming aquainted with Ted."},{"Title":"Bundy: The Deliberate Stranger","review":"This book is a vivid description of what happened in the murders and crimes of Ted Bundy. He was too much of a sociopath to actually know what made him do it. Only the crimes could be adequately explained and the psyche of this fouled-up human examined. The characters and the settings make for a Dean Koontz novel, but are made much more interesting because they are real people.After reading that he killed 5 girls in one house with a block of wood, it rang true that its not the weapon but the person's intent that will kill. Its especially frightening when the homocidal maniac happens to be clever enough to cover it up as long as he did. Its a quick and easy read - email me if you know of any similar books."},{"Title":"Bundy: The Deliberate Stranger","review":"Yay! Another book to add to my 2011 book challenge. :)I read Ann Rule's \\"A Stranger beside me\\" years ago. Then I read this one....This book recites Ted Bundy's life and crimes authored by his news reporter friend Richard Larson.I quite enjoyed this book. Ann Rule's book is good too, from what I remember.Con: The book didn't have photos, of which I was disappointed.Double Con: There was one time in the book the author had said that I considered EXTREMELY inappropriate. He refereed to one of the murdered girls as to have a \\"cute fanny\\". That bothered me. She died a horrible death. She didn't need to be violated again, this time by the author.Anyway, This book offers more detailed accounts on his crimes. Its grisly, but it needs to be told.It was a pretty cool read. It did bounce the events in the book too much for my taste, but it was easy to understand what was going on anyway."},{"Title":"Stranger within the gates","review":"This book is baffling yet enjoyable, with a neatly wrapped up &quot;deus ex machina&quot; ending that makes little sense. Most of today's modern families will not be able to relate very well to the family, because in addition to being wealthy, they seem insular and out of touch with the rest of the world. Because of Rex's traditional upbringing, it's hard to understand why he chooses to marry Florimel, although once he brings Florrie home, the fun begins.While Florrie is intended as an entirely selfish and scheming character, nonetheless I found myself laughing aloud at some of her actions, including a wanton dance in front of the family's horried friends. The book also contains several mentions of her black eyes &quot;snapping&quot; as she spoke, and I'm still unsure how eyes can snap! The depiction of Florrie does not stand up well over time, because today's reader will just find her ridiculous rather than menacing.It's also hard to feel sorry for Rex after he thoughtlessly brought Florrie home, especially considering that he was young and had no way to provide for her. However, I did feel sympathy for the mother and her despair over her son's marriage (which in those times would normally be a lifelong commitment) to someone who doesn't fit in the family at all.The writing itself is fine, even if the plot is uneven. As mentioned before, though, the ending is puzzling since, while it takes care of the immediate problem, it doesn't account for the sins/laws that were unwittingly broken as a result. Worst of all, nobody in the family seems to learn anything from the experience, unless perhaps Rex learns not to marry any more hussies he finds on the street. For a supposedly Christian book, it doesn't really embody Christian love or wisdom, but it is enjoyable as a timepiece.For a much more thoughtful and edifying Grace Livingston Hill book, I recommend &quot;Blue Ruin&quot;."},{"Title":"Stranger within the gates","review":"I agree this is a little atypical for Grace, but thats not a bad thing!

This is the most transformative book I have read in my life - it lays out clear steps on how to live a happy and meaningful life and build a truly lasting meaningful marriage. In very simple terms the author explains very deep and powerful concepts and tools that will help you avoid major mistakes and a lot of unnecessary anguish in life. There are thousands books on self help, self improvement, happy marriage, philosophy - volumes upon volumes of blah blah blah.

Rather, he gives practical information that one can use to find more happiness."},{"Title":"The Nature of Happiness (Little Book Matters)","review":"The author does give excellent brief reviews of the ways of acheiving happiness, but the reader should remember he is defining happiness as a relatively transient feeling of joy.

If you lived through the times and remember, \\"AMERICAN JOURNEY - THE TIMES OF ROBERT KENNEDY\\" interviews by Jean Stein edited by George Plimton, will bring back the image of \\"the last honorable politician\\" in memory . . . who lived an honorable profession.These interviews recall the man many of us knew first as the brother of President, John Fitzgeral Kennedy and as Attorney General . . . then, as a light emerging from the darkness of \\"the assassination in Dallas\\" Senator Bobby!Whatever Rober Kennedy was in and of himself and to his family, he meant \\"hope\\" to countless millions across America . . . and across the world.As the decades have passed and the \\"news stories\\" move on to a myriad number of new events and different times and speak of and photograph new faces, one look back at a photo of Robert Kennedy, or reading even one reminiscence about him, whether in this book or elsewhere,brings back the impact of the magic of his presence and person. And the special magic that he had was that he brought out \\"the best\\" in ourselves . . . it wasn't ever a matter of demonstrating how great Bobby was but rather how special \\"we\\" all are and can be.If you are too young to have memories jogged by the interviews written in this volume, then read it to experience vicariously what so many were blessed to live through and know of life in America as it was at one time . . . and perhaps let a spark of that ignite something great and positive in your own life view and philosophy . . . and action - an existential encounter with \\"hope\\".There are many books which have been written and published over the years since that \\"1968\\" . . . and many quite excellent . . . but this book presents a kaeidoscopic mirror of \\"Bobby Kennedy\\" seen through the eyes and thoughts of his contemporaries, like a diffused light spectrum through a prism . . . Bobby the man seen through the different eyes.This book was an excellent tribute to him after his death . . . and it remains a lasting experience for anyone who takes the time to read it still."},{"Title":"American Journey The Times of Robert Kennedy","review":"Since I'm of the age group that actually remembers Mr Kennedy's campaign and assasination by seeing it on television, this was a strange book to read.I remember all too well learning of his assasination - I had been assigned as part of homework to report on his campaign. I woke up to be sure I caught the news before I went to school - and there, another horrible scene was being played out. It seems unreal to me even now, after all these years.This book is basically an oral history that tells two stories - the one is the thoughts and feelings of the folks on the train and gathered to see it, the other story is of Mr Kennedy's life and the impact his life had on the world.It's broken down into various sections - his career as attorney general, working with Senator McCarthy, friends and family memories, the Cuban missile crisis - so you get a fuller picture of what Robert Kennedy was like in real life. It makes the tragedy of his death all the more poignant to learn about these things.If you want to learn more about Robert Kennedy and how he was viewed in the time period he lived and dies in, this book is a very good place to start and I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"Florence's Big Book of Salt & Pepper Shakers: Identification & Value Guide","review":"The monetary valuations of Salt &amp; Pepper Shakers in this book are virtually useless to either a collector or seller.

The author himself makes note that it was just casual note-taking that led to this booklet, not a major scholarly work he labored on.The Gods of Man covers deities from the following cultures: African, Aztec, Celtic, Chinese, Egyptian, Greek, Japanese, Mesopotamian, Norse, North American Indian, Oceanic, Roman, Santerian, Slavic, South and Central Native American Indian. Each culture has a small sampling of deities, with a brief definition of each. This book is meant more as a dictionary, NOT as large biographies of each deity.

Of Human Bondage, Cakes and Ale, The Moon and Sixpence are usually fairly easy to locate on most shelves. You must do a little digging to find this one, but it will reward your efforts.At the center of the book is Oliver Haddo, who, as you can tell from the other reviews here, is based entirely and without much thought of disguise upon Aleister Crowley, the London necromancer. The plot is indeed pure melodrama, the virginal fiance drawn irresistibly towards her doom by dark forces against which there appears to be no defense. Think of Bram Stoker, or Coppola if you haven't read the novel. Will our hero somehow find a way to overcome the great odds and emerge victorious? Will Haddo succeed in his plan of evil debauchery? Stay tuned for the heady conclusion.What saves The Magician from sinking into the morass of its conventional and even hackneyed plot is the quality of Maugham's writing. We are aware at all times that we are in the hands of an accomplished writer and artist, who can turn a tired theme into an event of wit and real pathos. At times the scenes are in fact quite chillingly rendered as well. There is real suspense here, as well as some startlingly weird and realistic depictions of the occult. The scene that comes most readily to mind is Haddo's creation of the homonculi, some home-grown little fiends he cooks up in a test-tube. Many of the scenes have a surreal edge to them, but are grounded in enough realistic detail to lend them plausibility at the same time.I would recommend this book to those who have read and enjoyed Maugham's other works, as well as to anyone who enjoys books about the occult or to fans of horror novels (of which there are legion). It's an easy and fun read and is frightening enough that it just might have you looking over your shoulder the next time you're dining in a London restaurant, double-checking to see if Haddo might not be sitting somewhere across the room. Then again, these days, a lot of women probably hope that he is."},{"Title":"The Magician","review":"This is possibly the strangest of all Maugham novels that I've read. It starts innocently enough with the type of sophisticated turn of the century Parisian characters that populate much of his fiction. The characters are lucidly established and we are slowly drawn into their relationships and longings in typical Maugham fashion. Then we are introduced to the strange eccentric character of Oliver Haddo and with each of his subsequent appearances the theme of lurking evil is masterfully developed. The plot then takes over in a way that I felt was unique for Maugham and this novel turns into a suspenseful page turner. It is in someways reminiscent of Dracula. The climax builds relentlessly and the last half of the book is virtually impossible to put down once it's begun. Wonderfully blends a horror tale with the cultural sophistication of all Maugham's writing."},{"Title":"The Magician","review":"Maugham's elegant prose, his mastery of dialog, and his uncanny ability to sketch living, breathing, three dimensional characters in a few sentences serve him well in this gripping tale of the life and crimes of the evil Oliver Haddo and the handful of unlucky nafs who fall under his spell in Paris at the turn of the last century.Unlike many of Maugham's other novels, the appeal of &quot;The Magician&quot; owes as much to the tight plotting as to the characterizations. In particular, the character of the deliciously wicked Oliver Haddo, based on the infamous Aleister Crowley, &quot;the wickedest man alive,&quot; jumps off the page. However, like Bram Stoker's &quot;Dracula&quot; (a book that in structure &quot;The Magician&quot; resembles more than a little) the plot can sag slightly when the villain is off-stage. Luckily, this is never for more than a handful of pages.Still surprisingly fresh and readable nearly a hundred years after its first publication, this book will appeal as much to the literate horror fan as to the typical &quot;Twentieth Century Classics&quot; reader."},{"Title":"The Magician","review":"Okay. First, if you want to read this because you have heard the magician is based on Aleister Crowley, it's worth reading--The magician Haddo comes across as a spoiled vengeful little boy who never grew up which seems pretty accurate based on Crowley's CONFESSIONS. If you don't know anything about Crowley, this is still a worthwhile read despite being occassionally dated and having some &quot;idiot moments&quot; (i.e., &quot;Why is the character doing that? He/She must be an idiot&quot;). The ending is particularly chilling and caught me by surprise."},{"Title":"The Magician","review":"This novel is based on a character whom Somerset Maugham met in Paris in 1897 called Aleistair Crowley. He was a liar, a boastful man and a voluminous writer of mediocre verse. He was also dabbing in Satanism, magic and occult. He inspired Somerset Maugham and served as a model for Oliver Haddo in &quot;The Magician&quot;.Arthur Burdon, surgeon of St Luke's in London, has just arrived in Paris to study the methods of the French operators. But he has also come there to see Margaret Dauncy with whom he is in love. It is Dr Porhoet, a lifetime friend of Arthur's, who introduces him to Oliver Haddo. This obese, fleshy-faced man with an imposing paunch claims to be a magician. At a dinner party, the guests can hardly believe the stories told by this charlatan. They wonder whether he is an impostor or a madman and how much he really believes what he says. Does he deceive himself or is he laughing up his sleeve at the madness of those who take him seriously? To Arthur's bewilderment, as he is about to marry Margaret, she falls under the spell of Oliver Haddo and flees with him. Yet Arthur can hardly picture into what abyss of horror and evil Margaret will be driven.A complex and perceptive novel. The theme of evil is perfectly woven into a story stunning for its action and vivid characters.I recommend the audio version from Audible.com. Listening to Frederick Davidson reading &quot;The Magician&quot; is a pure delight!"},{"Title":"The Magician","review":"This is the story about a beautiful young girl named Margaret, her friend Susie and Arthur Burdon - Margareth's guardian and fianc&eacute;e. They are in Paris, preparing the wedding of Arthur and Margaret, when they meet the strange Oliver Haddo. He is introduced to them by Dr Porhot, a friend of Arthurs'. Haddo is an eccentric character who is deeply occupied with occult mysteries and perhaps has dark powers of his own (or is he joking?)Arthur and Margaret take an instant dislike to Haddo, and when he and Arthur become enemies, strange things begin to happen...Soon the sensible and rational Arthur finds himself in way over his head in mysteries, when he tries to save the woman he loves from a truly horrible fate!The story is interesting and haunting, but the characters are a bit too rigid for my taste, and - except for Haddo - without much nuance. I'm aware that the themes they represent are the main focus of the novel, but I would have liked more &quot;3 dimensional&quot; characters (again except for Haddo).The plot is well constructed and interesting, and the explorations of the dark arts and it's practises are fascinating!I won't reveal too much of the story here, as it takes some interesting twists and turns along the way! A nice read for a rainy day, if you like suspense and mystery mixed with love and occultism!"},{"Title":"The Magician","review":"This isn't Maugham at his best, but it's not intended to be. Rather, this is a real page-turning thriller that Maugham more or less dashed off for the fun of it. But whatever Maugham wrote, including pot-boilers like this one, was written extremely well. The Black Magic theme in the hands of a lesser writer -- e.g., Dennis Wheatley -- is usually hopelessly lurid and over the top (albeit entertaining). But this is not the case with Maugham's &quot;The Magician,&quot; which is that true rarity -- a sophisticated thriller."},{"Title":"The Magician","review":"The plot is now ridiculously common; man loves girl, girl loves man, &quot;evil&quot; other man ensnares girl, man and another girl and man's mentor attempt to save girl...I won't divulge the ending. I was surprised. This is the earliest work, I have encountered, that tells this story. Once I got beyond my thought of been there/seen this a million times in the movies and on t.v., I really enjoyed this work. I am continually impressed with Maugham's ability to write dialogue; the way in which he uses the interacting dialogue of his characters to advance the plot of the story. An early work of Maugham's and an easy, enjoyable read."},{"Title":"The Magician","review":"....the famous satanist whom Maugham was a contemporary of in turn of the century Paris. Themes of &quot;human bondage&quot; predominate, in common with Maugham's other works. Crowley himself reviewed the book in the Vanity Fair magazine at the time. A wonderful tale of travel through high society Europe and an exploration of darker human emotions. An underrated work, for which he has been accused of plagiarism."},{"Title":"The Magician","review":"Maughan...dear lovers of magic,... is a truly great writer and while this is not accorded as one of his great books, these elves, who love books about magic, both fiction and non-fiction, loved this book as well. As noted elsewhere, the book is based on Aleister Crowley, whom Maughan met in Paris just after Crowley returned from Africa where he had shot two lions that were charging him at the same time, which according to Maughan was quite an impressive feat considering the courage it took to remain calm while being so attacked. Maughan wrote that Crowley was neither as powerful nor as evil as the villain of this book. Somewhat reminiscent of Denis Wheatley's occult novels.Kyela,the silver elves"},{"Title":"The Magician","review":"Well written as you would expect; he takes the reader down a dark path, describing a situation which could very well happen anytime, anywhere; ie no nead for magic tricks here, it is a true psychological thriller"},{"Title":"The Magician","review":"I loved this book and am writing here to strongly recommend that it be read along with Moonchild by Aliester Crowley. This is a terrific suspenseful adventure. If you read both books you are in for a special treat."},{"Title":"The Magician","review":"The rabid results of a charlatan's inkling of matters occultic, and a young impressionable literary aspirant's efforts to champion intellectual Parisian bohemianism vivdly evokes the wondrous conversations he smuggled out of the &quot;Le Chat Blanc&quot;, a philosophical refuge for learned gents on the Rue d'Odessa in Paris circa the 1900's, here fictionalized &amp; crowned &quot;Chien Noir&quot; in this intriguing &amp; evocative novel. &quot;Oliver Haddo&quot;, the sinister &amp; most fascinating character the world quickly recognized is none other than Edward Alexander (Aleister) Crowley (1875-1947), the English Mage, Poet, &amp; mountain climber. Crowley, proud of the portrait painted of him, likewise had earlier written as an extended introduction to his pornographic mystery: &quot;Snowdrops From A Curate's Garden&quot;, a hilarious portrayal of the same crowd &amp; place suspiciously corroborating Maughams'? &quot;The Magician&quot; has been deemed plagiaristic compilation, but this is a bit fanatical; Somerset merely provides accurate, if lifted elswhere from unreliable sources, all variety &amp; category of magical lore which could be had in any decent bookshop as Occultism was entirely in vogue and Paris was still very much experiencing the effects of the 19th century French Occult Revival. Admittedly, the work is definitely NOT Huysmans! Still, it is this humble reader's opinion it can only be commended for providing Occulture &amp; Literature with a historical treatise under the guise of fiction, painted in the magicKal colours of an up &amp; coming, much-esteemed author, &quot;who would go on to forge much finer works&quot;---at least, that is how the book is considered by &quot;official and established academia&quot;, somewhat embarrassingly, as well as hypocritically. I feel the work is underrated, as the majority of Maugham's thematics are present as well as explored; the difference lies in that it is composed by a young writer, not yet fully matured, but not suffering any artistic lack because of it; and for that stage in the charting of a writer's progression, he was functioning at peak capacity, completely absorbed by his cast and contents. Besides, a reconciliation of the author's progression is uncalled for and unessential to &quot;properly&quot; enjoy the journey through underground occult Paris we are taken on!"},{"Title":"All one horse: Fictions and images","review":"In this brief but brilliant book, the South African writer Breyten Breytenbach (who wrote poems in Afrikaans in the 1960s and then moved on to painting and to writing most of his stories and novels directly in English) presents the reader with short narratives and watercolours. There is an equal number of texts and images.The texts can be either read as short stories or as prose poems. The title of each text is the last line or the last phrase of the text. Readers familiar with Breytenbach's metaphorical and (to some extent) allegorical universe won't be surprised with the stories, though the phrasings and the arty rhythmical intricacies are at their most consummate and their most enigmatic here.It is difficult to take the watercolours separately from the texts, because they are obviously meant to be &quot;read&quot; together with the stories. There are echoes between most of the situations that can be found in the narratives and the recurrent motifs that give depth to the watercolours.Breytenbach is a deliberately and extremely figurative artist. His practice is very different from the general tendency to more and more abstraction.And yet, the paintings are also fully post-modern. Literally speaking, the watercolours are amazing; we are lost in some kind of labyrinth, where enigmas seem to be impossible to solve. The same motifs keep coming back (pens, brushes, horse-shaped animals) but, instead of providing clear-cut links with either the stories or the similar motifs in other paintings, the recurrent motifs are confusing. In fact, Breytenbach demonstrates superbly the power of illusion: small details can be apprehended separately but can never really make a whole. The search for unity or homogeneity is but a mere illusion: variety and versatility ensure creative as well as political freedom.Everything is the same (\\"all one horse\\"), except when it isn't."},{"Title":"Directors Close Up: Interviews With Directors Nominated for Best Film By the Directors Guild of America","review":"Jeremy Kagan's Directors Up Close is a compendium of engaging, informative, insightful interviews with film directors who were each nominated for &quot;Best Film&quot; by the Directors Guild of America.

A couple of years after that, he asked me to do it instead, and I did. This is a remarkable book about a literate Yankee (Higginson &quot;discovered&quot; the poet Emily Dickinson) who &quot;discovers&quot; the South. It's also &quot;about&quot; Black soldiers in a white war, white officers in a Black regiment, self-discovery, rivers, and hope. Much of the imagery and characterization in the movie GLORY seems to have been lifted from this book: it is, after all, a first-hand narrative of war by an idealist sorely tested by politics and physical hardship. Higginson's writing of the book is in part his attempt to deal with what today we would call Post-Traumatic-Stress Disorder, and it is no wonder that the tone sometimes reminds the reader of Hemingway's &quot;Big Two-Hearted River.&quot; Because the teller of this story emerges as an interesting person per se, this edition includes some of his other essays, ranging from his fascination with slave rebellion to his appreciation for poetry."},{"Title":"Army Life in a Black Regiment: and Other Writings (Penguin Classics)","review":"In 1862 Thomas Wentworth Higginson was commissioned as a colonel in the Union Army and assigned to train emancipated slaves to become soldiers. He did so on the Sea Islands off the coast of the Carolinas. This is his story.His accounts of traveling up the St. Johns and St. Mary's Rivers during the war with his regiment were thrilling but the best chapter in my opinion was about his own personal decision to swim to the Confederate lines at night, naked, to scout out their positions. The chapter is entitled \\"A Night in the Water.\\" It is gripping stuff.The narrative has its ups and downs, but overall, this is well worth reading."},{"Title":"Army Life in a Black Regiment: and Other Writings (Penguin Classics)","review":"Thomas Wentworth Higginson, Harvard graduate, aboliishinist and Unitarian took a challange that most in his position would have shied away from. He organized the first South Carolina Regiment made up of Black slaves.This is his story told by him of the trials and endurance of his people as they struggled to learn all that a soldiar needed to know. They were more than up for the task. As you read Higginson's diary it is clear how his preconceptions are erased as he comes to know these men.This is a wonderful account by a white officer of his experience with Black troops. A volume not to be missed by the Civil War buff."},{"Title":"Appearance and reality: A metaphysical essay","review":"I'm reviewing a book which is currently out of print. &quot;Why bother?&quot;, one might ask. Well, Bradley's work is one of the clearest explanations of ideas which are central to our 20th century fascination with alternate religions. This is not to say that Bradley was exactly a mystic -- his belief system went beyond mysticism. Yet his emphasis on understanding the limits of our mental life finds strong parallels in Hinduism, Buddhism, Taoism, as well as Western 'New Age' approaches.Strangely, he wrote in the 19th century. Modern academic philosophers find his work not particularly important. Yet the average reader can gain quite a lot from reading Bradley, his writing style is clear and lucid, and after finishing the book, interested readers may find their world taking on a slightly different cast. It is disappointing to find that Appearance and Reality is out of print, because it stands, especially today, as a text which explicates basic philosophical issues in a way which remains relevant.Brian Whitaker"},{"Title":"Appearance and reality: A metaphysical essay","review":"Something must have _happened_ to Francis Herbert Bradley.He seems to have been something of a curmudgeon; at least, he was extremely reclusive and had a reputation for shooting cats. But at some point in his life he must have come to some sort of deep mystical realization.Otherwise he couldn't have written this book, which reads like a Western version of Shankara. This is philosophy in the grand old style, and it's one of the high points of British idealism.Bradley's argument doesn't always hold up in its precise details. He doesn't, for example, think that \\"relations\\" are real because (he says) they lead to an infinite regress. But Royce replied to this pretty adequately in an appendix to _The World and the Individual_. He also states firmly (and I think correctly) that there's no conceiving reality apart from experience and there's no duality in experience between subject and object. But support for this claim isn't exactly forthcoming. (Timothy L.S. Sprigge does a much better job with it in _The Vindication of Absolute Idealism_.)But the essential structure of his argument is sound and could be carried through again with a different set of examples (the standard logical paradoxes, say): the world of our ordinary experience turns out upon inspection to be contradictory, so it can't be fully and finally real; what _is_ fully and finally real is a nondual Absolute in which all those apparent contradictions are resolved through that very nonduality.Well, Bradley puts it better than that, of course, and his prose style is very pleasant to read. This work is also excerpted in James W. Allard and Guy Stock's collection of Bradley's _Writings on Logic and Metaphysics_, so if you want to read a shorter version, check that volume out.Anyway, the point is, don't ever let anybody tell you there isn't any nondualistic wisdom here in the West. In a different time and place, Bradley would have been revered as a guru -- a prospect that in all likelihood would have made him cringe, so it's probably just as well. But he's clearly trying to articulate a vision here, and few writers have tackled \\"rational mysticism\\" with such philosophical flair.I doubt that Shankara would have shot cats. Fortunately the similarities run deeper than that."},{"Title":"Appearance and reality: A metaphysical essay","review":"This book is indeed extremely important for analytic, continental, and mystic philosophers alike. Bradley's positive view, the Absolute, is proposed here as the _only way out_ of those messy analytic debates regarding topics such as appearance vs. reality, plurality, quality, and causation. Bradley's starting point: what is absurd (logically impossible) cannot exist."},{"Title":"Appearance and reality: A metaphysical essay","review":"This book, written in 1893, is one of the most important books in the history of English language philosophy. During his lifetime, Bradley was one of the best known of British philosophers, but before he died (in 1924) his metaphysical position dropped out of fashion, in part because it was attacked (and misrepresented) by Russell and Moore. In spite of their hostility, Twentieth Century analytic philosophers were profoundly influenced by Bradley. For an excellent discussion of this matter, read the first chapter of Tom Rockmore's book,Hegel, Idealism, and Analytic Philosophy. I recommend reading _Appearance and Reality_ before taking on Hegel'sPhenomenology of Spirit (Galaxy Books). Bradley's argument for absolute idealism is the best written in English. His writing is lively, frequently pointed and sardonic, a \\"good read\\". This version, a reproduction of the 1893 edition, is sturdy, well bound, on good paper. It is a bargain and a must read for anyone with a serious interest in philosophy."},{"Title":"Appearance and reality: A metaphysical essay","review":"Bradley had the misfortune to coincide in his later years with Russell and Whitehead, whose monumental work redirected Philosphy towards the realm of Mathematical Logic and Scientific Materialism. Yet, Bradley's revised version of Hegelian Idealism, strengthened by judiciously chosen elements from the British Idealist tradition, still stands as a practically inexpugnable bulwark against the inroads of those tempted by a spontaneous, unreflective materialism, namely, most of the scientific community today.Also extremely well written, witty, sharp and captivating in parts. Well worth a perusal, especially the early chapters."},{"Title":"Appearance and reality: A metaphysical essay","review":"I completely disagree with his conception of reality, but I enjoyed this book. Bradley was a precursor to the language philosophers. Everyone seems intrigued with Wittgenstein; however, Bradley is far more comprehensive and profound. Plus, he writes very good English. Bradley distinguishes subtle naunces in meaning between words and in this way is a precursor to language philosophy. I also recommend C. S. Lewis's book, A Study in Words.I'm amazed that all the books I have on language philosophy exclude F H Bradley. He did everything language philosophers did before they did it."},{"Title":"Appearance and reality: A metaphysical essay","review":"This book ISN'T out of print. An edition from Cambridge University Press is available on Amazon. This version contains dark scanned pages from a previously owned copy, replete with underlinings and scrawled marginal notes. I'm not joking. I looked up the publishing company (Kessinger), and it appears this kind of dodgy business is their schtick. The CUP version only costs a little more, and it's, well, you know, a normal book.As far as Bradley's thought is concerned. I've only read the shorter appearance bit thus far, but if want to see metaphysics at its most unhinged, this is the book for you. I for one love it."},{"Title":"Appearance and reality: A metaphysical essay","review":"This is very significant treatise on first principles. However the Kindle version is irritatingly sloppy.

Lloyd Graham, thank you for such a remarkable piece of fine scholarship. As an agnostic, I'm willing to read any book that refutes major tenants western intellectual history, and do so without any documentation. Graham is not bound by the conventions of &quot;footnotes&quot; and &quot;academic respectability.&quot; We should ally ourselves with Graham and buck the norm, refusing to abide in old myths like &quot;the need for logical coherence&quot; and &quot;sufficient evidence.&quot; Graham does not hesitate to draw upon the resources of circular arguments to refute Xianity. Nor does he need to &quot;know Hebrew&quot; in order to write about Hebrew. A real tiger.If one wishes to undermine Xianity, it is okay and legitimate to endorse the esoteric presuppositions and conclusions Graham offers, if for no other reason than because we have the same enemy as he. Thank you Graham, for making us all such critical thinkers, especially in matters theological."},{"Title":"Deceptions and Myths of The Bible","review":"As someone interested in Biblical Criticism I have enjoyed the scholarly works of authors such as Dennis McKinsey, Ferrel Till, Thomas Paine, etc. I ordered this book and read about one chapter before shipping it back. What is presented in this book are some of the weirdest new age beliefs to come down the pike in a while. The author makes astonishingly ignorant statements about planetary origins and geophysical science. He is only critical of the Bible in order to promote his own fantastic religious beliefs. Its a weird jumbo of sort of New Age Druidism. I would not waste time reading the whole book, but take my word for it, this guy is really out there.The author presents no credentials whatsoever anywhere in the book , which is not surprising, he is obviously not well versed or educated in cosmology, physics, anthropology, or history for that matter.I later found out that Citadel press publishes many eccentric new age books of this type.

His conclusions are ludicrous, and I assume he knows very little about astronomy.

It does nothing to dispel religion or God.Now, for those of you who are truely interested in the \\"truth\\" and are ready for some serious reading and thought, then I suggest the following three books.1. Magic and Religion-Their Psychological Nature, Origin andFunction - George B Vetter2. The Evolution of Man and Society - C.D. Darlington3.

Finally someone tapped with the esoteric meaning of The Bible. All these preachers: they only talk about The Bible and they don't seem to understand the first word in it. They should all read Graham's book with an open mind (too much to ask?) and maybe this will in turn open their eyes. The big questions, after you read this excellent book, are: who is Lloyd M.

Does he belong to an esoteric or secret society? and if he does, how can we get additional information on this organization?

Thanks. PepeGuitar@aol.com"},{"Title":"Deceptions and Myths of The Bible","review":"The best book I have EVER read. You'll love it, or hate it, as indicated by most reviews here rating it either 1 or 5 stars. When I first read this book as an atheist years ago, it deeply moved me. Now I believe in God, even though I'm not religious and don't care about Bible much, and reading it still moves me and makes me feel the Truth that is radiating from it. As to the difference btw. God and Creator, Mr. Graham says &quot;The Creator created man and ruthless Nature, then man in his turn created God, a human ideal necessary to spiritually aspiring man, a goal he, himself, will someday become.&quot; And &quot;There is nothing higher morally and spiritually than well developed man. As Eliphas Levi said: 'The Angels aspire to become men, for the perfect Man, the Man-God, is above even angels.'&quot; And I say &quot;He sure is, since the perfect Man is a PART of God, therefore in no way inferior to Him&quot;. If you value the voice from your soul above that of earthly/religious authorities, then you'll recognize the Truth this book reveals. Of course those who didn't developed their soul can't hear it, and will follow the &quot;truths&quot; offered to them by self apointed authorities of this world. The thing is, the REAL God may exist in some other dimention, but has no power over this world. It's only man, who thru suffering and pain creates justice, compassion, tolerance, love and other moral qualities (which totaled constitute God), and thus creating God in this World. It's OUR blood, sweat, and tears that create moral qualities (and thus God), and NOT the God of religion, so why not be truethful with ourselves, and take credit for it! By the way, the God that Mr. Graham is attacking in his book, is the religious ideal of God (that is what the ignorant and greedy priests imagined God is), and NOT the REAL God, which is actually being created by man in this world, and is worthy of praying to. In other words, the real God is OURSELVES. Wow, I think Mr. Graham would say that I learned well from his book :-) And one more thing for the truth seekers out there; I believe that there is a strong possibility that the &quot;God&quot; whom Moses followed, actually was an alien with his spaceship possesing superior technology, which would make it easy to fool a primitive man like Moses 3000 years ago, that he was a God. It would certainly explain this &quot;God's&quot; bloodthirstness, urging Moses into war, and killing of &quot;every living thing&quot;, and praising him for it. Something to think about."},{"Title":"Deceptions and Myths of The Bible","review":"As a member of the atheist community I have seen how many atheists typically go about trying to convince Christians they are wrong, and well, it never works. This book assumes creation, it assumes things that Christians consider truisms and THEN tears them apart. It puts everything into words I couldn't. It gives such a convincing argument that I doubt anyone, after reading this book with an open mind, would rely on religion as their crutch. Perhaps the most important theme presented is that God is not good, but evil, and it explains the misinterpretations and errors of the Genesis as relates to the confusion between 'life' and 'love.' The numerous chapters in the middle of the book go about in undermining specific parts of the Bible. The last few chapters concentrate on the false doctrines of Christianity and the false foundation of the Church. Let us get out of the mental Dark Ages and move onward without our burdens"},{"Title":"Deceptions and Myths of The Bible","review":"A wonderful book to expand the views of our Western culture and narrow-mindedness!

A devout Christian friend read and stole my last copy, need I say more?"},{"Title":"Deceptions and Myths of The Bible","review":"In the 30 years since this book was first published, scholars have learned a lot more about the ancient world and the pagan origins of Biblical themes and ideas. At times Graham's conclusions seem deliberately provocative, but, as someone who has always had an interest in ancient civilizations, I believe he is on solid ground with his scholarship. More recent archaeological and etymological studies have tended to support, rather than refute, his ideas.I found his interpretation of the Book of Revelation in terms of Gnosticism and Jewish astrology particularly interesting."},{"Title":"Deceptions and Myths of The Bible","review":"This is by far one of the most pathetically argued books I have ever seen. I literally laughed when I read it. The book is filled with scientific and historical absurdities along with the ever ridiculous conspiracy theory."},{"Title":"Deceptions and Myths of The Bible","review":"This book is about how the Bible is supposedly not &quot;the Word of God&quot; but a steal from Pagan sources. However those of us who have more than a passing familiarity with the Bible know that before the old covenant with Abraham and his decendents, all religions were &quot;pagan&quot; in that there was no &quot;true religion&quot; because God hadn't established one yet! After the Flood all humanity was gathered at the Tower of Babel. They all had the same &quot;religion&quot; in that they all possessed the same knowledge of Ultimate Truths and spirituality, which at that time was common knowledge. This book is a bit ironic in the sense that the title of the book would lead you to believe it's intention is to disprove the Bible as the true Word of God, but much of the evidence works to the opposite effect! One small example: The author uses the evidence that there are some four hundred accounts of Flood mythology in the world to show that the story did not originate with the Bible so it can't be the Word of God. Can you believe it? Of course the story did not originate with the Bible! If the Flood really happened--and it did--then many of the worlds cultures would have accounts of it--and they do! You see why I am confused.To me, one of the most convincing bits of evidence for Christianity and the Bible is how people will go far out of their way to try to argue them. If Christianity is false religion and the Bible a book of myths, then why would anyone waste so much time arguing it? If there was a group of people who believe the moon was made of cheese, would you spend all your time and energy trying to convince them otherwise? I doubt it. People who write Anti-Christian or Anti-Bible books or go to great lengths to argue them are Anti-Christians, which is a religion unto itself."},{"Title":"Deceptions and Myths of The Bible","review":"Graham does a fine job here of indicating how the bible is really not so unique as many people--Christian or otherwise--might believe. Virtually all bible stories, from Noah's flood to Christ's resurrection, have antecedents in the mythology of &quot;pagan&quot; peoples. While these similar myths don't prove that the stories in the bible are not historical, we should ask why a universal, omnipotent god--bent on providing us with salvation--would allow his son to preach doctrines so much like those of his contemporaries and forbears. Can't god differentiate his product from the offerings from other religions?In any event, Graham exposes biblical mythology in his &quot;Deceptions and Myths of the Bible&quot; in a manner that is at least entertaining and at most eye-opening."},{"Title":"Deceptions and Myths of The Bible","review":"Though this book offers no reference to the author or a bibliography. If you are a student of mythology you will see where he stands. The truth is sometimes hard to swallow. Exspecially if your life has been controled by Fear and Guilt. The bible offers to many contridictions, and its history, for the most part is incorrect. Now if you were to gather most of his footnotes you could make a bibliography of your own. Or if you are not a lazy couch potatoe, you can read the other myths, some that were written 100 to 1000 or more years before the bible to see the correlation. The bible was written by the had of man, with greed and focus on the material world. Once Humans make the decision to Love, we can end this 2000 year old hypocrisy."},{"Title":"Deceptions and Myths of The Bible","review":"Recently purchased this book based on the average customer review and, frankly, I can't comprehend what some of them saw in this pile of dung. The book's preface opens with the heaping of scorn and ridicule on Jews in particular and Western Man in general. Being an atheist, I do agree with a few, very few, of the author's arguments, but starting off with being so abusive sets a bad tone for the rest of the book. Had the rest of the book been a considered critique, I could have forgiven the preface. However, the author decided to jump off into trying to show how his belief system is so superior to Judeo-Christian thought. The fact that he tries to offer ASTROLOGY! as a superior belief structure would be laughable if the author then hadn't used pseudo-scientific/pseudo-philosophic terminology and jargon to try to convince the weak minded/unskeptical that there was something to his misguided efforts. The only uses I can see for this book are either as an example of how not to write a tome against superstitious belief or as a paperweight. Do yourself a favor and look for another title and if you find a good one, let the rest of us know with a good review."},{"Title":"Deceptions and Myths of The Bible","review":"In the thirty two years since this book was copywrited great strides have been made in studies on the provenance and authorship of the Bible, in scholarship on mythology, on the psychology of religion, and in the reconstruction (and creation) of Gnostic systems of cosmology. Many leading scholars corroborate Graham's conclusions, including his assertion that the earliest Christian theologians were Gnostics who imbedded esoteric ideas in the exoteric bible stories. Even given that but few would champion Graham's doctrinaire and zealous promotion of humanistic \\"New Age\\" cosmology, the author makes a cogent argument that the Bible can be interpreted in these terms. The main contribution Graham makes to the psychology of religion is tangential to these theses. By deconstructing the exoteric Bible stories, which so many of us believed to be the literal and inspired truth, and interpolating his theological premises into them, Graham sparks a shift of consciousness in the reader, a suspension of belief. We are forced to consider the question, \\"What is reality?\\" Graham's conclusions are superceded by cutting edge science. Quantum physics, and the philosophical construct which it has spawned, have gone Graham one better and hypothesized that matter itself is \\"immaterial.\\" The modern day \\"Lloyd Grahams\\" of science speak of the \\"illusion of matter\\" and the \\"creation\\" of reality\\" by the individual and the species. This is Eastern mysticism revisited in modern dress. Is all this no more than philosophical nit-picking? Not at all. Graham himself states it best. On page 350 he writes: \\"...there are those who say, It doesn't matter what men believe; it's what they do that matters. Yet what they do is but the outer expression of their beliefs.\\" We ourselves would replace the dictum, \\"Man is what he eats,\\" by the fact that Man is what he thinks."},{"Title":"Deceptions and Myths of The Bible","review":"This is a thought-provoking book. It takes the reader outside the brainwashed fairy tale \\"box\\" of Christianity, and opens the mind to a different way of thinking and viewing the Bible. Granted there are no references or a bibliography, but the book does present interesting ideas about the origins of the stories in the Bible and its interpretation.By the way, where are the references for the Bible? It has been stripped down and misinterpreted with only select portions included, and yet it is still accepted by the Christian \\"sheeple\\" as the whole truth as well as \\"historical fact,\\" which it is not and never has been.Staunch fundamentalist Christians who have bought into the ludicrous unfounded fairy tale stories of the Bible will certainly not appreciate the brilliant ideations of Mr. Graham. Christians don't research or discuss their Bible outside their own mindset group; so any ideas that don't reflect the brainwashed ideas they have bought into will cause them to attack and ridicule.Read this book if you dare. It presents many thought-provoking premises about the Bible, but only for the more educated open-minded individual who thinks for him or her self; those who are not afraid to think outside the \\"box;\\" and for those who are not one of the Christian \\"sheeple.\\""},{"Title":"Deceptions and Myths of The Bible","review":"I spent 19 years of religious bible-bopping until a good friend of mine introduced me to a videotaped lecture that recommended this book. I read it and at the age of 20, gave up on organized religion period. People are quick to use the criticism that this book has no bibliography but neither does the bible so please spare me that argument. Lloyd Graham does tell you where he receives his information throughout the book in the form of footnotes.The book goes into detail about how the scriptures are esoterically astrological principles taken literally by the ignorant. It details that the ancients knew that religion was based on astronomy(something our ancestry knew but never worshiped) and it also details the destruction that was caused in the name of organized religion. Lloyd Graham spares nobody that was involved in the propagating of the biggest lie ever told to man in this book also. I guess, that why I love this book so much(I've read 4 times). The author does not sugarcoat the truth(as most authors that speak on religion always do) nor does he spare anybody that was responsible for its prominence in the world.This book is not for the faint of heart or for those that walk around in blissful ignorance while the world around them is falling apart. It can only be recommended to those that want to know the truth and arent afraid to find out. Thanks to Deceptions and Myths Of The Bible, Im no longer a part of any organized religion. I've seen the destruction these fairy tales have caused and its safe to say that the most dangerous people on the planet are usually religious. One needs to look back into history to see that point. I strongly recommend Deceptions And Myths Of The Bible to anybody that isnt afraid to question religion and to seek truth. Chapters to look out for: Premise: A Genetic Cosmo-Conception, Chapter 1: Genesis Or Creation, Chapter 6: Noah And The Flood, Chapter 19, The New Testament, Chapter 24: Paul, Chapter 25: Christianity: Its False Doctrines and Chapter 26: The Church: Its False Foundation(my favorite chapter). Also check out the chapter on The Dark and Middle Ages for in depth description of the damage caused by Christianity in that particular time period."},{"Title":"Deceptions and Myths of The Bible","review":"I read this book a couple of years ago, and I was amazed at its contents and message. I may be going off the deep end a bit with this suggestion but I believe this should be a required reading for most religion and philosophy courses in colleges. I truly believe a vast majority of our population is being misled by what is contained in those 'holy scriptures'. This book opened my eyes to some things that have been hidden from me for a very long time. I wish that I had read this book a long time ago, before I committed my life to christianity and its beliefs. I thoroughly enjoyed this book! Please don't stop with this one. We need more, more and more like it"},{"Title":"Deceptions and Myths of The Bible","review":"When i saw the title of this book, I knew i had to purchase it. Although it did not turn out to be what i had expected, i was delighted at what i found. Graham does a great job of pointing out the hypocrisy and inconsistencies contained within the Bible. As a long time skeptic I was surprised to be presented with ideas and passages that i had completely overlooked before. At times the writing is earthy and pulls no punches, but that is exactly what is needed in a book of this sort.I was not necessarily expecting the use of metaphysics, cosmology, etc. in the work but Graham utilizes those points nicely, if not convincingly. My only reservation about the book is tha Mr. Graham gives no background information about himself whatsoever, nor does he consistently cite the works he quotes and uses. This book would be even more valuable to the reader if it contained proper citations and a bibliography. Unfortunately, there is none found within...but then again, neither does the Bible..."},{"Title":"Deceptions and Myths of The Bible","review":"For the truth on what the bible was meant to say,read this book!

To be honest...it's a great novel, but it is seriously lacking in the truth. It is full of contradictions and passages that totally defy logic and also the laws of physics.In the first chapter...about Adam &amp; Eve...Where in the geophysical time frame of the planet do they appear? Pre Neanderthal? Post Cro Magnon? What race were they? Caucasian? African? Asian? Pacific Islanders. Indian, East Indian? If you think Caucasian...then did the other races have their own Adam &amp; Eve?Deceptions and Myths of the Bible will open the eyes of anyone who is even a bit sceptical. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to know the REAL truth!"},{"Title":"Deceptions and Myths of The Bible","review":"The title implies it uncovers biblical myths and deceptions, and it does a fairly good job at that at times.That is an easy enough task. The problem I have is that Mr. Graham, on one hand, dismisses the bible as ludicrous second hand myths, and then on the other hand uses the same myth to support his own theories, most of which are even more bizzare than christianity. Overall it is well written, but I found myself skipping entire paragraphs to get passed all of Mr Grahams metaphysical tailchasing. If you are looking for a bible expose', there are better ones out there. Also I might add, Mr. Graham does little to provide documentation to support his own theories."},{"Title":"Deceptions and Myths of The Bible","review":"This book is poorly written, poorly argued, and poorly documented. It would serve the author well to consider the following statement: Assertion has no truth value. He asserts his points with poor backing."},{"Title":"Deceptions and Myths of The Bible","review":"...then the anti-Christian forces had better hang it up. As scholarship, the book is laughable. I have read other books based on Biblical criticism...and enjoyed them (even if I didn't agree with them). They were written, using proper sources by folks who can read biblical Hebrew and koine Greek. However, Mr. Graham opts for the position of ignorance and guessing when it comes to writing his &quot;literary work.&quot; There are no references to archaelogical finds or historical claims to back up his opinion. &quot;Causation&quot; and metaphysical half-truths won't work to build up a &quot;factual&quot; offense. His bizarre and rather boring astrological mumbo-jumbo is a larger pill to swallow than anything that can be created by any theologian. (I had an easier time stomaching fundamentalist half-theology...and I cannot stand the fundamentalist fringes of theology.) Furthermore, Mr. Graham's cynical and rather anti-semetic and anti-Christian rhetoric left me not only bored...but rather annoyed. If this man is such a prophet and sage as many of these reviews stated, he would at least have ammo for his flames of cynicism. I gained no counter-points or counter-beliefs to my faith--if anything, it shored up my relationship with God tighter than previously. In fine, don't waste your time with this book. There are great scholarly works that assail the secularists' cause with greater power. This was approximately 300 pages too long. (No wonder Carol Publishing went out of business.)"},{"Title":"Deceptions and Myths of The Bible","review":"The book was thought provoking, but did not provide references to check. The occasional anti-semitic remarks were somewhat bothersome and all the mystical nonsense led me to think that the author himself is very superstitious. However, the book provided me with leads which I can check myself so that I can reach my own conclusions regarding the validity of the Bible.For instance, I have always suspected that many parts of the Judeo-Christian religion were &quot;borrowed&quot; from some other religion or culture. The author implies this but does not back up his claims with references. There are a few names and titles of books sprinkled here and there, but not a proper bibliography.Additionally, I recommend that the author take a few more courses in the scientific disciplines."},{"Title":"Deceptions and Myths of The Bible","review":"This guy is a serious kook.

It's actually embarrassing how ignorant and biased Graham is. From the first pages of his book he evidences a severe lack of hermanuetical understanding. For example - Graham points out that the use of the Hebrew word &quot;Elohim&quot; to decribe the Creator in Gen. 1:1 is literally &quot;gods&quot;, thus he draws from that the idea that the Hebrew writers knew of many gods. What he fails to realize, and anyone who has studied a week of Hebrew understands, is that all pronouns that refer to &quot;Elohim&quot; are singular. This can be explained in two ways, neither of which exclude the other. First, to pluralize a singular noun in Hebrew was, sometimes, a way to show the greatness of that noun. Thus, to say 'gods' when meaning only one is acceptable. Second, the Christian idea of the Trinity, three in one, explains the seeming problem. This is just a sample of Grahams' errors -- on the first page!"},{"Title":"Deceptions and Myths of The Bible","review":"Please, if anybody can help me, I would like to send this book to Germany and need to find out if it is available in the German language.

If you are less New Age and more interested in historical scholarship or &quot;proof&quot; when trying to be persuaded, this book is a total waste, save its comedic value. I cannot prove this, but I think Graham was loaded on psychadelic mushrooms when he wrote the 300 pages of undocumentable, comic-book-like, fantasy-physics. Had he even a remote knowledge of at least one academic field he encounters, he might feel a little embarasssed at what he wrote. I am embarrassed for not only him, but these other reviewers that claim to have been enlightened from his work. Nuts.If you wanna do some Bible bashing, go with the historical-critical method and its champions. At least they know some history and can read in Greek and Hebrew."},{"Title":"Deceptions and Myths of The Bible","review":"This book represents Mr. Graham's view how the Bible should be interpreted. It is written in a polemical manner and shows that the author has read a great deal in the field of comparative religion, history, cultural anthropology as well as theosophy and anthroposophy. He apparently espouses the view expressed in the \\"Akashic Chronicles,\\" which he modified to his personal liking, and upon which he interpreted the Bible. Since cosmogony is the hallmark of this book one wonders why Rudolf Steiner's name does not show up.The book dazzles with apparent brilliance but cannot be trusted in its details.The author, of whom we are told absolutely nothing, employed Talmudic Thinking, which I have discussed inThe Moses Legacy: Roots of Jewish Suffering. It consists of knowing the result one wants to present and manipulating one's \\"proof\\" to validate it. This is the opposite of science where a hypothesis is formed and the subsequent experiment leads to partial answers which can be duplicated by others. These are then subjected to further evaluation, As such, the book presents us precisely with what the author abhorred, namely religion, albeit of the secular variety. It demands faith in the author's belief system and as previous reviews show, a fair number of people who are disenchanted with conventional theology, are willing to unquestioningly espouse his seemingly new and well thought out secular-religious point of view.Numerous examples for the statements made above could be listed and I shall give just a few. Apart from a number of factual errors, which can be excused as simple mistakes e.g. ascribing Sir Edward Grey's statement on the eve of WWI to an Earl Grey (p.443), there are others which seem to be deliberate misrepresentations. For instance the Zodiac diagram on p.3, which is correct, differs from that on p. 37 where Virgo and Libra have changed places. One might regard this as a misprint if the substitution as shown on p.37 would not provide the point the author wanted to make. Another example is on p. 284 where he claims that the Catholic Encyclopedia states that \\"the book of Luke was not written till nearly two hundred years after this event [crucifixion].\\" A quick check will reveal, however, that the Catholic Church is emphatic in dating the book to prior the fall of Jerusalem and regards it as impermissible to state otherwise. One can argue about the exact dates a given book of the Bible was written but one should not misrepresent one's sources. The statement that \\"no one in two thousand years has had the intelligence to see the deception [of Christian teaching]\\" is also wrong. The Church has been extensively taken to task since the so-called \\"Enlightenment\\" and the most blistering attack was Nietzsche's Antichrist of 1888. These are just some examples of distortions with which the book abounds. The idiosyncratic way etymologies are derived have already been commented upon by other reviewers as well as the fact that there are no references provided and one simply has to take the author's statements on faith.The author's goal seems to have been to provide the basis for more rational thinking about religious \\"truth,\\" but the means he employed failed to achieve it. Although he frequently referred to Buddha, in a positive manner, he seems to have failed to grasp the essence of his teaching which is that all the evils of this world originate in man's mind and are based on ignorance and greed. Ignorance cannot be dispelled in the manner the author proceeded and greed will not disappear with the demise of organized religion; Catholic or otherwise. Neither will wars and concomitant mass murder as Hitler, Stalin and Mao have proven.The topic of the book is of great importance for the future of mankind but the way in which the material has been presented qualifies for hamart&iacute;a, which is the Greek term for \\"sin\\" in the NT. I am not using it in the religious sense but for what it originally stood namely \\"missing the mark!\\" Since wrong use of the Bible may well plunge the world into another disaster correct exposition of the data contained therein is urgently needed. My own views on the OT have already been presented in the above named Moses book and those on the NT will be available on amazon in a few months under the title The Jesus Conundrum - Searching for Truth beyond Dogma."},{"Title":"Deceptions and Myths of The Bible","review":"This book is both practicably useful and nearly worthless. It is worthless as scholarship. It is useful as a source of ideas.Not all scholarly works include references. Some truths are obvious and need no corroboration. Graham's work is of another kind and should have them. He has no references because his ideas sound remarkably like the esoteric systems of some secret orders. One such organization headquartered on an island near England, uses studies in various mythologies to teach a nearly identical cosmology.Three things are painfully clear. First, Mr. Graham has little, if any, knowledge of Bible languages, a requirement even the poorest seminary imposes on its students. Second, he has not heeded his own advice and read other's viewpoints. There are better non-mystical cosmologies than his, done by recognized scholars who refer to sources, Zecharia Sitchin among the foremost. Compared to those alternatives, Graham falls to the ground. Third, Graham hasn't the courage of his convictions, and tells us nothing of himself or how he came to know what he presents as truth. Has he has any academic accomplishments?The thing to be pitied is that Graham has many truths scattered about; not diamonds, but more the occasional smooth, translucent rock in a pile of common gravel. How he came by them is a mystery, and that puts me in mind of John Wesley's definition of fools and madmen: &quot;From right premises, fools draw wrong conclusions, and from wrong premises madmen draw right conclusions.&quot; Learning if Lloyd Graham might be either of these isn't worth slogging through nearly 500 pages of verbosity laced with bitterness and arrogance. \\"The Myths and Gods of India: The Classic Work on Hindu Polytheism from the Princeton Bollingen Series\\" by Alain Danielou is a much better source for this information, and is available from Amazon.Is Graham's work useful? Yes, in two ways. First, for the resourceful preacher, it is a fountain of inspiration. Reverse the negatives, fold the interpretation of the older myth into the Bible story, and viola! Sorry, Mr. Graham, but after all, you should not be surprised that a churchman would do this. Second, let it be rewritten in 150 pages, some references added, and if not a small biography, then at least a photograph, that we might see (if not permitted to know) who Lloyd Graham is."},{"Title":"Deceptions and Myths of The Bible","review":"It is understandable that a person has a right to have an opinion, and, therefore, a world outlook and a religion.What, however, is not understandable is not to live and behave accordingly. Lloyd Graham's book clearly illustrates that those who call themselves Christians have total and profound ignorance of their holy book, i.e., the Bible.The consequence of that ignorance has been a vicious cycle of war, persecution, death and absolute suppression of freedom, science and learning.To those who call and consider themselves Christians I say: If you trust you own faith, put it to the test. Read Lloyd Graham's book. After all, you will either strength it, or get rid of it.One more, relevant, comment. I have read that some famous American once said that even if the contents of the Bible we completely contrary to reason, he would still believe them to be true. This attitude raises the following question: If he used his reasoning powers in the first place to chose Christianity, how come and those same reasoning powers are, as of a sudden, inadmissible when it comes to criticizing or understanding it? Does he think that God, would simply ask for blind faith? And how could any person chose religion, if not by reason, when all priests and representatives thereof claim that their's is the true will of God?Lloyd Graham clearly shows that what people believe in decides the future and fate of humanity. It is, therefore, of paramount importance to examine the truth, validity and consequences of our own beliefs, as well as, those of others.Despite the technological and scientific advances that largely depend on some few scientists and experts, the majority of the world population still lives in the dark ages. Mass media, thoroughly and effectively spread (miss)-information. Otherwise, how can war and the destruction of the environment, of nature be explained?Lloyd Graham's book, if read by all sorts of Christians, will change, to the better, the world we live in.D.

I was shocked and amused to discover that Graham is a bigger nutcase than the average Christian. His book is a bizarre screed filled with bitter anti-Semitism, new age hocus-pocus cosmological theory, astrological symbolism, and downright baffling assertions that modern astronomy has never even considered but certainly does not need investigate, such as that all planets were once suns.How anybody could take this book seriously, I do not know. But I can't say that I would not recommend reading it because it's so damn funny. Anyone considering reading Dianetics for the fun of it might try *Deceptions* instead -- this guy is every bit as whacked out as Hubbard, but Dianetics is downright unreadable in its lack of comprehensibility.

He asks that the reader read the bible critically and challenge its assertions yet he does not provide the cites to his own resources. This book is not worth the time it takes to read it since Mr. Graham asks that you accept his conclusions at face value. To bad... it would have been a good book. I will keep searching."},{"Title":"Deceptions and Myths of The Bible","review":"I read this book about 10 years ago, and actually want to re-read it and independently verify much of what is written there piece by piece. I don't think Christians should ignore this book, and should probably spend some time and some cyberspace critiquing and discussing its flaws, merits, and any misinformation. I get the feeling a lot of people have read it.Though I did like the book and found it to be thought-provoking, the main thing that makes me feel uncomfortable is that there is no biographical information on the author. I have searched web pages and news groups, but all I can find is more than a few quotes from this book, and others seeking information about the author him(her?)self, and the general reliability of his information. Obviously &quot;Lloyd M. Graham&quot; could be a pen name. However, the copyright is under simply &quot;Lloyd Graham.&quot; Also disconcerting is the total lack of a bibliography. For a book which is written with a scholarly approach, there is little scholarly research cited! Other than the Bible, only a few other books are mentioned as sources, and only as footnotes at least in the edition I have.Graham spends a lot of time outlining what can easily be described as New Age cosmology. The zodiacal precession theory he uses is reminiscent of what Anthony Burgess used as the foundation for his book &quot;The Wanting Seed&quot; (also recommended). One way to make this palatable is to view the astrological beliefs as what the [i]ancients[/i] believed, not necessarily the author, thus giving the Bible an entirely different spin than what we're used to. Someone familiar with Gnosticism would probably be more at home with this work.It should, hopefully, be obvious that much of what he writes, especially concerning our solar system is just plain wrong, and is reminiscent of Carl Sagan's synopsis of Velikovsky's &quot;Worlds in Collision&quot;. Still, how much would the ancients have known about what we know now? Again, the book is more readable if you imagine yourself living 3000 years ago or more. I don't see how anybody can realistically deny the influence of astrology in ancient religions, and be so stubborn as to deny a carry over of this symbolism into the Bible. Also, it seems that much of what Graham postulated is being increasingly supported or at least argued by modern biblical scholars, at least that's the impression I get.Graham's overall tone is angry, hostile, and contemptuous of whoever reads his book. He spends a huge chunk of his book towards the end with a scathing attack on the Roman Catholic Church, which seemed to me to be off-topic given the main subject matter.I have read some other New Age material, and Graham's book is far better than the usual pseudo-mystical fare. There is much meat; good argumentation (though little documentation), typical New Age word games (though interesting), a lot of stuff about the Bible itself and history that one may not be familiar with, and it gives the reader much to think about which is very rare in &quot;bookdom&quot;. I would hope that if the author is still with us that he would rework it into a new, better edition with a proper bibliography and with an objective tone."},{"Title":"Deceptions and Myths of The Bible","review":"This book was recommended to me by a friend some years ago.It's very abstract and quite frankly I don't believe all the points about his own comosgonic/cosmologic theories. BUT, when it comes to doing some comparative religion, this book points out very succinctly where a lot of those Bible myths originated and it wasn't on Mt. Sinai.Also, some footnotes and references would have been good. Like Isaac Asimov's Guide to the Bible, nothing is cross referenced. I find that unacceptable. But the book is otherwise quite good."},{"Title":"Deceptions and Myths of The Bible","review":"This exposition by Mr. Graham is exasperating and invaluable. Like other reviewers, I desired footnotes and references not so much to back up the author's point of view, but to use as a guide to my own research. Noting that there would be no footnotes or bibliography, I took the book as a wonderful anti-religious screed that certainly breaks down in many places but is invaluable as an ignitor of new thought-sparks in any open-minded person. I have referred to Mr. Graham's book over the years as a source for inspiration! There are few books about the Bible that will suggest better to the reader that perhaps the Emperor Jehovah is wearing no clothes. If you are not satisfied with the confusing hotch-potch that is the Western Holy Book, join Mr. Graham for a non-stop rant.In addition:Much of the criticism of this book involves the lack of documentation, footnotes and bibliography. Would those who complain of these flaws also note that their Bible equally lacks original documentation, footnotes and bibliography? Graham attacks this book on its own terms. His intention is not to present another reverent scholarly text on the group of writings known as the Bible. Yes, this is a screed, but it is a brilliant screed. Graham's hermeneutics are original and do not indulge in the incestuous patter of which you may be accustomed. Do not mistake Graham's presentation of the mindset of the writers of the Bible as his own. Do not confuse his exploration of the confusion of the Bible as his own confusion. This book may be as important to your spiritual liberty as Thomas Paine's \\"Common Sense\\" was to the freedom of the American Colonials. Let the man speak for himself:\\"There is nothing 'holy' about the Bible, nor is it 'the word of God.' It was not written by God-inspired saints, but by power-seeking priests. Who but priests consider sin the paramount issue? Who but priests write volumes of religious rites and rituals? No one, but for these priestly scribes sin and rituals were imperatives: their purpose was to found on them an awesome religion. By this intellectual tyranny they sought to gain control, and they achieved it. By 400 B.C. they were the masters of ancient Israel. For so great a project they needed a theme, a framework, and this they found in the Creation lore of more knowledgeable races. This they commandeered and perverted - the natural to the supernatural, and truth to error. The Bible is, we assert, but priest-perverted cosmology.\\" [Lloyd M. Graham, Deceptions and Myths Of The Bible, p. 1]\\"The Bible is not 'the word of God,' but stolen from pagan sources. Its Eden, Adam and Eve were taken from the Babylonian account; its Flood or Deluge is but an epitome of some four hundred flood accounts; its Ark and Ararat have their equivalents in a score of Deluge myths; even the names of Noah's sons are copies, so also Isaac's sacrifice, Solomon's judgement, and Samson's pillar act; its Moses is fashioned after the Syrian Mises; its laws after Hammurabi's code. Its Messiah is derived from the Egyptian Mahdi, Savior, certain verses are verbatim copies of Egyptian scriptures. Between Jesus and the Egyptian Horus, Gerald Massey found 137 similarities, and those between Christ and Krishna run into the hundreds. How then can the Bible be a revelation to the Jews?\\" [Lloyd M. Graham, Deceptions and Myths Of The Bible, p. 5]\\"From all this we see that the mystery of life is man-made, not God-made. When an ignorant priesthood introduced the supernatural into a perfectly natural universe, it threw confusion into the human mind. The result was a myriad warring religions and philosophies all trying like the blind men with the elephant, to explain the whole by something felt (emotional) instead of seen (mental). Only in our theory can these warring elements be harmonized, and the paradox posed by religion - divine source and savage nature - be resolved.\\" [Lloyd M. Graham, Deceptions and Myths Of The Bible, pp. 13-14]\\"Strip the theists of their mythological authority and you see the atheists have been right, not in denying a Creator, which they do not, but in denying the God of religion, which they do and rightly so. It is from these that all enlightened government comes, including that of our founding fathers, most of them atheists and we could fill pages with their atheism. In spite of this fact no avowed atheist can hold a government position. This too is due to religion. The Church fears atheism, not because it is inimical to human welfare but because it is inimical to its welfare. The churchmen want their mythical God because in him they live and move and have their cake and eat it too. The Church has thus become an institution for the care and maintenance of God, not man. You can say anything about man, and the Church will do nothing, but speak one word against its God and the whole benighted crew will rise in wrath against you. They should read Joshua again, then ask themselves which is the true God, the God of Joshua or the God of Jesus? They cannot both be right, yet Joshua was written before the darkness fell completely. That darkness is still upon the churchmen and while they sleep nature's savage forces kill and kill; compare them with Joshua's God and you find they agree completely.\\" Lloyd M. Graham \\"Deceptions and Myths of the Bible\\""},{"Title":"Deceptions and Myths of The Bible","review":"Wow, I'm surprised at all the negative reviews here. I usually expect this sort of thing from fanatics. I think those who find so much fault in this book, either haven't fully read it, lack a logical mind to understand it, or perhaps lack the imagination to consider other possibilities beyond the &quot;Creationism/ Big Bang-Evolution Paradigms&quot;. Also, I don't think it's necessary to have a purely &quot;scholarly&quot; work in this case. Graham's main thrust is to compare these ancient mythologies through the process of &quot;correspondence and analogy&quot; to which he adds a conclusion which he thinks is reasonable. Besides, &quot;scholars&quot; can often be trapped in the same old ways of thinking, particularly when it comes to translations of ancient texts. Many beliefs about the meanings of texts have been based on the assumption that the earlier translations were correct. Much of western though is based on these assumptions on top of assumptions about the myths. Therefore a new look, uncluttered by past assumptions, is at least refreshing. On the science criticism, I don't think any theory of planetary origins are set in stone. The current theory of the &quot;Big Bang&quot; has evidence that can be studied, and is based on sound logic, but I don't think you could find any open-minded scientist who would say that Graham's (or the myth's authors) theory is impossible.Perhaps the only real problem with this book is Graham's arrogance. I think he would have been much better off using phrases such as &quot;I believe&quot; and/or &quot;it seems likely they (the original myth's authors) believed, or meant&quot;, although he often uses the phrase: &quot;with our theory&quot;.Any way you look at it, this book is a must read. Even if you just get some of the meanings of the Judeo/Christian myths, you can have loads of fun checking out the others from which they were derived and see some of hidden the allegorical meanings.The controversy which is so perseveringly carried on in our own day between supernaturalists and rationalists, rests on the failure to recognize the allegorical nature of all religion. -- Schopenhauer"},{"Title":"Deceptions and Myths of The Bible","review":"All metaphysical philosophers and intrested people should read this book. The author has a profound understanding of comparitive religion. He shows that all religions teach the same thing, but that christianity only took out parts of the ancient pagan teachings to fit its own agendas. Graham is an excellent writer and a true skeptic. He examines both sides of the evidence, and comes to accurate conclusions. One of the most intresting parts of the book, is that he shows that the devil is the shadow side of god. He brilliantly shows how the christian churches did not find an original religion, but that their religion is nothing more than a rehash of ancient pagan religions. He also slams science in the process, showing that many so called scientific discoveries were known long ago. Graham is a brilliant thinker and writer as well as a careful researcher. If you want to know what a true skeptic is like, read this book. Graham spares nothing from skepticism, and in the process proves himself to be a genuine truth seeker and wise man. An excellent, brilliant book."},{"Title":"Deceptions and Myths of The Bible","review":"Those folks who have a background in, or knowledge of metaphysics and/or the occult will appreciate this thought-provoking book. While I do not agree 100% with the author, much of what he writes makes logical sense. His view that much of the Bible is a re-working of pagan myths is right on the money. At the very least, it certainly shows that there is more than one way to interpret the Bible. A fascinating read for those who are searching for the truth and aren't afraid of deposing, or should I say, exposing, their indoctrinated religious beliefs."},{"Title":"Deceptions and Myths of The Bible","review":"I have read NUMEROUS books written by Christain folks who simply spit out the same asinine &quot;insights&quot; that leads us to the current world madness.Mr. Graham's work stands out because he offers no apologies. He does not cave into being &quot;policitally correct&quot;. Many of things he covers can not be understood within the short space he has to work. So to hit as many points as he wishes to cover he leaves it up to us, the readers, to explore his insights deeper.For those Christains who wish to dismiss this work it is out of fear that perhaps the myths they have been hanging onto all their lives are just so many ghosts. Looking into our current day understanding of the atomic structure of life we find Graham just may not be so far off the mark.Is there a God? Graham does not dismiss God in his book. What he actually describes is a God that is NOT wrapped up in our stupid little twisted views of reality.In the end, man wrote the bible. Plain and simple. So all the concepts, ideas and stupidity comes from man's viewpoint. Some say God inspired man to write the bible. But the bible is NOT one &quot;book&quot; at all. It has been assembled. Picked through and chosen. How strange God could not &quot;write&quot; one clear cut work. A manual to life so to speak. Instead we have these ancient scriptures that even today are being RE-WRITTEN to better conform to what the &quot;church&quot; wants us to believe.In chats I say the bible will be completely re-written in 1,000 years. I actually think it will be completed in less time. And today we see this being done.Graham's work is not as &quot;light&quot; as some would have it. One must dig deeper to flesh out his thinking. Unlike the ready-made answers from a lost church Graham presents a pathway of study for anyone willing to take up the work. In the end, it will be the serious student who provides the footnotes to Graham's book."},{"Title":"Deceptions and Myths of The Bible","review":"I bought this book at the suggestion of a friend of mine. I can appreciate Graham's debunking the biblical myths and the notion that the god of the Old and New Testament is loving. However, I would have appreciated of he gave references and footnotes to where these older myths the bible is founded on can be located? Are these stories found on cuniform stones, ancient papyrus manuscripts, cave walls? I'm not doubting that his assertions are true. I just want to be able to talk and argue with bible boppers intelligently. Also, how do we know the ages of these older records? Carbon dating methods or just by the age of the older civilizations? You have to realize that the Jews expecially (I'm Jewish by the way) have all kinds of explanations of how the Jewish Bible is the oldest document. That Adam and Abraham spoke Hebrew and knew the Bible before it was written down. I'd really like to debunk all this BS and if I have to write another book myself, I will."},{"Title":"Deceptions and Myths of The Bible","review":"Who is Lloyd M Graham? Where does he live? If anybody can tell me I will make an annual pilgrimage on his birthday to his home and genuflect on his front lawn. My copy of this book has the word BIBLE on the cover in larger print than the rest of the title and this is fitting because this IS my Bible. I found this book in my grandmother's collection of Christian Science books. I don't know if she believed it but I know I do. This book is not targeted for everyone. If you are a die-hard Believer you will find the author both arrogant and conceited, while dismissing the book as blasphemy, wacky, and full of vein popping lies. This book is targeted for the lukewarm Believer, Agnostic, and Atheist. I won't discuss the meat of the book except to say that it reads as if the robots from Mystery Science Theater 3000 picked apart the Bible with their sarcasm, intelligence, and wit. Who knows maybe a young Tom Servo is the true author. What does need to be addressed is the wacky parts of the book. I have three theories as to why the author included these parts. The first theory is that he meant to use the wackiness as a sort of spoon full of sugar that would help the bitter medicine of picking the Bible apart go down easier. Another theory is that the wackiness of the book would allow the true Believer to easily dismiss the book as crazy while more cerebral, open minds would overlook the wacky parts. Without the wacky parts this book would be a nonstop diatribe against the Bible that would have made Lloyd Graham more hated than Salman Rushdie ever was. The third theory is that the author actually believes in the occult like wackiness he writes about, which wouldn't bode well for serious acceptance of this book by scholars. Back when I was in college I remember reading about how many great thinkers over the past 2000 years have dismissed the Bible for various reasons. Many thought it became corrupted in the years following its appearance. It seems to me that today nobody questions the authenticity of the Bible anymore. If you believe in Jesus & God then the Bible is the last word. I feel Graham's suspicion about the Bible's authors has a ring of truth about it considering the way today's Conservative Republicans twist the Bible to suit their own needs that control others. I think the most important message this book has is that we should \\"devote our time to man instead of God and to civilizing ourselves instead of saving our souls that were never lost.\\" This is my first book review and it will be my last. That is how important I think this book is to Civilization."},{"Title":"Deceptions and Myths of The Bible","review":"This is a good work, and ranks up there with Rescuing the Bible From Fundamentalism to question the abuses of power that the Church has and continues to do, all in the name of infallibility.

Lloyd Graham helps to expose the lies that we are brainwashed into believing as the truth.-Mick in Arizona"},{"Title":"Deceptions and Myths of The Bible","review":"This may be a good weapon to infuriate your Christian friends until they read it for themselves. I say this due to the glaring lack of ANY SUPPORTING EVIDENCE. Quoting poetry, philosophy, and ONES' SELF doesn't quite cut it. No Footnotes, Bibliography, Quotes, etc. I've tried looking for his subject matter on the Internet and I've found nothing. Check this book out at a local bookstore like I did.

Credibility is usually evinced with supporting evidence."},{"Title":"Deceptions and Myths of The Bible","review":"Lloyd Graham rails against people who unquestioningly believe the Bible, yet expects us to accept his system of &quot;Causation&quot; on faith. He bases his whole work on this system, which is not backed up by solid scholarship. He implies that priests invented religion out of the blue and then wrote the Bible in order to force their invention on other people. His dates for various events are questionable and his etymologies of names are often twisted to produce the desired meaning. Worst of all, anti-Semitic remarks appear every so often throughout the book.

It is designed to be that way. The truth is not available to Christians. There is not much known about Mr. Graham. That is intentional. He had the wisdom to protect himself. Truth is not owned by any one person, group or age, therefore there are no references or source material. This book is an initiation to the sacred secrets, and it is self-protected by its own format and tone. Within its rather wordy discourse can be found the 5 keys to knowledge, several of which are within the first few pages. Those with wisdom will forgive Mr. Graham for his faults, and understand that its setting and audience was c. 1970. Nevertheless, for those who are fearless and are willing to defy the higher powers, it is a gem. The universe is not yet finished and neither is the Earth or are we."},{"Title":"Deceptions and Myths of The Bible","review":"Mr. Graham's book, Deceptions and Myths of the Bible is both a deception and a myth. Mr. Graham shows little knowledge of Theology or elementary earth science. This book consists mostly of building straw men and then knocking them down. Though a reproof of the Bible and Christians, Mr. Graham uses both Christians and the Bible as references when he feels they help make his case. Where did Mr. Graham get his knowledge? Who knows. The work is greatly lacking in supporting documentation. What few footnotes that are there are very obscure. It takes too much faith to believe any of this stuff."},{"Title":"Deceptions and Myths of The Bible","review":"It's been a few years since I've read this book in my collection and I've read some fine titles of note since. Knowing what I know now, this book is fairly dangerous. Not only to the fundamentalist, but to the atheist, as well. To be blunt, there are no more footnotes or documented sources in this book than the Bible itself. To quote this book in a debate would be suicide. I will say that it's an extremely provocative piece. However, a full third of it (a New Age version of Treknobabble) left me in a state not unlike the way I formerly felt as a young Christian about why God created a world in which He had to sacrifice His Son then put the blame on us all - confused that I, perhaps, wasn't worthy to actually understand the concept in question. When I went looking for a bibliography... gasp! I was Wiley Coyote when the cliff had fallen out from under him.In my opinion, the author 's style is a bit aggessive... more like he's in a bar brawl than a discussion. My hunch is he's trying to obliterate opposition by just making them feel silly, rather than give them actual documented evidence to give them pause. Being a more mature posterchild for atheism these days, I would recommend this book for entertainment purposes only. It's an excellent Pandora's box of ideas for a thesis, too.

Footnotes? Ha! Lloyd surpases, TRANSCENDS those worthless binds that plague our non-fiction writing world. Documents and sources to back up claims? Not likely. Lloyd knows far, far better than to fall for those traps.Before Graham utterly proves the Bible wrong (without footnotes, sources, documentation. How amazing is that?) He gives an enormously insightful exposition on what the Bible teaches. Were Adam, Eve, Noah, Abraham, Terrah, Lot, Jacob... real persons? Nope, they were that all planets that were once suns, and that our sun will someday burn out and become a planet. The Bible is just a collection of this TRUTH that Graham exposes to us.

Pretty violent stuff really.Though one reviewer here finds the rhymes and riddles \\"delightful,\\" let's face it: they make absolutely no sense to today's readers adults and children. While sense is not a necessity certainly, Potter's works in general barely make sense at all and we should consider retiring many of these titles.

The little rythmes and verses Nutkin recites throughout the story are absolutely delightful. The illustrations are one of Ms. Potter's finest---filled with wonderful detail and color. Some might be offended by the way Nutkin is punished by old Mr. Brown---mainly by having his tail torn off, but if one thinks about it that is the way owls behave in nature.

Nutkin is the name of a cheeky and insolent squirrel who thinks far too much of himself until he is caught by an Owl who has both patience and wisdom as he endures many insults from Nutkin. At last he reacts and it appears that it is the end for the impudent squirrel. At the last moment he escapes from the owl's home when his tail breaks in two and he scurries off to safety. He is left with a partial tail as a reminder to mind his manners in the future. An important correction is necessary regarding this owing to an error in an above review. Nutkin did NOT chew his tail off to escape and I invite the reviewer to actually read the book so she understands this important point. This is a wonderful story for young children with many inportant messages. My own children greatly enjoyed these tales when they were young and still talk about them from time to time. There is a reason why Beatrix Potter's books remain among the best selling childrens books of all time. Her stories and the lessons therein are timeless and the moral absolutes are of critical value at a time when our anything goes culture is in chaos and espouses the worst behavior possible.

Eamon's mother died when he was a baby, and he grew up a lonely boy who learned not to ask anyone for anything. He had a comfortable existence. He was fed, clothed and educated well. He was an intelligent young man and learned to study at night while his father corrected papers. Eamon became involved in Fianna Fail, Ireland's Republican Party because of his father 's influence. His father was heavily involved and may have even murdered for the cause of Ireland. Eamon went to college, and then to law school and was promoted up into the Courts because of his support of Fianna Fail. As a young man he worked with a young people's group to further the cause of Fianna Fail. It was here that he met Carmel O'Brien. He fell in love with Carmel O'Brien, but she told him he was too withdrawn, too into himself. He never really understood what she was talking about. Or, he never really listened to what she was saying. Eventually, he won her over, they married and had two children.Eamon was used to making difficult law decisions and became the top judge in his circuit. His decisions were often controversial, and his family differed in their opinion of the decisions he wrought. He preferred to be by himself and that was often apparent to his family. He could abide his wife's company, but just barely. It was not until she had a stroke that he realized how important she was to him. He cared for her until she had another stroke and died. He felt alone, all alone, He was unable to sleep in the bed they had slept in for years. He went to their summer home, and had to sleep in the car. He could not stand to be in the same room as they had been in together. He was unable to accept his loss. All this time he thought he had never asked for anything; now, he just wanted his wife back. He did all he could to avoid being in the home. He walked miles until he was exhausted. It was not until his daughter and her young son came to stay with him that he started to understand the meaning of family, of love, of sharing, of fun and of laughter. This is a book to be remembered. The more one thinks about this book, the stronger the impression it leaves. prisrob"},{"Title":"The heather blazing","review":"I didn't really like Judge Eamon Redmond until I was almost through with this book. He certainly didn't show much emotion at all through most of the story. However, my whole attitude and judgement of him changed so much by the end of this engrossing story. When Eamon was very young he stood by silently and passively watching his father die (his mother was already dead), and then when he was older and a well-respected Judge, he watched as his wife Carmel die after having a stroke. Both of these dead's and there influence on Eamon's life are minutely detailed here. Eamon seems to be an intense and very lonely person. Yes, there is some attention given to his first girlfriend, and his children (who barely know their father) but the turning point, I think, is after Carmel dies. I think Eamon finally finds his heart, and the love he was too busy to recognize before. The ending is wonderful.Colm Toibin has a way of beautifully describing family life and especially the landscape of Ireland. I learned a lot about Irish politics of that time, and how a judge makes his important decisions. A well-crafted novel from an author who has written many powerful books. I am always touched by his rich &amp; moving novels."},{"Title":"The heather blazing","review":"The Heather Blazing by Colm Toibin is a deeply emotional, deeply moving book. It's the story of Eamon Redmond, a complex man, grown on tender roots, influential friends, a keen intellect and a tangible distance between himself and those whom he loves.The book is set in three parts, each of which dips in and out of time. We are with Eamon as a child in the small Wexford seaside villages he forever regards as home. Coastal erosion changes them over time and provides, in itself, a metaphor of aging, both of the individual and the community. Eamon's schoolteacher father is a significant figure, both locally as a renowned teacher, and nationally as a result of what he accomplished in his youth in the furtherance of Irish independence and political development. Eamon's mother died when he was young, an act for which, perhaps, he could never forgive her.We also see Eamon as an adolescent, hormones abuzz, becoming aware of adulthood, a physical, intellectual and, for him, a political transformation. But it is also a time when his father's illness complicates his life. Throughout, we are never sure whether Eamon's perception of such difficulty remains primarily selfish, driven by self-interest. If we are honest, none of us knows how that equation works out.We are with Eamon when he meets Carmel, his future and only wife. They share a political commitment and a life together. And they have two children. Naimh becomes pregnant at a crucial time. Donal is successful in his own way, but perhaps inherited his father's distance in relationships.And then there's another time and another Eamon, the professional, the legal Eamon. At first he practices law, but later, at a relatively early age, he accepts a politically-driven appointment to the judiciary. He has powerful sponsors, but also toys a little with the idea that he is being kicked upstairs. The moment, however, is his, no matter how dubious the source of the patronage. And then there are the cases that he has to judge, cases that impact in their own way upon the substance of his own life, his own family, whatever that might be, however the entity might be defined. It remains a substance that is perceived mainly by others, it seems, as he enacts his training and judges other people's experience according to rules he has dutifully learned so that he might apply them dispassionately.So Colm Toibin mixes these time frames and circumstances in each of the book's three sections. We are also presented with some intellectual arguments arising from the substance of the judge's daily routine, issues with which he must grapple in his assessment of competing interests. Eventually he must address the dichotomy of terrorism versus political action, a definition that, years ago, might have left his own father on this side or that, if ever he had been identified.Eamon's friends, in hindsight, might not have been the most worthy or honest sponsors, and so, again only with hindsight, we might question his judgment. But the pursuance of interests, like life, itself, is a process, and a process that The Heather Blazing describes in its richness and illusory permanence. As the Wexford coast erodes, Eamon ages, changes, succeeds, fails, loves and loves again, all in his own way. He engages us, and yet we, like the trusting, thoughtful Carmel, his wife, we never really know him, and we never really understand why we feel that way. If only he knew himself. A quite beautiful book. Life goes on."},{"Title":"The heather blazing","review":"The story of Eamon Redmond evokes an intense poignancy of loneliness and illustrates how this loneliness empties into the lives of those closest to him. It is a profound portrayal of constraint and struggle within those limits."},{"Title":"The heather blazing","review":"This is a bittersweet tale about life. It has a quite northern-latitude-temperament. The style of the writer is somehow particular, but its hard to point out, what particular it is which is making out his style. Colm's story is sensitive and he dwells upon heavy existential subjects, like your parents are dead or the death of a loved one. Eventhough I sense this book has qualities I must admit that I am not quite sure if this book relates particularly to me. But I think I will read it a second time. By the way, to get a fuller experience of this book, you should properly drink red wine as you read it. Often during the account the sea plays a part, and there is something interesting about that. You also feel the experiences and emotions of the writer quite close. The story seems private and intimate. You are in his head, heart, body and eyes."},{"Title":"The heather blazing","review":"I really enjoyed this book and discovering Colm Toibin.

Nikola-Lisa, brings together 13 of her classic paintings, along with brief excerpts from the artist's own autobiographical writings. The result is a beautiful tribute to a remarkable artist.The book opens with a great full-color photographic portrait of Grandma Moses at work at her painting table in 1952. A brief but informative biography sets the stage for the treasures that follow.Grandma Moses was a rural New York farm wife for most of her long life, and her paintings reflect this world. Colorful, lively, and rich in detail, these paintings record and celebrate the daily lives of farm communities. We see classic farmhouses, a horse-drawn carriage, children climbing a tree, cows grazing, people engaging in chores, and other sights.Because the book focuses on a year in Grandma's world, the paintings reflect all of the seasons. We see the green fields of springtime, the brilliant foliage of autumn, and the snowy landscapes of winter. &quot;The Year with Grandma Moses&quot; is a wonderful book that captures the spirit of an American creative legend."},{"Title":"The Year with Grandma Moses","review":"I use this book to help my kindergarten students learn about Grandma Moses.

(e.g. If they say they see winter, I ask them what they see in the picture that lets them know it might be winter.) Students then begin a drawing assignment using details to visually \\"tell\\" the story of our first snowfall this year (it came BEFORE Halloween!) We then extend our learning with a book about Clementine Hunter, another wonderful and inspiring, untrained artist.

A recent meeting of a reading group of mine finally allowed me to make the time to read Howells' 1885 work, &quot;Silas Lapham&quot;. I am extraordinarily glad I did. From the start of the novel, we are drawn into the world of late 19th century Boston, post-Reconstruction America, where newly rich industrialists attempt to enter the society life of old money. Howells crafts an extraordinarily realistic look at the American Dream gone awry.&quot;The Rise of Silas Lapham&quot; begins with an interview that a local newspaperman is doing of Colonel Silas Lapham, a mineral paint tycoon. Lapham's account of his rise from the backwoods of Vermont to his marriage, to service in the Civil War, to his propagation of a successful mineral paint business is chronicled and gives us a taste of the effort and perseverance necessary for his rise, as well indicating the possibility of some potential failings, especially with regard to his one-time partner, Milton Rogers. We soon learn that Mrs. Persis Lapham aided a society woman in distress the year before, and the return of her son, Tom Corey, from Texas, signals another sort of ambition on the part of the Lapham daughters, Irene and her older sister Penelope. The rest of the novel plays out the ways in which the Laphams try to parley their financial success into social status - and how the Laphams are affected by the gambit.Howells explores a number of significant cultural issues in &quot;Silas Lapham&quot;: isolationism, social adaptability, economic solvency among all classes, personal integrity and familial ties, and the relationship between literature and life. The fact that the story is set about 20 or so years after the end of the American Civil War sets an important and subtle context that runs throughout the novel and inflects all of the thematic elements. The ways that the characters interact, the way that the society functions, even though the majority of the novel takes place in Boston, is importantly affected by the fact that Reconstruction is drawing to a close, Manifest Destiny is in full swing, and ultimately, America was at a point of still putting itself together and trying to view itself as the &quot;United&quot; States.Howells' treatment of the social interactions between the industrially rich Laphams and the old moneyed Coreys underscores the difficulty in creating and maintaining a national identity, especially when the people even in one northern city seem so essentially different. The romance story involving the Laphams and Tom Corey is obviously an important element of the story, and Howells does an amazing job of not allowing the romance plot to become as overblown and ludicrously sentimental as the works of fiction he critiques in discussions of novels throughout his own work. &quot;The Rise of Silas Lapham&quot; questions the nature of relationships, how they begin, how they endure - the contrast between the married lives of the Coreys and the Laphams is worth noting, as is the family dynamic in both instances.I'm very pleased to have gotten a chance to read this novel. Generally when I say an author or a work has been neglected, I mean that it's been neglected primarily by me. Having turned an eye now to Howells, I am very impressed with the depth of his characterization, the ways he puts scenery and backdrop to work for him, the scope of his literary allusions, and his historical consciousness. This is certainly a great American novel that more people should read. It may not be exciting, but it is involving, and that is always an excellent recommendation."},{"Title":"THE RISE OF SILAS LAPHAM","review":"William Dean Howells's &quot;The Rise of Silas Lapham&quot; is one of the earliest American novels about a businessman, and that qualification alone makes it a literary curiosity, but what is most remarkable about it is what its title character is not, rather than what he is. Silas Lapham is not a ruthless, villainously greedy tycoon who bullies his employees and relishes destroying the careers of his competitors and enemies, but a conscientious, likeable man to whom misfortune happens because of his gullibility and sense of guilt rather than hubris.Lapham is a human emblem of the new American industrial economy of the 1870s. A self-made millionaire in the paint business, he is now one of the richest men in Boston and is radiantly proud of the fact that he has earned every dollar. Having grown up poor and undereducated in Vermont, he still speaks in a rustic vernacular and has yet to understand the rationale behind the rules of high society, let alone assimilate them. A simple, practical man with a sense of duty, he even put aside his business to serve in the Civil War, in which he was seriously wounded and achieved the rank of colonel. He can be boastful and garrulous, but he is not arrogant or overbearing.Lapham is dearly devoted to his wife Persis, who in turn has supported him through thick and thin, and his two daughters. Penelope, the older girl, is relatively plain but witty and sardonic and, at least in the first half of the novel, never seems to take anything seriously; her sister Irene is the more beautiful but vapid and superficial. Irene falls for Tom Corey, the young man who comes to work for her father as a foreign sales representative, but Tom and Penelope have a mutual attraction that, Penelope fears, could break Irene's heart. This romantic subplot allows Howells to contrast Tom's family, part of the old Boston aristocracy, with the even wealthier but socially crude Laphams with whose daughter Tom's mother has snobbish doubts about his possible union.The novel has almost the air of Greek tragedy in that Lapham is a man of stature who has fatal flaws that threaten to destroy him. He is a teetotaller, and when he does take the liberty of trying some wine at a dinner party, he embarrasses himself and his family by talking too much. He abstains from gambling, but, instigated by his former business partner and current gadfly Milton Rogers, he gets into financial trouble when he stakes money on bad property and bad stocks. And, to compensate for a traumatic event in his past, he is charitable almost to a fault to a pretty girl whom he employs as a typist in his office.The style of &quot;The Rise of Silas Lapham&quot; is a dramatic realism similar to that found in the novels of Howells's contemporaries Frank Norris and Theodore Dreiser; the structure is straightforward, and the dialogue cuts to the core in laying bare the characters' sentiments and unfolding the plot. It may fall short of being a &quot;great&quot; novel, but for its candid portrayal of a specimen of the nouveau riche, it can be considered a minor monument of nineteenth century American literature."},{"Title":"THE RISE OF SILAS LAPHAM","review":"These days Howells is usually overlooked in favor of the more overtly urbane Henry James or the grittier Stephen Crane or Theodore Dreiser. That's a shame, since Howells at his best is a more varied and thought-provoking author than any of them. The Rise of Silas Lapham is Howells at his best. The title is quite ironic, of course, but ultimately spot-on, as Howells' nouveau-riche bumpkin is redeemed only in losing it all. Lapham is keenly drawn, alternately frustrating in his bluster and affected pompousness and endearing in his genuine (if sometimes poorly expressed) love for his family. Other characters are not so fortunate; one of his daughters remains mostly a cipher, and both Mrs. Lapham and Bromfield Corey, the rich scion of society whose favor Lapham so earnestly covets, are dangerously close to stock characters. Howells excels at elaborate descriptive prose focused on intricate detail, sometimes to the point of exhaustion. Some elements of the plot may seem quaint to modern readers, but Howells does not treat them with condescension. The Rise of Silas Lapham is definitely a book of its time. Perhaps it is so rewarding because his time and ours are not necessarily so different as we think."},{"Title":"THE RISE OF SILAS LAPHAM","review":"The photographs of Alfred Stieglitz still look modern and talented today, but it's nearly impossible to imagine how they would have looked to viewers in the 1890s, when they were taken. They were revolutionary, amazing, radically avant-garde. In a similar vein, the first novel about an American industrialist---a novel first printed in 1885---cannot seem so new, so fresh to our 21st century eyes. This theme startles nobody anymore. But in tracing the ups and downs of Silas Lapham, late of a Vermont village, a Civil War veteran, and founder of a fortune in 1870s Boston, Howells produced a highly original novel for his day. Lapham, his plain-spoken wife Persis, and two daughters live in luxury, thanks to the successful paint manufacturing business whose ubiquitous ads disfigured large portions of the New England countryside. Puffed up with success and not averse to considerable bragging, Lapham decides to build a sumptuous mansion on the water side of Beacon Street in the then-new district of Back Bay. At the same time, the Laphams come into contact with a family from the old Boston Brahmin elite, a family whose son falls in love with a Lapham daughter. The reaction of both families to this potential liaison, the love affair itself, and the fate of the Lapham fortune form the subject of this solid novel.William Dean Howells was and is known as one of the early American \\"realists\\", as opposed to the more romantic style that dominated most of 19th century English language literature. Not being a person well-versed in the \\"accepted wisdom\\" of literary criticism and history, I can only say that compared to later writers, for example, Crane, Norris, Dreiser, and Sinclair, to be followed later by Anderson and Lewis, I find that Howells' work still retains plenty of the more romantic elements even while he does portray the life and business of a paint tycoon with considerable accuracy and empathy. No snobbish repudiator of nouveaux riches gaucheries, Howells. This book is not a sarcastic look at the \\"ridiculous efforts of a bourgeois to climb above his station\\". Lapham may have his faults, but he is essentially a good, likeable man. If you have an interest in Boston history or in knowing what Boston life was like in the 1870s, I believe you will certainly enjoy reading THE RISE OF SILAS LAPHAM. The story is a little artificial, the language a bit outdated, I felt, though in comparison to the horrors and perversities that throng some modern works, the novel might fill a few winter afternoons with a quiet pleasure. Certain stylistic oddities surprised me, such as the sudden appearance of a narrative \\"I\\" after over 200 pages ! Howells has been quite neglected in recent times: for sure, he may not be a Dostoevsky, Balzac, or Faulkner, but don't brush him off."},{"Title":"THE RISE OF SILAS LAPHAM","review":"William Dean Howells is an unjustly neglected American Renaissance author; his prose is more readable today than Clemmens, Hawthorne or Melville. His background as a journalist no doubt helps. The Lapham family is a delight to spend a couple of hundred pages with, as they interact and ultimately fall prey to Boston brahmin society. Silas Lapham is a self-made man who scores a killing in paint from his dad's farm; he becomes a self-unmade man. You get absorbed in the world Howells describes. Especially good reading on a plane."},{"Title":"THE RISE OF SILAS LAPHAM","review":"This book blew my mind! I found it absolutely engaging and the character of Silas Lapham was endearing to the point of surprise. This book says a lot about a class conscious America and even more about how \\"mom and pop\\" capitalism gets pushed aside to make way for impersonal mega corporations.Silas Lapham is a good-hearted, yet rugged individualist who pulled himself up by the bootstraps to make a giant fortune. Once he succeeds however, there is a whole group of people at the top of the ladder ready to push him onto his face, along with his whole \\"wretched family.\\" No matter what he does to fit in with the \\"old money\\" he just can't seem to fit in and the more he works to fit the millionaire mold, the more he compromises his own values.What's best though is that we see him and his family through good times as well as through the downward spiral after his business crashes, and while it is sad, we see that they return willingly to what once was without coming out any worse.This book made me smile because the characters, especially Silas Lapham, are realistically flawed and human. I recommend this highly."},{"Title":"THE RISE OF SILAS LAPHAM","review":"To the page, this book is symmetrical in its structure. It opens with a public confession (to a reporter) and ends with a private one (to a priest). In the exact center comes Lapham's moment of realization when he is drunk at a party. There is more to the structure, but that should be enough to get you going.A reviewer below calls Lapham a 'mogul with a conscience' which is accurate. The true core of this book is the way Howells carefully built it, though. Considering it comes from an age before modernism, it certainly feels quite modern. Give it a shot."},{"Title":"THE RISE OF SILAS LAPHAM","review":"Well, I can not say that W.D. Howells was another Nathaniel Hawthorne. But what I can say is that his &quot;The Rise of Silas Lapham&quot; is A LOT better than some books that were made famous (probably for political reasons). Do not expect the superb images and construction of Hawthorne. But what we CAN expect is a timeless message about society. At first Silas is a rich money grubbing monster. (Just think of Dickens' Scrooge.) He finds ways to cut his friends out of deals, alienates his family with the want of more money, and even gets his wife upset. Ah, but later things go bad, and he starts losing money. This is when the human side of him begins to show and he becomes a very sympathetic character. In my opinion, to enjoy this even more, you must assume that before the book opens, he WAS a good and decent man. Once he ran into immense wealth, he grew detestable. So while, this is not exactly a masterpiece, the degeneration of Silas and his return to humanity is ample material to carry this book and place it in the American Museum of Literature."},{"Title":"THE RISE OF SILAS LAPHAM","review":"This is a must read book and provides a glimpse of business morals in the nineteenth century. Read first, Mark Twain's &quot;The Gilded Age&quot; and Charles Dickens' &quot;Martin Chuzzlewit&quot;. Silas' 'rise' is not ironic unless accumulation of wealth is your only value. While his monetary assets may shrink, his family 'prospers' in many ways. Clearly, Howells makes the point that honest work can bridge the gap of old rich and new. Commerce is not inherently bad, but it does ask the question, how far should one go in disclosure and protecting others from their potential investment folly."},{"Title":"THE RISE OF SILAS LAPHAM","review":"You might be able to take a man of humble beginnings and make him a rich man, but can he ever cross the line into Society? Silas Lapham becomes rich from paint that he sells, but fails totally in his attempt to become an accepted member of the upper class. The book also concerns a misunderstood love interest by one of Lapham's daughters: the young man is actually in love with his other daughter. Lapham's business fails at the end, but he doesn't sacrifice his integrity. Which is why it is only the \\"rise\\" of Silas Lapham and not the \\"rise and fall.\\" This is among Howells's best novels."},{"Title":"THE RISE OF SILAS LAPHAM","review":"While the by-line is admirably short, the text actually comes off quite linguistically, given all the maladroit proclivities that might have prevented a lesser author from treading so smoothly on wings of bread and slurry. William, whose middle name - as we are to believe - is Dean, ends his saga with the name Howells. Some may enjoy this chicanery, but I, for one, was enormously displeased. For instance, why all that talk about trade agreements in the preface yet no listing for either &quot;trade&quot; or &quot;agreement&quot; in the index? And, I must ask, why was there no index at all? One is left to wonder what other key concepts and biographical references were left un-indexed. Is there any value in such a text? The answer, quite simply, is also not available in the index. Why? I became very angry by the end. All indexed. Why? The answer, quite simply, is given five sentences before this one.

Overall this was a decent read and a wonderful addition to a collection."},{"Title":"THE RISE OF SILAS LAPHAM","review":"\\"The Rise of Silas Lapham\\" by William Dean Howells, is definitely misnamed, since at the start of the novel, the main character has already risen in terms of money and prominence, two things he is at risk of losing over the course of the novel. Howells' work is credited with being the first impotant novel that truly focused on an American businessman, a man who came from nothing to become someone to contend with, but a man who still couldn't fit into the gentile Boston society because he was noveau riche and not from old money. There are some interesting things about the plotline of this novel and even some humorous moments, but \\"The Rise of Silas Lapham\\" is ploddingly told and seems dated in comparison with contempoary novels of its time.\\"The Rise of Silas Lapham\\" begins with a newspaper interview in which the reader automatically learns Silas's hard luck background and his success in the paint business, success that has allowed him to build a mansion in the Back Bay area of Boston among the most elite townspeople. His wife and two daughters, Penelope and Irene, want for nothing, but unknowingly remain outcasts in the society. When a young man name Tom Corey (from old money) takes an interest in Laphams's business as well as in one of his daughers, Lapham sees it as a way to truly take his place among the society he so desperately wants to impress and be accepted by. However, incidents and mistakes from Lapham's past show up just as his star is on its meteoric rise, forcing him to change hiw ways, for better or for worse.Some of the standout elements of \\"The Rise of Silas Lapham\\" is the love triangle between the Lapham daughters and Tom Corey, as well as the Corey family's reaction to Tom's interest in one of the girls. Penelope Lapham is a clever and comic likable character, and there are moments when even Silas and his wife Persis are easy to identify with. However, Howells spent too much time telling the story and did not allow his characters room to breathe and exist by themselves in the minds of the readers. While not an overly long novel, I found it a difficult read because much of the story is either boring or told in a boring manner. I wish Howells had dedicated more time to the intriguing aspects of his character's life instead of on the mundane and annoying."},{"Title":"THE RISE OF SILAS LAPHAM","review":"I was assigned to read \\"The Rise of Silas Lapham\\" as part of my Gilded Age class. The novel follows the rise (and fall of the titular character). Lapham made his money from mineral paint and as part of the new-rich he seeks to raise his social status by building his dream house in Beacon Hill, Boston.To complicate matters there is a suitor for one of his daughters who comes from an old-money family. Their is a supper party that is filled with gaffs as the \\"country-bumpkin\\" Laphams try to make their way through \\"high society\\". Including a scene of the normally prohibitionist Silas getting rip roaring drunk.There is a fall and a redemption in this book. William Dan Howells wrote this book as an antidote towards the more sentimentalist novels that were produced at the time. Though the dialogue to a modern audience can seem stiff at times, you must realize he was trying to move towards a more neo-realist form of fiction.This novel is highly recommended for class assignments for: The Gilded Age, Post Civil War America, Capitalism, and Social Class Divisions, and Comedy.

This book addresses their ultimate fate .In spite of having found the book distubing , it remains my favorite in my IJN library . Shizuo Fukui has done a marvelous job in cataloging and illustrating the remaining warships and support vessels after the war . The additional photos at the back served as a stark commentary ( in addition to limited text ) as to the state of these ships before scaping or salvage . A very poignant example of the results of war on ships designed for that purpose .This book is well worth the effort of obtaining if you are a Japanese navy buff or just curious about the conclusion of the Pacific war for that navy . I strongly recommend the later version with the additional photographs .I have two very minor criticisms to add to this review . The text that accompanies Shizuo Fukui's illustrations is reproduced in it's original hand written form . This is difficult to read at times but not insurmountable . This book could have had a great deal more text but that is minor when you consider the wealth of illustrations and never seen before ( by myself ) photographs presented .An invaluable resource for any Imperial Japanese Navy fan ."},{"Title":"Japanese Naval Vessels at the End of World War II","review":"This book contains handwritten notes (in English) by an IJN Constructor Lt Cdr., setting out which IJN ships survived WW2, and what became of them. Ships' particulars are also included.This book is a very valuable semi-technical record of what ships survived, and gives a further insight into the incredible catastrophe which befell a proud nation. The narrative does not go into much detail as to how the ships ended up where they did, and offers little in the way of opinion. But it is very rich in technical facts!The appendix contains some rarely seen B&W; photos.I would strongly recommend this book to anyone having a serious interest in the history of the IJN, as it provides a sensible rounding out of the subject."},{"Title":"A Burning Obsession (Heroes Inc, Book 4) (Harlequin Blaze Series #138)","review":"I chose this book in part because the cover touted the author as a \\"USA Today bestselling author.\\" And I wanted a good steamy read. And I was in my favorite used bookstore, so the book was half price. A great deal, right? Wrong.This book features a stupidly contrived set-up, a hero who ought to be in jail for not one, but two, sexual assaults on the heroine in the first fifty pages, a heroine who has butter for brains, and a re-imagining of the laws of physics.Kimberly Hayward, a production assistant at Simitar [sic--yes, I know it's spelled wrong] Studios, has written a script about a series of heists of historical artifacts. Her boss says that he is interested in producing the script--but only if she authenticates that all of the heists can be performed as written. Contrived set-up. Yes, because all movie producers require script writers to personally act out their scripts before hand. Sheesh. But off she goes to Great Britain to play amateur thief.Unfortunately for Kimberly, (before the book starts) she gets caught by U.S. Customs going through security somewhere with rocks concealed in a padded bra. She is not arrested, but the ever-suspicious U.S. government decides that she needs to be surveilled and outsources the job to the Shey Group. Enter Jason Parker, former jewel thief pressed into service by Shey Group. Jason is also a walking hard-on for most of this book. How attractive.In the opening scenes at a library, Jason watches Kimberly's movements on the security cameras. Now, unlike most institutions who value not getting sued, the library in question has installed a security camera in the women's bathroom. Yes, the bathroom. Jason's Peeping Tom tendencies are thwarted only because the camera does not have a view into the stall Kimberly uses to change clothes. After getting into her disguise, she examines a rare book and appears, to Jason's eyes, to rip a page from it. Promptly He leaves the security office and confronts her.How does he confront her? Good question. He grabs her as she walks down a hallway and pulls her into a dark corner. Then he proceeds to hold her too close, call her \\"doll baby\\" (yeah, I almost retched at that one), and feel her up, running his hands over her bra looking for the secret compartment in it. Ms. Butter-for-Brains, AKA Kimberly, thinks maybe she ought to scream (ya think?), but then mentally refers to Jason as Mr. Too-Beautiful, Mr. Gorgeous, and Mr. Pretty-Blue-Eyes and does nothing. I guess sexual assault is OK if the guy is cute.Taking a short commercial break here...I have read two books by this author, and in both books, the male characters force sexual attentions on the female characters. Why does the author think this is romantic or even acceptable?Jason promptly joins Kimberly's tour group. Someone is trying to set Kimberly up for the thefts she is only pretending to commit, and Jason must save her. His first act is to jump naked into a bathtub with her so that he can conceal her library disguise (the clothes are under the bubbles) from the police who are about to search her room.The plot goes downhill from there.The re-imagining of the laws of physics comes when Jason supposedly looses a computer virus on a security system through an electrical outlet. This may sound great in fiction-land, but in the real world, it strains the credulity of anyone who knows even the first thing about how AC power works. No, it doesn't just strain the credulity, it breaks it in two and tosses it away.So Jason and Kimberly must figure out who is trying to frame her and why. They do so in the end, and boink each other happily along the way.And the act of boinking brings up the final stupidity in this. Kimberly's boss has asked her to add several REALLY HOT love scenes to the script. Poor Kimberly thinks that although she has a vivid imagination, she just \\"can't get in the mood\\" to write them. Later on, she thinks that she has \\"no idea what to write....\\" Poor dear, use your imagination. That's what being a writer is all about. Jason has thoroughly snooped through Kimberly's notes about changes to the script, so he knows that she wants to find a man to \\"help\\" her. He lies and tells her that her boss sent him--to help her. *wink* *wink* And she buys it. I'd say it was social Darwinism in action, but both main characters survive to the end of the book and live happily ever after.Best to spend your money on something else."},{"Title":"A Burning Obsession (Heroes Inc, Book 4) (Harlequin Blaze Series #138)","review":"This is the sequel to Susan Kearney's Bordering On Obession.

She'd checked out every heist -- and murder! -- for authenticity. Now she had to inject some more sizzle into the love scenes. Who better to help with some \\"hands-on\\" research than the mysterious but sexy Jason Parker?Field agent Jason had never tackled an assignment like this -- tail a gorgeous blonde who seemed to be up to something suspicious. And he was certain the case didn't involve indulging in sexual fantasies with Kimberly, but who could resist? She seduced him one night -- and even took notes, strangely enough!No question, their unfolding relationship was hot, explosive...obsessive.

Shocking for the faithful."},{"Title":"Triathlon Training in Four Hours a Week","review":"I am a single sporter, running marathons and half marathons, and wanted to move into something else. Triathlons seemed to be the best option so I jumped into it and did a lot of research. This book is one of the items I have that have helped me with my training for a triathlon. As a beginner I have found this book invaluable. Not necessarily for the training portions of the book on biking and running, but more for the motivational support that Harr lends. I would have run a triathlon whether I had read this book or not, but it feels comforting to have my trepidations voiced and answered.What I found particularly helpful was the chapter on swimming and the final chapter of the book that helped explain the race day. I am not much of a swimmer so that chapter help me to visualize and apply some techniques that have improved my swimming and my confidence with this sport. Additionally, the Race Day chapter helped me to visualize and to prepare for what it is I will run into and encounter during the actual race, which is something that I think I needed to read about most of all.Overall I would say that any beginning triathlete should give this book a good read. I would recommend.4 stars."},{"Title":"Triathlon Training in Four Hours a Week","review":"Great guide for someone trying to get their feet wet in this sport.Helpful suggestions and advice on everything from diet, to workout routines and mental strategies..."},{"Title":"Triathlon Training in Four Hours a Week","review":"I love this book.It has everything you need to know about training for a triathlon.It is easy to understand and follow and very inspirational."},{"Title":"Triathlon Training in Four Hours a Week","review":"A well written, though concise manual for people who want to learn how to successfully train for and complete a triathalon.It provides wonderful support to the reader/athlete and is written in such a way that it seems this training is eminently doable. Excellent step-by-step coaching throughout. Great pictures demonstrating exercises and correct body positioning.This book promises to be a &quot;must have&quot; for those willing to take their training to another level. Thank you Eric Harr!!"},{"Title":"Triathlon Training in Four Hours a Week","review":"I just finished my first triathlon this month, used this book to get me started and keep me motivated. It has different training levels for different people, great workouts and stretches, even advice for what to eat while training. There's also a bunch of inspirational stories and reminders which are very helpful for novices. Great raceday tips and checklists too! Like some of the other readers, I used this book to get me started and now i'm searching for more triathlons!"},{"Title":"Triathlon Training in Four Hours a Week","review":"Very encouraging for all levels! Doesn't come with the expectation that people have an endless supply of time or money."},{"Title":"Triathlon Training in Four Hours a Week","review":"Excellent motivational book for the non-athlete or the beginner athlete! It is put in a perfect perspective to give someone the courage and know-how to get this done! I loved it and you will too!"},{"Title":"Triathlon Training in Four Hours a Week","review":"I am not an athlete by any stretch of the imagination, heck I just had a kiddo a few months ago, but I like to challenge myself (occaisionally). This guide offers excellent structure for beginning triathlon. Information is concise and logical with insightful explanations. I found the zone training extremely helpful because in the past I have overworked my body and caused myself much frustration, not understanding why I hurt and why I would be so tired. This book is useful for not only beginners, but intermediate fitness practitioners. In fact the book designates different training regimens based on your current activity levels: Slice above couch potato, Neophyte, Fitness Enthusiast, and Single Sporter on a Mission. In summary, this book makes triathlon a lot less intimidating due to the fact each aspect of the sport is broken down into easily digestable bites. Also, I knew there was no way I'd be able to train for a triathlon in 6-8 weeks after just having had a baby. So, be realistic. If you are prone to injury, fluffy, or have setbacks following a program consistently, it WILL take you longer than 6 weeks. But if you stick to the guide, you will get it done, and by that, I mean 'finish' a triathlon. A hard core athlete may not find this book helpful; in fact the author recommends The Triathlete's Training Bible for those who have decided to make triathlon their way of life."},{"Title":"Triathlon Training in Four Hours a Week","review":"The first chapter alone motivated me to do another triathlon! I enjoyed the simplicity of the exercies and suggestions. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Triathlon Training in Four Hours a Week","review":"The product arrived in as good as expected condition, it was exactly has the seller described it."},{"Title":"Triathlon Training in Four Hours a Week","review":"I picked up this book after reading Eric's articles in Shape magazine. I just finished my first triathlon, thanks to this book! I would have never crossed that finish line without it. I can't wait for my next race!I wish I could give this book 5 stars, but it is just short of perfect. I'll highlight my problems with it, just to warn other potential readers. These are suggestions I would hope the author keep in mind if he chooses to write a new edition.First, the basis of the training breaks you into 1 of 4 categories. This is great! This allows you to graduate into higher levels of training in the future. The problem is the way you are directed to your training level. There is a 10 question quiz that will identify your training level. With all due respect to Mr. Harr, he either needs to toss out this test, or he needs to work with a psychologist to tune it to something a little more meaningful. Despite his best effort, this test does nothing but measure your motivations. I came into this working out 6 days a week for the past 18 months. While I had never done a triathlon before, I considered myself to be in excellent shape. I took the test and scored a level I, which is what he refers to as a Slice above Couch Potato. Luckily, I looked at what was involved in the training plan and realized I am more closely in tune right in between a level II or level III. Even more dangerously, I gave this quiz to a friend of mine who was terribly out of shape. She scored a Level III. If she had attempted to work out at the intensity outlined for a Level III, it would have derailed her quickly. That's too much for someone who isn't in shape! If you are racing in a triathlon for enjoyment rather than competition, this by no means makes you out of shape. As far as Eric and the quiz are concerned, however, it does. I'd strongly recommend anyone reading this to consider this for themselves. Basically, you should know what level of shape you are in. If you don't, read the descriptions of a level and the exercise routine. Last thing you want to do is put yourself in a situation where you commit 2 months to training for the triathlon and end up under or over training because of a score on a flawed quiz.The second thing that got to me with this book was the product recommendations. It was great to see the whole chapter devoted to what I need and what to look for. But some of the &quot;can't go wrong with Speedo&quot; was frustrating. Rather than tell you what it is that he likes with certain items, he just directs you to a brand name with little to no explanation. In some cases, Eric really outlined why he was recommending the brand (Giant bicycles, for instance). It would be nice to see this outlined for all products on the list.Sorry if this sounds nit picky, because this book is AWESOME! There are just a lot of things in the book that could mislead someone with limited knowledge. The book is so close to perfect - just be prepared to identify your own fitness level and ignore some of the blatant advertising, and you will be well on your way to being a triathlete!"},{"Title":"Triathlon Training in Four Hours a Week","review":"This book is perfect if you are interested in training for a triathlon, but are just not sure how to do it.I run and bike, but have never done a triathlon before. I just did not have any clue how to design a program that would allow me to incorporate running, swimming, and cycling in such a way that I would be able to finish a sprint distance triathlon.Using the program in this book I was able to train for and easily complete my first sprint triathlon.If you have any interest in training for a triathlon and do not know how, I would HIGHLY recommend this book. It is not technical. It makes you believe you can do it, and it provides a program framework that works.The program(s) in this book cover fitness levels from bare beginners all the way to single sport Gods (runners, cyclists, etc.) They are geared towards a sprint distance, but adaptable up to 1/2 ironman distance.Each program is doable (time wise). You do not need to quit your job and divorce your wife.Overall, fantastic. If you want to train but do not know where to start, this is where to start."},{"Title":"Triathlon Training in Four Hours a Week","review":"There are bigger triathlon books, and there are books with more detailed training schedules. There are books to hone your swimming, and books to make you run faster, but there is probably no better book for starting the sport of triathlon than Eric Harr'sFor starters, Harr does a decent job as a motivational writer. This is no small feat for an accomplished athlete writing to novices. Harr manages to inspire without condescending. He gets you excited about the sport.Next, he sets the stage. He goes into the basic equipment required to train for and complete the race. He gives estimates regarding costs and recommendations as to specific brands he has used (this was probably the only part of the book that felt dated, given the 2003 publication). He also asks you to give realistic assessments of your fitness and your race goals. These include simply completing the race, trying to complete a longer distance than previously, or even competing to win (more about that later). He helps a reader plan a training schedule that matches their fitness level with their goal while allowing time to have a life outside of the sport.This is followed by more detailed discussion of the various stages, with chapters on swimming technique and drills, biking (conditioning, equipment, and safety) and of course running. He discusses the importance of heart rate monitors and interval training, and he covers when to push your training, when to back. He doesn't particularly go into the science behind the training, but his recommendations are similar to other writers in the field. Above all, he strives to keep the training schedule compatible with achieving athletic success within the time constraints of the modern recreational athlete.He puts it all together in sections that describe workout plans. These are tailored to fitness level and personal goal. They include recommendations as to sport, duration, and intensity (divided into zones I to III in increasing order of difficulty). These plans are outlines, leaving some details to the athlete.This is the recommendation for the 3rd week of a 6-week plan for a \\"Fitness Enthusiast\\", the 3rd highest in his 4-level hierarchy of fitness:Week 3: Moderate IntensityMonday: restTuesday: swim for 30 minutes in zone IIWednesday: run for 30 minutes in zone III; strength train for 40 minutesThursday: swim for 30 minutes in zone I; bike for 60 minutes in zone IIIFriday: restSaturday: Brick workout - bike for 50 minutes in zone I, then run for 20 minutes in zone IISunday: strength train for 20 minutesOther miscellaneous chapters include discussions of injury prevention and treatment, nutrition, and motivation. An often overlooked aspect of endurance training is strength training, but I found that chapter to be very up to date. The exercises incorporate aspects of modern strength training, such as core training, and he discusses home as well as gym workouts.Now, is this the only book a triathlete would ever need? That depends. If your goal is to run the occasional race, even to improve on a previous time, then this will probably be enough. Experienced triathletes will probably find it aimed too far below them. The Triathlete's Training Bible by Joe Friel would probably be a better bet for an athlete trying to move from the middle of the pack to the awards table. That's not a knock on this book; it's just pitched at a different audience.In summary, anyone interested in taking up the sport of triathlon would have a hard time doing better. Start here, end at the finish line."},{"Title":"Triathlon Training in Four Hours a Week","review":"I trained for my first triathlon completely out of this book. Before I started, I was in so-so shape but didn't know how to do the crawl and could not swim a single lap without stopping. I memorized the breakdown of the swim stroke in the book, practiced for a couple of months, and then six weeks before my race (sprint at Pacific Grove 2004), I started his training plan and followed it to the letter. I lost weight, got in great condition, and ended up finishing 13th in my division! I had a fantastic race, smiling most of the way, and crossed the finish line feeling like a rock star.Just a few months ago I never thought I would ever do something like this, and now I've joined a triathlon training team and am preparing for my second race in November. I'm in the best shape of my adult life, I love cross-training, and I am very, very grateful for this book. Believe me, if I can do it, *anyone* can.

He explains how to use exercise to live a better life, rather than simply burn calories. He advises you to view workouts as a golden opportunity to &quot;bond&quot; with those you love every week. He explains how, when you finish your triathlon, mentoring others can be rewarding for you...and for them. He provides inspirational stories about people who did this and how it transformed &quot;much more than their waistline.&quot; There is also tons of nuts-and-bolts information in this book, too: how to choose the right running shoe, how to avoid injuries, how to get properly fit on your bike, how to execute the proper swim stroke, how to choose gear without over-spending, how to eat, how to lose fat, etc, etc, etc.I believe triathlon is going to be taken up by hundreds of thousands of Americans because of this book. And we need that right now. Nice work, Mr. Eric Harr. And thank you."},{"Title":"Triathlon Training in Four Hours a Week","review":"unfortunately, the magical transformation of the author into a competitive athlete is a unique event, not one that readers will replicate easily (or ever!), especially following the plans inside.the author ignores the base building necessary to race the events. athletes need to train their musculoskeletal structure to take the abuse of workouts as much as they need to get their hearts up to speed. this is best done slowly and incrementally. i think if you have been a regular athlete for at least a year before using the plan in this book, you may be fine.if you are beginning in any of the three sports, i'd advise another book to show the real process of developing the appropriate base needed to compete without injury.

This book was extremely inspirational and helped me get thru some of the rough spots during those early AM training sessions. The &quot;one minute promises&quot; &amp; &quot;motivation follows action&quot; were constants mantras going through my head. The author gives a lot of great advice, and I constantly referred to it during training.As a 39 year male starting to tip the scale near 195, I couldbarely run a 1.5 mile in early June. Since then, I have lost over 17 pounds and I'm in my best shape ever in the last 15 years. I have also had some great quality time with my kids (5 &amp; 7) who would accompany me on their bike during a couple of runs. (This made for some great &amp; unexpected interval training since my son would take off on his bike trying to catchbunnies!). I have much more energy, and it seems far easier to handle lifes daily stresses.I beat my stretch goal of under 2:00 hours with my family cheering me on.

I am a very big fan of his, so I decided to pick up his new book, even though I have no aspirations to finish a triathlon. I knew there would still be lots of information in there for me. That's because he always writes for a wide audience; he makes things apply to us all. That's why I love his writing.I was right.Triathlon Training in Four Hours a Week is indeed a book any person will benefit from. It has something for everyone, even those who do not want to do a triathlon. For example, it lays out 20 common excuses one might give not to do a triathlon (&quot;not enough time,&quot; &quot;too overweight,&quot; etc) and then Eric Harr provides compelling solutions to those things...in a way that applies to us all. I love this man.Eric Harr has a remarkable ability to make it sound it like he just sitting next to you coaching you through this. His book is motivational yet extremely easy to read as well being personal. He has given us a gift by writing this book.The workouts and the philosophy in the book DO work and not merely because of the dietary guidelines and workout schedules. Eric Harr's philosophy can and will change your life if you take it to heart.The only problem I have is with the title: Triathlon Training. Of course, it's a great book for that, but this book is so much more than a triathlon book! It's an AMAZING GUIDE!! It's packed with important wit and wisdom about health, nutrition, stretch training, aerobic workouts AND living life to the fullest, bonding more with your friends and family, being more confident and having more fun. I do like the back cover saying &quot;The Transforming Power of Triathlon.&quot;I am buying copies for everyone I know. If they decide to &quot;take the leap&quot; and do a triathlon, great.

I glanced through it, and started to train. I like the fact that Eric has different levels of training -I started on the most basic level and it works! Honestly, I have not had time to read the book cover to cover yet - but I think that's good because I've been too busy racing and training to finish the book! An inspiring book, too.

This was the first book that I've seen to have a five-star rating on every single review it received! Impressed, I ordered the book online and read everything Eric Harr has written on his website...Not only has he achieved amazing athletic feats in his chosen field, the triathlon (he began as an \\"overweight--I don't really think he was ever unfit though--legal clerk\\" who signed up for a local triathlon on a whim, and was ranked #6 in the world within the next year), but he also comes across as an intelligent, compassionate thinker who writes amazingly well, without the typical saccharine bravado and/or condescending tone usually employed by other \\"Fitness Motivational\\" speakers.Since I am training for a biathlon of running/swimming (16 weeks remaining!), I was thrilled to find that Eric Harr has written a new book for triathletes-in-training. I pre-ordered it on Amazon.com and received it three days ago.My verdict? This is the best of what Eric Harr has to offer, and that is a great deal of fitness know-how from the best athletes in the world, including but not limited to Harr's own considerable knowledge, workout and lifestyle tips & suggestions, and great motivational snippets throughout the book.I certainly encourage you to buy this book and apply its wisdom to your life, not only if you are training for a multi-sport event but if you are struggling with motivating yourself to get out there and move, or if you are not sure if what you are doing is the most efficient way to achieve maximum fitness."},{"Title":"Triathlon Training in Four Hours a Week","review":"I found this book to be a little dated, which makes the section on gear irrelevant.

Not for me. And BOOOOOR-ING.' But MAN WAS I WRONG!! This whole book is incredible. It's about getting more from the quest, from enjoying workouts more and achieving a better self-confidence from doing a triathlon. The program is very simple and easy to follow -- and it's fun (not like boring Body for Life!). The nutrition advice WORKS (I've lost 5 pounds in two weeks) and it's just such a blast. Best of all, I'll be able to tell everyone that I did a triathlon. I am so motivated to do it. Even if you never dreamed you could do a triathlon, get this book. It will show you why it's so important that you do -- and it will show you how to get there easily and enjoyably."},{"Title":"Triathlon Training in Four Hours a Week","review":"I ordered this book a few days too late. I had completed my first sprint distance triathlon and then received the book about 3 days later. After reading it, I found that it would have been extremely useful BEFORE doing my first triathlon and less useful after completing my first triathlon. A lot of the information in there I had now learned by doing. It gives some helpful suggestions, but after doing your first one I feel that there are better books out there for taking you further. After I did my first triathlon and I plan on doing another one, I feel this training plan does not suffice and I will need to search out more elaborate materials. All in all, great book for the beginner triathlete BEFORE their first race, but it's not a bad book if you still have a lot of questions."},{"Title":"Triathlon Training in Four Hours a Week","review":"When I first decided to look for a training book I got a headache looking at all the options. For the beginner this book lays it all out in a very simple format. It breaks the swim, bike and run into easy terminoligy so the beginner can understand. If this book cannot motivate you to take that step to a triathlon then nothing will. I have a friend who is simply trying to lose some weight for health reasons. I told him I would pass the book on to him and believe that he could actually compete in a triathlon if he followed the steps. Great first timer book to read and motivate you to a healthy and exciting lifestyle. It is about finishing the race not beating those who have been doing it for years. The expectations are realistic."},{"Title":"Triathlon Training in Four Hours a Week","review":"This book is an outstanding resource! It uses the latest research in cardio training: The HR zone training method popularized by the running coach Jack Daniels. The theory is to work out within 60 - 80 of your target HR. In the lower zones 60% of max heart rate, you can perform aerobically for long periods of time. While training in the 80% of max heart rate zone, you fatigue because your muscles are in the Anaerobic state. Training in HR zones allows you to work hard without overtraining or injury. My only complaint is that the formula 220 - Age = Max Heart Rate is WRONG and can mess up your training. This formula is a generalization. To properly train, you need to purchase a nice POLAR Heart monitor and you need to have an Anaerobic Threshold Test or (AT) test performed. This test will actually show you your MAX Heart Rate and your target zones. An AT test uses a computer to measure your oxygen level and your heart rate as you run on a treadmill or bike. You can get this test done at a Bike Shop or a very nice Gym. I love the technique training and the items needed for running, biking and swimming. I have been training for my sprint triathlon for about six months and I haven't been injured because I have stayed in the zones! This book also has tons of workouts for each activity in different target HR zones. Thus, you can have easy days of just casual swimming or hard days of long intervals. It also has multiple training plans from the beginner to the hard core athlete. This is book is a must have!"},{"Title":"Triathlon Training in Four Hours a Week","review":"It's hard to believe how much information you can glean about a sport from a book. But this book took me from a part-time runner to a triathlete (and I placed 4th!). Just reading the first chapter makes you want to go run immediately. The pre-race section is dead-on, I used so many of Eric's tips at my race.This is an excellent all-around training guide for beginners and amateur athletes."},{"Title":"Triathlon Training in Four Hours a Week","review":"I have been coming back to this book time and time again as I've now trained for three triathlons and my fitness level has evolved. It's amazingly helpful, motivating, and positive. I use the basic training recommendations and count down the weeks to a Triathlon Event rather than I did in my first season off the couch. This is a great book for aspirers to any Sprint Triathlon."},{"Title":"Triathlon Training in Four Hours a Week","review":"I read this book last year during my preparation for the 2009 Santa Cruz (formerly Sentinel) Olympic Triathlon. I was a strong sportsman about a decade ago (rugby, basketball), but I've been too busy ever since. Having started in endurance sport about a year ago, the triathlon was my second go, after the LA Marathon earlier the same year. In preparing for the marathon, I followed Hal Higdon's famous book, and I was enamored by it. I was expecting the same in this book, but it's not quite there yet. Although the author says that the book is suitable for both beginning and advanced athletes, the truth is that only entry level triathletes will really benefit from it. I miss more help on long term training plans, among other things.Admittedly, triathlon is a much wider topic than marathon running (about 3x, actually), but I got the feeling that this book would only serve as the glue between 3 distinct books on swimming, running and cycling, with each one providing the details for each subsport. Even that would be fair game for me, but the book also lacks sufficient coverage of important topics like season planning, basic injury prevention and recovery. It's not a bad book, but it can be greatly improved in the next edition."},{"Title":"Triathlon Training in Four Hours a Week","review":"This book was more like a motivational speech rather than a how-to for training for a first triathlon. There are some helpful tips, such as a very general outline for weekly workouts, equipment you need to bring to the event, and an introduction to some triathlon training terminology. Other than that, it was mostly motivational fluff. A nice light read, this book is good for someone contemplating signing up for a race. However, if you've already signed up for, or completed, your first race, you're already beyond this book. I would look elsewhere to actually prepare for competition."},{"Title":"Triathlon Training in Four Hours a Week","review":"If you've recently started getting into triathlon then this is the book for you. It is simple, concise, and does an excellent job of bringing beginning triathlon into reach for the everyday joe.It is broad enough in its content to cover most topics the amateur triathlete needs to know, yet specific in a number of training models to help you select the right program for your body and skill level. Great recommendation here."},{"Title":"Triathlon Training in Four Hours a Week","review":"This book has been so helpful in my training. I am just starting out and plan to run my first race in Aug. There are training schedules for all levels of athletes. So if you are a casual excerciser, swimmer, runner, or cyclist, you can pick a training schedule to fit your fitness level. His swim advice was so helpful. I could barely get across the pool the first time I tried. After reading Eric's book, I was able to swim my sprint distance twice. I couldn't believe it.There were also helpful plugs for certain products throughout the book. I know one reader thought it was a big commercial, but let's face it... we all have our favorites, and if we want to reccommend them- what's the big deal. Besides, you don't have to buy brand new.Anyways- I found the training schedules do-able as a wife and mother of a 19 month old who works PT. Except for the swimming, I can take my daughter with me when I train. I figure, on race day I should be able to sail through without the extra 25+ pounds, HA, HA."},{"Title":"Triathlon Training in Four Hours a Week","review":"I am a full-time employee, father of three, and weekend soccer coach. In other words, I don't have a ton of time to dedicate to training. This book served me perfectly!It gives you a good overview of all of the essential parts of \\"tri\\" training and in a very down-to-earth way. The different workout programs fit various fitness levels from the \\"couch potato\\" to the experienced \\"single-sporter\\". It tells you everything you can expect on race day and how to prepare for it. It's also very motivational...after reading the first chapter or two, you really believe you can do it and can't wait to get started!The book doesn't have enough detail or long enough workout programs for someone looking to compete in longer races like olympic, 1/2 or full Ironman events, but for sprint races, it's great. For longer events and more competitive racing, the book suggests \\"The Traithlete's Training Bible\\" by Joe Friel.I completed my first sprint-tri this past summer. My time wasn't great, but I didn't finish last and, for my first race, that was all I was shooting for. This year I'm going to move up a level in the workout programs to improve my time. One thing for sure is that I had a blast and now I'm hooked!!"},{"Title":"Triathlon Training in Four Hours a Week","review":"This is one of the most inspirational and informative books I have ever read.My son bought this book to train for a triathlon (he followed Eric Harr's pro career closely and idolized him), and I found the book sitting in the living room. He reads the thing constantly!Even though I don't know a thing about triathloning, it is so easy to get drawn into this book and even into possibly doing one of these things.Eric Harr covers everything in this book, from overcoming excuses (I have lots of those), to how to design a workout program to how to eat, to how to stay motivated, really motivated. That's where this guy excels: motivation. Making you want to get up off the couch and go for it. I am here to tell you that I'm a 100% sedentary guy and I typically hate exercise. Eric Harr succeeds in making me CONSIDER this triathlon thing. And I have to tell you, I'm almost excited about the idea. The book gets you thinking!!Eric Harr's Triathlon Training in Four Hours a Week is a great book, an easy read, very motivational, very information-packed and it will spark something in you. It will make you wonder if you can do this triathlon thing and it makes you imagine all the positives that will come with it. It also shows you how to accomplish the goal. I recommend it to all.Now, maybe I'll steal Harr's book from my son -- and do the triathlon and challenge my son to the finish line..."},{"Title":"Triathlon Training in Four Hours a Week","review":"I truly enjoyed reading this book and utilizing the advice Eric Harr offered. It was easy to read, well organized and made my training enjoyable. I just completed my first sprint triathlon, had a blast and now I'm training for my next race. I felt this book assisted me as I prepared mentally and physically for the race, not only by laying out what to expect race day but also the weeks leading up to it. I would highly recommend this book to any first timers out there."},{"Title":"Triathlon Training in Four Hours a Week","review":"This book is nothing close to what I had envisioned. I thought: \\"triathlon,\\" \\"training.\\" How boring! THEN I bought the book! Now I think \\"amazing!!!\\"I have completed two of Harr's six-week challenge and I have to say that the results are amazing! I took my before photos and I am already 6 pounds lighter. I have muscle definition and I have lost body fat. I never thought I'd have the time to do a triathlon, but the author lays out a simple, streamlined program all of us can do. And it's FUN. That's his whole focus: have fun, stay motivated, get results. I have three children and if it can work for me, it can work for anyone.If you want to change your shape, lose fat, gain strength, and most of all make exercise a fun, rewarding part of your life, THIS is the program for you. I also feel much younger and stronger and can fit into clothes from high school. I never thought I could do a triathlon and now I believe I can. And if I can do that, I can do ANYTHING. So far, this program has really worked in every way: mentally, spiritually and physically."},{"Title":"Triathlon Training in Four Hours a Week","review":"As I'm rather thrifty, I usually get a library book as most books of this type aren't helpful enough to warrant the expense. BUT - this book is so excellent, positive, motivating, and contains so much excellent info on training techniques and schedules that you will want to reference it throughout your training period - so I'm actually going to buy this! The explanation of how to do freestyle efficiently is better than that in my huge book written by a swimming coach. The book is very thorough, covering virtually every aspect of triathlon training and competition. I can't speak as to whether it would really work to take someone from couch potato to triathlon finisher in 8 weeks, but if it were a spint distance triathlon, I think it would. As I'm planning to go from couch potato to finishing at least in the middle of my age wave, I'm getting an 8 month start (and I think I'll need it, at the very least to lose the weight I need to lose.) There is so much in this book that I am going to want to reference again and again that the price is very well worth it. I should say that it is the second \\"beginner\\" triathlon book I've read (the other was Slow Fat Triathlete) so if you've read a lot of others this may not be quite the breakthrough for you that it was for me. But if you are starting out and want great training info and schedules, this is the place to get it. Good luck!"},{"Title":"Triathlon Training in Four Hours a Week","review":"This book is full of motivational speeches and brand promotions, but light on actual training advice. As a former competitive swimmer, I noticed that some of the advice in that area was actually wrong, so I started wondering whether biking and running sections have errors too."},{"Title":"Triathlon Training in Four Hours a Week","review":"This is the perfect book for the beginning triathlete or even the recreational/working triathlete. The book focuses more on using your head for training instead of joining your local running club for sprint sessions, and I can claim to that. A clydesdale swimmer for 12 years, I was suddenly lapping everyone by the 'chest push' advice and felt like I was cruising in the water with little effort. The book focuses on spiritual efficiency, and building on what you can do with your god given abilities rather than a mentality of tendon crunching, muscle wrenching, lung bloating and crying god training."},{"Title":"Triathlon Training in Four Hours a Week","review":"I was recently diagnosed with Type II Diabetes, after being overweight and eating too much sugar for years. This was a devastating blow to me, emotionally and physically.My doctor actually suggested I pick up a copy of Eric Harr's book -- to work my way slowly back to exercise. I began with the basic, Level I program in the book and it was a nice, gradual process. I am feeling so good these days. My doctor says my &quot;good cholesterol&quot; is up and &quot;bad&quot; is down. I've lost 14 pounds and I am aiming for my first triathlon in 3 weeks.I feel like Eric Harr's book has saved my life, because I used to hate exercise and I always ate poorly.

Not for me. And BOOOOOR-ING.' But MAN WAS I WRONG!! This whole book is incredible. It's about getting more from the quest, from enjoying workouts more and achieving a better self-confidence from doing a triathlon. The program is very simple and easy to follow -- and it's fun (not like boring Body for Life!). The nutrition advice WORKS (I've lost 5 pounds in two weeks) and it's just such a blast. Best of all, I'll be able to tell everyone that I did a triathlon. I am so motivated to do it. Even if you never dreamed you could do a triathlon, get this book.

I saw an ad for Eric Harr's book in Runner's World -- and thought &quot;Why not? I live once!&quot; I have really enjoyed reading this book. Eric Harr seems like a pretty deep guy and gives you a lot more to think about and do -- than simply training for a triathlon. He talks about things like racing on behalf of a charity to inspire yourself more. I love his nutrition chapter and meal plans and the strength-training chapter is very thorough and easy to follow. It's a touching book, too and focuses on the emotional aspect of this whole process. Great book. I would give it five stars, but he's got SOOO many fans who all worship him and give him five stars (you should see the reviews for his other book!) that I had to give him four, to keep his ego from exploding! But, between you and me, it's a 5-star book! ;)"},{"Title":"Triathlon Training in Four Hours a Week","review":"Arrived in promised condition.

Continuing with the first chapter you describe the discovery of a manuscript. Our book club just read your work and in our discussion we had quite a debate on whether or not the manuscript was truly a &quot;discovery&quot; or whether this was the author's liberty in a work of fiction. Is there any truth to the discovery of the manuscript?"},{"Title":"The Last Kabbalist of Lisbon","review":"It is As If the premise of this book licensed the author to write a book badly and with more As If's than humanly possible on one page. Unfortunately, I had recently completed &quot;Where She Has Gone&quot; by Nino Rici. It also suffers from the As If problem. One particular page of The Last Kabbalist of Lisbon contained over eight As If phrases. I found the author's lack of verbal imagination distressing. The plot is interesting and my need to know who did it kept me reading. I do wonder about the historical authenticity of nude and lascivious blacksmith's in the 1500's. Read &quot;Tuesday's with Morrie&quot; instead."},{"Title":"The Last Kabbalist of Lisbon","review":"This was an excellent book and unusual in its premise and historical perspective, a group of recovered manuscripts written by a Jewish Kabbalist, Berekiah Zarco, in 1506 Lisbon. The book is remarkable in its ability to make the reader feel as though they have traveled back in time. The historical context of Jewish history and the gruesome results of Old Christian persecution upon the Jews of Portugal were both chilling and exceptionally well written. Unfortunately, there is a fundamental element in the book that reveals a deep, persistent flaw. The main character, Berekiah Zarco, wanders Lisbon and its outskirts in search of his uncle's killer. His quest reads exactly like a role playing electronic game along the lines of The Legend of Zelda or Dungeons &amp; Dragons. In so doing, the significance of the book is seriously lessened and renders it more a trifle than an important contribution to Jewish history."},{"Title":"The Last Kabbalist of Lisbon","review":"I just finished Last Kabbalist and it was a chore to do so. The dialogue was amateurishly written and I found that I really didn't care at all about any of the characters. I AM a kabbalistic Jew and bought the book full of anticipation. After the first chapter, however, I proceeded with what could best be decribed as a dogged determination. I had to finish it to see if it ever got any better. Unfortunately, it never did. I finished it with nothing more than regret for the time I wasted in reading it. Not recommended."},{"Title":"The Last Kabbalist of Lisbon","review":"I am almost wholly convinced that this is a modern novel and that the stuff re finding the MSS is, at best a literary conceit, and more likely a marketing ploy. Because:1) It just reads modern. I can't argue for this well .. it just does. I mean I've not read any authentically 16th C Iberian Jewish novels (the nearest to that I've read is early Gothic novels and Tom Jones - yeah and I only read that as a teenager looking for mucky bits).2) Nothing in the biographical stuff re. Richard Zimler suggests he was educated in such a way as to be a possible translator for the alleged found MSS.3) if such MSS had been discovered, thena) There would have announcement and articles on it in scholarly journals, yet there are no references given to such in the book.b) There would be some mention of the museum or institution in which the MSS are now lodged.4) On p48 there is a ref to the Jews enslaved by the Egyptians building pyramids. Now according to Exodus the Jews were making bricks with which to build two store cities; there is no mention in it of pyramids and anyway the pyramids were not built with bricks. The date of the exodus from Egypt was c. 1270 BCE, having been enslaved for c. 370 years, The Old Kingdom, during which were built the pyramids ended c. 2200 BCE. So this reference to pyramids could not have occurred in MSS written in the early 16th C.Now, in general the fact that a novel is prefaced by a statement, purportedly not part of the novel, stating that the novel was written at a time other than that in which it really was written need not affect the worth of that novel. But in this case it seems to me that the pyramid reference is such an anachronism as to cast doubt on the authenticity of its account of Jewish life in Lisbon at that time. Suppose we came across a novel, supposedly written in Shakespeare's time which had him visiting Glamis Castle shortly after the events in Macbeth ?! It seems to me that Zimler in writing re. The passover celebration thought: 'Jews in Egypt' --&gt; 'Egypt' --&gt; 'pyramids' --&gt; 'Jews building pyramids'. This is a thought which might occur to someone writing re the Passover who was not part of that tradition, but it would not have come from someone in that tradition. This suggests to me not just that the novel is modern and not in any way based on the source which it claims to be based on, but that Zimmler's research is sloppy and/or his empathy with the culture of which he writes is very shallow.This seems to me to be a novel written for a supposed audience. Several have compared it with *The Name of the Rose* - I think that comparison was intended by the author. All the stuff about the Kabbala was written with the intention of pushing the buttons of literary theory buffs re reading and intertextuality and so on and so on. The stuff at the end re. Jews having no future in Europe and having to move to a Moslem land is either a piece of Zionist propaganda or a piece of black anti-Zionist propaganda.This novel has no soul, it has no authenticity. I was reminded of a quest in a computer game."},{"Title":"The Last Kabbalist of Lisbon","review":"In 1496, King Manuel of Portugal decides to convert the Portuguese Jews to Christianity rather than expelling them from Portugal. He didn't want to loose the main pillars of the country's commerce activities. However, these New Christians, as they were called, secretly persisted in their beliefs praying in Hebrew and keeping the Sabbath and as much of their rituals as was possible.One of these 'Secret' Jews was Abraham Zarco, a renowned and respected Kabbalist who was found dead with a dead naked girl by his side. The story is narrated by his nephew, Benekiah Zarco a talented young manuscript illuminator who tried to solve this enigmatic murder.This is not an ordinary thriller. It is a beautiful mystery story and a history lesson."},{"Title":"The Last Kabbalist of Lisbon","review":"Although i am a compulsive reader, i admitt that came upon this book rather accidentaly, in a bookstore. The Title got my attention, rather then the book itself. Although I'm catholic, I am an avid reader of Jewish based historical novels, so I bought it.More than the plot itself, the quality of the writing, undoubtedly superb, the insight of Kabballa, what really made me love this book (and recommend it to all people who like reading) was the real feeling of actually knowing what happened in my home city 500 years ago.I happen to live in a city that's more than a thousand years old, and I must say that reading this book gave me a clearer picture of what was, and has been, my home city than most walks and tours I take in Lisbon.Sorry about the bad English"},{"Title":"The Last Kabbalist of Lisbon","review":"This is a mystery that is also an historical novel and a condemnation of both the catholic church and the monarchies of the Iberian Peninsula. At the end of the fifteenth century, their \\"Most Catholic Majesties\\" Isabella and Ferdinand of Spain, decided to convert the Jews and Moslems of recently conquered Cordova as well as those in the rest of their kingdom. Underlying this decision was their ability to confiscate the riches and properties of anyone who didn't \\"volunteer\\" to convert. Even then, many of the 'converso' or New Christians were slaughtered to get their wealth on the argument that they were still 'secret jews'.In 1497, King Manual of Portugal was convinced by the Dominican Friars that the Jews (and Moslems) of Portugal should be brought under the protection of the Catholic Church. Jews and Moslems were forcibly brought to the baptismal font and converted. Many were driven into the Tagus River where they were baptized 'en mass'; if a few (or more than a few) drowned, no matter, their souls were saved.Ten years later (the 'New Christians' had been given twenty years to give up their evil ways) there was a 'pogrom' in Portugal, and many of the 'New Christians' were massacred and/or burned alive in the central square of Lisbon over a three day period that happened to coincide with Passover. The mobs that terrorized the city were lead by Dominican monks (many who would pay with their lives, later) who seemed to have taken especial pleasure in torturing, raping and plundering these New Christian/Jews.In this atmosphere is set this novel. A well known and respected illuminator of books (and secret Kabbalist) is found murdered (his neck is cut the way an animal has to be to be considered slaughtered in the Kosher way) along with a young woman. They are both naked and the secret room they are in is locked from the inside. His nephew and protege, must find out who has killed his uncle.This is a locked room mystery, and everything else is window dressing, but it's great window dressing and Zimler does a great job in describing both the historical, cultural and societal context within which all of the action occurs. It's a great read."},{"Title":"The Last Kabbalist of Lisbon","review":"Nah, although The Spectator's blurb asserts it in the back cover.This is basically a tale of the 1506 Lisbon pogrom of converted Jews (there weren't any other), in which 2,000 were murdered by the populace, egged on by Dominican friars.The novel is written in a dark, stark, relentless, inflamed, ominous, apocalyptic style, like Gregorio's beatiful \\"A critique of Criminal Reason\\", but even more so. It's narrated in the first person by a twenty-year old Kabbalist apprentice whose uncle is murdered by an unknown person during the pogrom; the search for the killer provides the scaffolding on which the pogrom description is hung.As a mystery the book is mediocre. Its main appeal comes from the very good and frill-less recreation of 16th C Lisbon's dwellers and atmosphere. So good in fact that I would rate it four stars were it not for some colloquialisms (\\"ok\\" and such) that contrast sharply and disagreeably with the rest of the text. Their use is a deliberate choice, so the author tells us in a note at the beginning. But IMO they do vastly more harm than good, chopping the narration's flow.Towards the end, the Kabbalist prophesies the coming of the Nazis, but, strangely enough, urges his readers to shun Christians for Moslems, and calls for benedictions upon Suleiman the Magnificent. Now it's true that the Ottoman Empire was very tolerant compared to contemporary European ones, and Muslim Spain and Portugal were a paradise for Jews compared to what came afterwards, but it's strange that Zimler should choose to exhort the Jews to leave Europe for the Umma in view of the current Jewish-Palestinian enmity. Didn't Berekiah's prophetic powers extend to 1948?To summarize: buy if you like nontrivial prose. It could be four or five stars for you!"},{"Title":"The Last Kabbalist of Lisbon","review":"Cleverly written, it accurately and convincingly conveys the history of early 16th century Portugal as well as being a &quot;page-turner&quot; of a mystery and spell-binding thriller novel. I couldn't put it down! If you liked Umberto Eco's &quot;Name of the Rose&quot;, you'll love &quot;The Last Kabbalist of Lisbon&quot;. The imagery is beautiful, the view into the world of jewish mysticism, and the vivid portrayal of this tumultous historical period is captivating. Like Eco's book, this novel has many layers of meaning and a clever, intricate mystery. However, the pace of this book is much faster than Eco's &quot;Name of the Rose&quot;...once you start reading, it is hard to put it down."},{"Title":"The Last Kabbalist of Lisbon","review":"A columnist's praise in the June 9, 2000, issue of the Mexico City newspaper Excelsior alerted me to &quot;The Last Kabbalist of Lisbon.&quot;I found the plot delightfully engaging; it was hard to put the book down. Zimler's portrait of Lisbon in 1506, with Jews being killed by the Christian majority, is vividly drawn. And it appears to be historically accurate: the Encyclopaedia Britannica confirms that there was a massacre of Jews in Lisbon that year. Reading the novel, you're in the center of a pogrom, and it's not pleasant. Zimler's portrayal of life under siege is an accomplishment in itself, and interweaving it with a well-constructed detective story is even more remarkable. The next time I'm in Lisbon, I'll walk through the Rossio and the Alfama with a more informed perspective.In sum, I highly recommend this novel. I have a few criticisms. The novel tends to portray Lisbon's Christians as unkempt savages, literally cretins (a pejorative word derived from the Latin for Christian). Zimler's vehemence in this regard surprised me. And the self-righteousness of his hero, Berekiah Zarco, becomes hard to take at times, particularly when it's combined with an intrepidity that Batman and Robin might envy. Moreover, I agree with another posting that the regular rendering of a verb &quot;to gift&quot; was irritating and distracting. (The word &quot;center&quot; was also occasionally used in odd ways, but &quot;gift&quot; was particularly grating.) I know of nothing in Portuguese that requires such usage.I wondered whether the supposedly nonfictional author's note was a literary device or a statement of historical fact. I think I've been able to figure out which it is, but the author may not want the answer posted here, so I'm not going to gift (I mean give) my opinion.

Easy to read, great story, couldn't put it down. Enjoy...."},{"Title":"The Last Kabbalist of Lisbon","review":"I have read many reviews, but I have never read anything concerning this particular book.I am however very desappointed with what I have read since I consider this to be the book of my life.This is probably because I am Portuguese and because I live in Lisbon.For me it is not important whether you know or not who the killer is ,but rather to absorb the spirit and times of a close community living in Lisbon at that time. No doubt about it my favorite book."},{"Title":"The Last Kabbalist of Lisbon","review":"Zimler's fascinating story is set in 1506, during the massacre of Jews in Lisbon. Berekiah Zarco is one of the New Christians, those Jews forced to convert to Christianity, but Zarco and his family and friends also secretly practice the Jewish faith. As the massacre overwhelms the city, Zarco discovers his uncle and an unknown woman murdered in the family cellar, locked from the inside. Obsessed with finding those responsible, Zarco, along with his former lover Farid, risks his safety hunting for clues. The two also brave the maelstrom of atrocities to find their missing relatives and friends. I found it difficult to connect with the characters at the beginning, but as the story wound itself into patterns, the book became hard to put down. I was rather surprised at the untrumpeted homosexuality of Farid, which is mentioned a few times in the book. It's treated as part of the texture of his personality and nothing more, which is as it ought to be. I think it's a great book overall, although the parallels to the Holocaust and other instances of intolerance aren't as poignant and clearcut as one would think. Still, it's highly recommended, especially for its historical detailings."},{"Title":"The Last Kabbalist of Lisbon","review":"After reading all of Chaim Potok's books, I decided this book would give another perspective on study of Kabbalah. Because many Jewish scholars have opposed study through the centuries of these mystical writings, it was fun to return to 1506 when visions and talismans were commonly believed to work.The vivid descriptive language used throughout this story can be gruesome at times, but it puts the reader in Lisbon at the time of the forced conversions of Jews.The mystery is fun to watch unfold, but the characters are a challenge to track. Because they have both Jewish names and New Christian names, it can be challenging to remember which member of the group had the scar where and what his two names are . . .If you're tired of John Grisham's predictability, try a new environment, an historical setting, and a mystical culture for the setting of a good mystery."},{"Title":"The Last Kabbalist of Lisbon","review":"I thought that Zimler did a great job giving shape to the times and places, HOWEVER . . . his use of passive verbs and especially the overuse of &quot;was gifted with&quot; just drove me nuts. I speak Hebrew and know enough Portugese to know that it is not some poetic translation of an idiom in either language. His Hebrew transliterations were sometimes unrecognizable (I'm still puzzled by a few). I found the voices of all the &quot;bad guys&quot; to be the same. This made me often have to stop and refigure out who was who. The unravelling of the mystery is rather muddy and just not interesting. The use of Farid as a human crime lab with &quot;black butterfly eyelashes&quot; was a bit of a stretch. In conclusion, texture and times: good job. Dialog internal and voiced: irritating"},{"Title":"The Last Kabbalist of Lisbon","review":"Set in 1506 Lisbon, \\"The Last Kabbalist of Lisbon\\" is a thriller that centres on a young manuscript illuminator whose uncle was found dead with a naked girl with him. The uncle was a Kabbalist and the investigation leads Berekiah into some rather unpredictable twists and turns.The novel is rich in detail as it plunges the reader into the seething masses of fear and suspicion that raged at the time. Christians were burning Jews and massacres were pretty common experiences. Even the so-called Christians who had converted from Judaism were not safe. It is some of the more violent scenes that left me with a rather bitter aftertaste.The book itself is well written, with a lot happening. I found it a hard book to second guess, which was a satisfying element to the book. The plot and setting are fairly unique, and I have not read a book exactly like it before.Also, people interested in Kabbalah might find it an interesting foray in that mysterious world. A cynic might say that it was a useful marketting ploy on Richard Zimler's part, but the whole Kabbalist angle lends the book a specialness rarely found.For crime fans, this is a book with something different and a definite alternate flavour. I enjoyed it immensely and would recommend it without reservation."},{"Title":"The Last Kabbalist of Lisbon","review":"This manages to be a novel after all... with a murder mystery woven into the threads of the fabric. It was hard to get into at first, but once I caught the cadence of the dialogue, I was hooked. The book was very thought-provoking, enjoyable, at times it was horrible to endure the graphic imagery of the violence against the &quot;New Christians&quot; ---with tears in my eyes. There was deep, spiritual love. So much violence and hatred also. But the author handled it realistically in that the aftermath the &quot;Old Christians&quot; seemed to sugarcoat what they had done to be able to deal with the atrocity of their actions."},{"Title":"The Last Kabbalist of Lisbon","review":"Like Umberto Eco's The Name of the Rose, this book can be enjoyed as a mystery, a historical novel or a romantic fiction. If you are looking for a book that will entice you to another world, another era, this is it. The prose is also beautiful."},{"Title":"The Last Kabbalist of Lisbon","review":"\\"The Last Kabbalist of Lisbon\\" by Richard Zimler manages, at once, to combine historical accuracy with a modern thriller-like story line.Berekiah Zarco is a young manuscript illustrator who tells the story of the infamous Lisbon massacre of 1506. Through his eyes we relive the sheer horror of the persecution of the Jews in Portugal. The Church and the King of Spain had begun such religious \\"cleansing\\" in 1492 but the more \\"openminded\\" Portuguese were a little slower in implementing these Draconian acts. Leading up to the story is the fact that Jews had already been rounded up by the Portuguese authorities and either banished or force to recant (those who recanted became known as \\"New Christians\\"). Many chose to die rather than recant, of course. This novel recounts these last few days leading up to the massacre. Berekiah's uncle Abraham, a well-known kabbalist, is found murdered and the storyline assumes a murder-mystery air, as Berekiah is determined to find who killed him. It, indeed, is a complex line. The young man is determined to find the answers. His search takes him through his fellow Jews, Christians, the New Christians, and the Muslims. He has the support of his immediate family and his best friend Farid. (The irony is not lost in the fact that Farid is a deaf Muslim, also the subject of the Inquisition's cleansing of the Iberian peninsula.)The story is told from a modern day standpoint, the \\"author\\" having found theaccount in Istanbul in 1990. \\"The Last Kabbalist\\" is the first-person accounting of the story by Berekiah, who had written his memoirs after his own escape from Lisbon to where he eventually wound up in Turkey, not to be found for some 500 years! Indeed, the story is a complex one (Lisbon's \\"O Independente\\" compares it favorably with \\"The Name of the Rose.\\") and before it is finished, even a convoluted one! But no matter, the intellectual twists and turns make the novel memorable, yet at the same time, haunting. It is not a story easily forgotten.\\"The Last Kabbalist in Lisbon\\" is more than just a story of one man's escape from persecution, however severe that was. Zimler has presented us with a riveting narrative that expertly weaves the historical accounting of this tragedy to a suspense-laden story well worth the read. He has created characters of great depth; he has captured the atmosphere of the time; and he has evoked the emotional responses from both readers and the characters alike. The imagery he conjures is rarely paralleled. While Zimler has worked through Hebrew, Portuguese, and Spanish translations, he has completed a well-knit narrative, keeping historical accuracy and personal emotion in balance, and he does so intensely and passionately. His writing style is refreshing, well-paced, and unencumbered as he plays with themes of death, violence, and even love. This is a memorable book.(Billyjhobbs@tyler.net)"},{"Title":"The Last Kabbalist of Lisbon","review":"This is a honest and therefore horrible at times glimpse into Portugal in the early 16th century, amidst terrible poverty, plague and the Inquisition from the perspective of the nephew and student of a prominent Kabbalist of Lisbon. Based as it is on an actual journal which was unearthed only recently, I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Last Kabbalist of Lisbon","review":"A quick plot summary (no spoilers): The Last Kabbalist of Lisbon follows the main character, Berekiah, as he searches for his Uncle's killer. Berekiah discovers his Uncle naked body (next to a naked young woman) in the family's secret cellar after a riot breaks out and Christians begin rounding up and killing Jews (aka \\"New Christians\\" after forced conversion). The room in which Berekiah discovers his Uncle and the unknown woman, though, is locked from the inside, and there's no place for a killer to hide. With his long time friend, Berekiah sets out in search of the murder(s) while questioning his faith and the existence of God.And now the review: The mystery and story arc are pretty interesting, but the book suffers from too much detail. The details of houses, of wardrobes, of the touch of someone's skin, of sickness (and diarrhea), of complicated family ties,...and so on. There are also far to many characters (and murder suspects) to keep straight in your head, especially when their (re)appearances are separated by several chapters.I did find it interesting to read a book set in this era and region as I'm not too familiar with Portugal in general, let alone in the early 1500's. I'm also not Jewish, so I definitely learned some things about Jewish customs, but I wish I had known there was a glossary of Jewish terms in the back of the book - it definitely would have helped!Overall, I found myself confused several times because of the immense amount of detail, the many, many, many characters, and the use of Jewish terms which were not always explained. The mystery at the heart of the story, though, is very intriguing and was satisfyingly resolved in the end. The spiritual journey Berekiah takes is also interesting and thought-provoking.I can't recommend this book to everyone, but if you're interested in period pieces and appreciate a lot of detail, you'll likely enjoy this book."},{"Title":"The Last Kabbalist of Lisbon","review":"I was looking forward to reading this book because I enjoy historical mysteries like Eco's Name of the Rose and Pear's An Instance of the Fingerpost. This book was not successful, however. As history, it was a cartoon. The only bad Jews are the ones who have converted to Christianity and the only good Christians are the ones who, it turns out, are actually Jews. As far as the mystery is concerned, I found it incomprehensible. Having finished the book, I still have only the vaguest notion of who the killer is and no idea at all of the motive."},{"Title":"The Last Kabbalist of Lisbon","review":"The Last Kabbalist of Lisbon was neither a thriller, nor very educational about the history of Lisbon's Jews, nor was it very much about kabbalah. Rather, it scratched the surface of all three. My advice is, read a book about kabbalah, a book about the History of Jews in Europe, and a book by Agatha Christie or someone. While it might take you three times as long to get through the books, one would learn 10 times as much. Dont get me wrong, The Last Kabbalist is not garbage, but you wont find yourself thinking about the story while day dreaming on the elevator."},{"Title":"The Last Kabbalist of Lisbon","review":"This was a book with a frightful prediction. What happened in the 15th and 16th centuries could be expected to happen in the 22nd century. Evangelicism could take over and a new pogram will happen. Allerts your scenses to a real but underground world about you."},{"Title":"The Last Kabbalist of Lisbon","review":"Pros: A good historical and mystery novel teinted by the threat and blood of religious persecutions. Full of emotions, colors and parfums, one can picture, if not yet known the sepharadic world.Cons: The constraints of the initial manuscript itself which chalenged as much the writer as his readers (who can sometimes loose track). The end is pending, and doesn't really makes sense.Conclusion: The curiosity makes us want to read the original document, but this would take away the fiction from the story."},{"Title":"The Last Kabbalist of Lisbon","review":"Just completed the Last Kabbalist of Lisbon and though fascinated with the history I found it a rather confusing who -done-it and why?

Page after page turned corners in the plot and the way that Zimler can couple Kabbala with the historical setting of this novel is marvellous."},{"Title":"The Last Kabbalist of Lisbon","review":"I made it all the way through this novel, but in general it requires too much effort from the reader. There are too many characters and -- especially -- too many plot twists to keep track of. If I'm going to expend this much mental effort on a novel, it had better be a classic worthy of that effort. This novel is not such a book."},{"Title":"The Last Kabbalist of Lisbon","review":"THIS IS MY FIRST READ BY THE AUTHOR AND MY FIRST READ ON THE SUBJECT AND I FOUND IT TO BE EXHILERATING. THE PROSE WAS A BIT AWKWARD AT FIRST; IT TOOK A LITTLE WHILE TO GET USED TO, BUT THEN NO PROBLEM. (SOMEONE ELSE MENTIONED THE ODD EXPRESSION &quot;GIFTED&quot; USED THROUGHOUT THE BOOK. I TOO HAD A DIFFICULT TIME WITH IT. THAT'S NOT A GAME BREAKER THOUGH.)THE STORY WILL SURELY KEEP YOU TURNING THE PAGE AND GUESSING ALL THE WAY THROUGH.IT ALSO MADE ME FEEL LIKE I WAS IN INQUISITION-ERA PORTUGAL EXPERIENCING THE EVENTS PERSONALLY. EXCEPTIONALLY WELL WRITTEN IN THAT REGARD. FOR ANYONE INTERESTED IN INQUISITION PERIOD LITERATURE, NOT TO MENTION SEPHARDIC/KABBALIST SUBJECT-MATTER LITERATURE, THIS A WONDERFUL READ.

IT'S GREAT!"},{"Title":"The Last Kabbalist of Lisbon","review":"I recently had the wonderful experience of travelling to Portugal. To kill time on the plane and other down periods during the trip, I brought this book along with me. I really enjoyed being in Portugal, in Lisbon and Sintra, while reading this book. The combination of the setting and the authors historical description was great. However, the actual story took second fiddle. The mystery was OK. So anyone interested in a good period peace, a good fictional description of what happened to the Jews of Portugal will enjoy this book. Lovers of a good mystery will find the book OK."},{"Title":"The Last Kabbalist of Lisbon","review":"If the histororical intrigue doesn't keep the pages turning (and have you checking some of the authors sources); if the religious tightrope isn't taunt and narrow enough for you; if the mystery itself doesn't at least make you head for the back page faster than you should... I'd be suprised. Excellent work! Much more enjoyable and much more \\"historic\\" than The DaVinci Code or Angels and Demons. None of Brown's \\"hidden agenda\\" stuff either. You can either account this author's historical take as fully valid or not, but you're going to have to do some REAL history research to get there. Historical fiction is much more enjoyable when its not being squished out of murky controversy and alterior motive, and The Last Kabblist is a perfect blend of pacing, mystery and oh so much more!"},{"Title":"The Last Kabbalist of Lisbon","review":"Reading Richard Zimler's book The Last Kabbalist of Lisbon is similar in a way to looking at a painting by the Flemish painter Hironymous Bosch: both have many-layered, complex compositions, full of mysterious sometimes gory details yet one can not stop looking /reading them. No wonder the author himself referred in passing, to a painting by Bosch glanced upon by Berekiah and his friend Farid in one of the city's palaces.I was fascinated not only by the main story itself ascending way beyond a regular murder mystery, but also by it's frame tale - namely, the discovery of Zarco's manuscript by Zimler back in 1990 in Istanbul. Yet, one can not but recall the words of Golden-Age Spanish-Jewish poet Solomon Ibn-Gabirol who wrote: \\"The poem's best - is its fiction\\", and that much can apply to this book, by the time you reach the middle of it, it no longer matters whether back in 1990 Zimler actually stayed in Istanbul, found Zarco's manuscript and edited it into contemporary fiction, to be published about a decade later. If indeed these facts are true and not mere fiction - than the world has been blessed with an important discovery of an illuminating historical document that sheds more light on the grim events that took place during 1506 in Lisbon.But surely this is not the main point behind this amazing, captivating and touching narrative.What, then is Zimler's bottom-line?Might it be a warning to Jews all over the world that no place is indeed safe for them in the long run? After all it can not be a mere coincidence that in 1530 Zarco warns his future readers about further wrong-doings towards the Jews of Europe, be it in during his life-time or hundreds of years later - (1930- for instance). One can not help but notice how the graphic descriptions of the massacre of the Anusim during Passover of 1506, connotes in a powerful and disturbing parallels to similar events recounted after the late 19th century pogroms in East Europe as well as after the Holocaust.Still, this book was not written only for a public well versed in Historia Judaica,therefore I tend to believe Zimler aimed to reach a higher, more spiritual level of awareness in his reader, pointing out that the real issue here is all about living without masks, telling us between the lines, that a person can only be complete if he lives his life in a place where he is accepted as he really is - be it a Jew or a Muslim, straight or gay."},{"Title":"The Last Kabbalist of Lisbon","review":"It's difficult for me to express just how much I adored this book. I picked it up intending to read a couple chapters in the tub before going to bed early (11pm). I ended reading until the water was cold and my room mates banged on the door. I finished at 1am, and wanted to reread it for more detail.This book is amazing. It's captivating and exciting, making you want to devour the text in big gulps. Putting this down for longer than a half hour is painful because you want to know more. The loose ends are not neatly tied up at the end of each chapter, nor at the end, which is wonderful. I hate it when an author ties up the story with a neat little bow, when in reality that never happpens.The book operates on several levels, which are all mingled together. On the one hand, it's a historical novel about Jews in Portugal, anti-semitism, forced conversion, reactions to the plague, kabbalah, and bonds of friendship and blood. It also deals with the masks that people wear in varying social situations, and losing yourself in those masks. Jewish religious practice and the Kaballah are, not surpisingly, very important to how the mystery plays itself out. Then there is the murder mystery, friends and family lost and feared dead, and stolen property. I'm making this sound too heavy, but Zimler keeps all those balls in the air, and doesn't ram his opinions down our throat.This novel isn't only for Jews or mystery fans. It's a brilliant work of fiction that most anyone would love. Buy a copy for yourself, and a copy to give away."},{"Title":"The Last Kabbalist of Lisbon","review":"This book was so powerful. I really enjoyed what the author did with this book. After a seredipitous find of a genizah in his friend's basement, he creates this phenomenal story--weaving elements of history, religion, mystery, and tragedy.Berekiah is a secret Jew in 16th century Portugal. His family professed that they converted and were \\"New Christians\\" after 1492, but they continued their Jewish customs and traditions. When his world is turned upside down by the death of his beloved uncle, Berekiah sets out to find the murderer. With the \\"Old Christians\\" marauding the streets of Lisbon, killing many Jews and plundering their possessions, Berekiah and his best friend, Farid, search for answers. Only someone who intimately knew Uncle Abraham could have killed him, and Berekiah searches for the killer amongst his own friends and loved ones, the inner circle of \\"threshers\\", fellow secret Jews that studied Kabbalah with his uncle.Berekiah tells the story in first person narrative, and I felt that we were not able to learn very much about him because of this. We learn more about his family and the inner circle of threshers than we do about him. The story is also told in present tense, so it is very easy to get steeped and feel like you are right there with Berekiah and Farid.I enjoyed this book very much and I learned a great deal about Marrano history."},{"Title":"The Last Kabbalist of Lisbon","review":"The inquisition came to Portugal later than it did to Spain. Jews were not tossed out of Lisbon as they were out of Madrid. Not right away. Prior to exile there was a period of &quot; grace &quot;, in which the Jews were given twenty years to completely convert to Chrisitianity. This period was characterized by pogroms, by terror, by ostracism and prejudice. In Lisbon as well as in Madrid (as in Germany some years later) Jews who had been valued members of a community rapidly became oppressed, feared, and despised. In a time of drought and plague, it was easy to blame the Jews, and also easy to burn them in huge bonfires, even those Jews who had converted to Christianity. Many secretly remained Jews, practicing their religion, and many of those who practiced studied Kabala, which is one of the roots of neo-platonism, and of the renaissance, and the source of a rich mystic tradition that continues to this day. Richard Zimmler's book is a wonderfully rich depiction of these terrible times. It is also a thrilling mystery, and an adventure story of the first order. And on every page, unobtrusively, without rancor, pretension, or arrogance, it meditates on the hard questions of life: how can GD tolerate a world of such cruelty; how can a world of such cruelty shine with such beauty; why is the world so constantly in need of redemption, and how is it that simple kindness and the complex passion for truth redeem it over and over again at every moment? Books, brothers, fathers and wives, masters and disciples, artists and thieves, murderers and schlemiels, illuminated manuscripts and minds illuminated by winged visions; all these things fill this book with unceasing interest and beauty. No wonder it's out of print."},{"Title":"The Last Kabbalist of Lisbon","review":"A columnist's praise in the June 9, 2000, issue of the Mexico City newspaper Excelsior alerted me to &quot;The Last Kabbalist of Lisbon,&quot; and I bought a copy. I found the plot delightfully engaging; it was hard to put the book down. Zimler's portrait of Lisbon in 1506, with Jews being killed by the Christian majority, is vividly drawn. And it appears to be historically accurate: the Encyclopdia Britannica confirms that there was a massacre of Jews in Lisbon that year. Reading the novel, you're in the center of a pogrom, and it's not pleasant. Zimler's portrayal of life under siege is an accomplishment in itself, but to interweave it with a well-constructed detective story is even more remarkable. The next time I'm in Lisbon, I'll walk through the Rossio and the Alfama with a more informed perspective.In sum, I highly recommend this novel. I have a few criticisms. The novel tends to portray Lisbon's Christians as haggard savages, literally cretins (a pejorative word derived from the Latin for Christian). Zimler's vehemence in this regard surprised me. And the self-righteousness of his hero, Berekiah Zarco, becomes hard to take at times, particularly when it's combined with an intrepidity that Batman and Robin might envy. Moreover, I agree with the June 7, 2000, posting that the regular invocation of a verb &quot;to gift&quot; was irritating and distracting. (The word &quot;center&quot; was also occasionally used in odd ways, but &quot;gift&quot; was particularly grating.) I know of nothing in Portuguese that requires such usage.I wondered whether the supposedly nonfictional author's note was a literary device or a statement of historical fact. I think I've been able to figure out which it is, but the author may not want the answer posted here, so I'm not going to gift (I mean give) my opinion. Let it be part of the mystery."},{"Title":"The Last Kabbalist of Lisbon","review":"Without a doubt this is one of the finest literary whodunnits written in recent years. Though to call it a 'whodunnit' automatically puts it into that subclass of murder thrillers and it is far superior to those. It failed to meet my expectations, and this has nothing whatsoever to do with the book or the author, because of the publishing gump. The Arcadia version B format has a review on the back that screams: \\"an American Umberto Eco\\".And so raises expectations to unscalable heights.To draw a parallel, it's akin to those fantasy novel reviewers who proclaim the next trite offering as 'surpassing' or 'the new' Tolkien. Talk about setting an author up for a fall.So, this is not on the same level as Eco. In fact, there is nothing out there to come close to Eco, so forget the reviews and recognise that this is a brilliantly characterised, superbly plotted literary murder mystery set in 1506 against the backdrop of the persecution of the New Christians. Zimmer makes one slip - he introduces our erstwhile detective - Berekiah/Pedro - to a sidekick. If only we could get away from sidekicks!Nevertheless the plot, the scene and the intensity of the writing does mean this is the finest intellectual murder mystery of the twenty-first century.But it is not an Eco."},{"Title":"The Last Kabbalist of Lisbon","review":"\\"The last kabbalist of Lisbon\\" is a man named Berekiah Zarco, a jew living in Lisbon in the beginning of the 16th century. During that year's Passover celebration, the christian population in Lisbon revolted against the jews, and many atrocities were commited. Zarco's uncle, Abraham, a powerful jew and kabbalist, was involved in many irregular activities. During the riots, Berekiah's life is turned upside down, and, among other things, his beloved uncle is murdered, under mysterious circumstances.Richard Zimler has created a novel based in many layers, characters and situations. Sometimes a little confusing, but always interesting, Zimler guides us since his discovery of the hidden documents written by Zarco centuries ago, to his misfortunes while trying to find his uncle's murderer. The violence contained in the novel is purposedly very graphic, so that the reader can relate to what happened during the period. Most of his characters are complex, but, even if the story is narrated in first person, I felt detached from Berekiah, the main character, paying attention to other characters, more interesting in my opinion.Zimler has written a story that is really a \\"whodunnit\\", mixed with the fictional account of one of the most unhappy times in human history. I liked it and recommend it, although it is a little too dense to become \\"popular\\".Grade 8.0/10"},{"Title":"The Last Kabbalist of Lisbon","review":"You will not only find that this book is full of surprises and horrifying (yet histotically accurate) events, you'll find yourself engrossed into the mystery that makes up the plot of the novel.Yes, it's graphic and down-right disgusting to learn of the tragedies faced by the Jews and Jewish converts of 17th century Portugal, but the perplexing mystery that grows and wanes by discoveries throughout the book will prevent you from setting this book down for any lengthy amount of time."},{"Title":"The Last Kabbalist of Lisbon","review":"This book has some amazingly disgusting scenes that are described during the pogrom of the Jewish settlement in Lisbon. Disturbingly, these scenes only make the book that much more interesting and engrossing. The book is a wonderful novel set in an incredible time period. One interesting feature is the change in tense from past to present about halfway through the book. The reader can't help but feel the madness that consumes the protagonist as his obsession to find his Uncle's killer leads him on a maddeningly winding trail. Besides having a great plot line this novel also has the benefit of giving an insight into Kabbalah, a fascinating movement. Readers of mystery and students of religion will relish the experience of reading this fine work."},{"Title":"The Last Kabbalist of Lisbon","review":"The Last Kabbalist of Lisbon by Richard Zimler is a treasure box of a book, filled with gems of beautiful writing, philosophical questions, and contemplations on right and wrong, love and betrayal. The story begins with the author renting an old house in Istanbul, and discovering a hidden room containing rare, beautifully illuminated Jewish manuscripts from the 1500's written by an illuminator, Berekiah Zarco. The author translates the books, and Zarco's story unfolds:He was a young Jew boy caught up in the Lisbon during the infamous massacre of the Jewish in 1506. During these horrific events, when the world is turned upside down for him, someone kills his beloved uncle. It falls to him to solve the mystery of his uncle's murder against the backdrop of the pogrom taking place around him.The story is captivating, the setting is atmospheric & authentic, the myriad characters are all complex, real characters, and the writing is exquisite. If that is not enough, the story raises questions about human nature, good and evil, religion, tolerance, love and hate -- everything that is important is discussed in this book in a thoughtful, thought-provoking way. So highly recommended that I went out and got a second copy of the book so that I could lend it without giving up my own copy."},{"Title":"The Last Kabbalist of Lisbon","review":"The circumstances in which Richard Zimler, the twentieth-century translator/redactor of this work, found the sixteenth-century manuscripts on which the book is based are as unique as this opportunity for us to read the eye-witness accounts of a secret Jew in Portugal during the era of anti-Jewish hysteria following the forced conversions of Jews in 1496-1497. As a Kabbalist, the narrator is constantly reflecting upon the possible meaning of the events which surround him. Like his ancestors who lived through the Golden Age of Jewish Iberia, the narrator selects stunningly beautiful metaphors to describe things he sees. History is brought alive, in detail that may verge on being too realistic for some. Yet the narration never dwells; it moves at an intense pace as the protagonist quests for knowledge and information. Almost too incredible to be true, the words are so insightful and detailed that they cannot be doubted on the whole. Zimler's ability to bring a haphazard collection of manuscripts to life and reawaken their author's most intimate voice must not go unacknowledged either. I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"The Last Kabbalist of Lisbon","review":"The Last Kabbalist of Lisbon is not only a very well written history of the Jewish community in those years, but also the insight into a man's mind and fears.

I have read many fictional accounts of the Inquisition in Portugal, and I am always moved by the suffering of the Jews who lived during this terrible time. Zimler's book starts out well. I found the characters, especially Abraham Zarco (brilliant mystic, manuscript illuminator and leader of his community) fascinating. Twenty-year-old Berekiah Zarco, Abraham's nephew, is an enthusiastic and vivid narrator. However, after Berekiah stops being an observer and starts becoming a sleuth, the book loses its momentum. In a repetitious series of vignettes, Berekiah wanders around the neighborhood interviewing a variety of people, as he tries to find out who murdered his uncle. Zimler presents us with a dizzying array of characters who flow in and out of the novel. After a while, I lost track of the characters and I lost interest, as well. What a shame, since Zimler does have a gift for describing this horrible chapter in the history of European Jewry."},{"Title":"The Last Kabbalist of Lisbon","review":"Much of what I read may be described as a light snack: briefly satisfying, pleasant flavour, but gone almost instantly.Anything by John Grisham, for instance, would be as satisfying as a thin gruel. James Patterson - perhaps one-third of a broken piece of a potato chip?Bernard Cornwell: a hearty meat and potato read; something that sticks to the ribs.The Last Kabbalist of Lisbon: a superb five course gourmet meal, with more trimmings than a festive turkey.Let's start with the hors d'oeuvres. Tapas, I think: varied, sharp. And that's Zimler's writing - fine, scalpel-sharp. This book is a pleasure to read, and would be even if it was a treatise on suet making. Zimler is an elegant writer. Bravo!Then the soup. Ah, yes: a hearty beef broth, rich and satisfying... these are the characters. Each one lives on the pages, and makes him or herself known to the reader in a multi-layered, many-faceted way. The characters peopling this book are real.Main course - An exquisite Paella (OK. I know I'm in Spain with the meal, rather than Portugal, but there is a fair bit of cross-over. Thanks for the lee-way.) Something that's complex, yet simple. Something with a number of ingredients, held together with one main theme. That's the Kabbalist's plot. A joy to read, a pleasure to experience.Dessert is a light sorbet.. and that's the physical feel of the book. My edition is beautifully bound, and simply feels good in the hand.Port and cigars, anyone? Because this is a meal which will last. I read The Last Kabbalist of Lisbon nearly a year ago - and every now and then the sting of Lisbon's dust and smoke invades my nostrils, and reminds me that I have enjoyed a sumptuous meal... and truly memorable book.Thankyou, Mr Zimler."},{"Title":"The Last Kabbalist of Lisbon","review":"Richard Zimler is a Professor of Journalism at the University of Porto in Porto, Portugal. The Last Kabbalist Of Lisbon, his first book, was originally published in 1996 and was a smash. Now in its fourth edition, it has been published in several European countries and Brazil. Ferdinand and Isabella of Spain attempted to expel all Jews from their homeland in 1496 by forced conversion to Christianity. Many Jews committed suicide rather than convert; some converted and practiced their Jewish religion in secret. The Last Kabbalist Of Lisbon is based upon the finding of a manuscript in the home of Ayaz Lugo by the author in 1990. The manuscript was written by Berekiah Zarco, a young Kabbalist who finds his Uncle Abraham, a renowned Kabbalist, and author murdered with a young woman in the secret cellar used by their threshing group. Nine of Zarco's manuscripts were found; six regarding the Kabbalist mystical philosophy and three secular manuscripts, one of which tells this story. Why were the manuscripts hidden? Zimler proposes many theories: &quot;As to their hiding place, very possibly all the manuscripts were sealed up to protect them during the Nazi period; the cement casing dates from this era. It must be remembered that Portuguese New Christians did indeed emigrate in mass numbers during the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries, primarily to Turkey, Greece, North Africa, the Netherlands and Italy, areas later threatened or overrun by the German Reich.&quot; The Last Kabbalist Of Lisbon is a profoundly disturbing mystery of murder and betrayal. Berekiah Zarco has a complicated mission: to solve the murder of his Uncle, save his family from the marauding Christians, and to act as the voice and, perhaps, savior of the kabbalists of Lisbon. Berekiah's is but a boy, but his keen intelligence, mystical visions, and sleuthing abilities outsmart the actions of a world he can no longer trust. This tale recounts a period we can hardly understand, but Zimler succeeds. The Last Kabbalist Of Lisbon is a gift for all of mankind.Shelly Glodowski Reviewer"},{"Title":"The Last Kabbalist of Lisbon","review":"Last night I attended a slide presentation about the history of Portuguese Jews. There was a slide of a painting showing the burning of Jews in front of a large cathedral in Lisbon. I could &quot;know&quot; how this must have been because I had read this book. &quot;An Instance of the Fingerpost&quot; is not nearly as good a mystery. I liked that one for its masterful inclusion of all of the famous people I had ever heard of at that time in England combined with the description of life in Oxford. But that book was not the page-turner that this one was. I thought this was just as good a description of life at the time and a much better mystery."},{"Title":"The Last Kabbalist of Lisbon","review":"If you are a fan of well-written historical fiction, I cannot recommend this book highly enough. It brings together all the elements of a great mystery while recreating the historical context of sixteenth-century Lisbon, the increasingingly intolerant attitude taken by the Church towards the Jews as millenial fever started to take hold, and the adjustments that Jews made as they sought to occupy a liminal space in which they were protected de jure but were incredibly vulnerable de facto. As a historian who has studied this time period extensively, I would like to congratulate the author on his research and his talent at turning that research into a creative work. It's a hell of a read. If the author is interested in a further dialogue with me, I would welcome the opportunity to write to him personally."},{"Title":"Three Worlds Gone Mad: Dangerous Journeys through the War Zones of Africa, Asia, and the South Pacific","review":"where are the pictures? He goes to all these places, meets all these different personalities, admits that he has a camera and where are they? Now I don't need pictures in a book for me to read it but his stories I think would be enhanced with photos of his journeys.The book is good and is part adventure/travel/survival/third world political science. In his travels, Mr. Pelton does not seem to take any easy route to go anywhere. He gets smuggled into Chechnya and tracks down a rebel leader on his own choice. The rebels who are known for kidnapping foriegners and journalists are meanwhile being tracked and bombed by the Russian military. He goes to Bougainville when everyone including the people that live there tell him not too. Why? I think because as he feels that there is a story to tell and it usually is not the \\"popular\\" one fed to most news agencies. Case in point is his Chechnya visit, where again he chooses to go to the \\"terrorists\\", not to give them a voice, but to get the unpopular side of the story (especially when considering the lack of freedom of the press in Russia). It is an objective look at the history of the Chechnya/Russian relationship and the situation where atrocities are seem to be committed by both sides. He even \\"interviews\\" a captured Russian soldier whose handlers casually tell Mr. Pelton he will most likely be executed the next day. The part on Sierra Leone is equally impressive, probably because there has been more press about the atrocities and violence there.So as long as Mr. Pelton feels the need to travel to different \\"worlds gone mad\\", writing the about the lesser known histories and/or conflicts, he will most likely have me as a reader of his books."},{"Title":"Three Worlds Gone Mad: Dangerous Journeys through the War Zones of Africa, Asia, and the South Pacific","review":"Robert Young Pelton is easily my favourite writer. He could write or talk about what he ate for breakfast and I would probably love it. I own all of his books and although a few of them have the same stories, I still read them and loved them. No joke, this guy is my hero. If you want the straight story on some of the world's nastiest conflicts by a man who actuall GOES there, meets with all of the people who are actually involved, and tells their side of the story without any b.s. then this is your guy. Both Liberals and Conservatives love this guy and I bet he doesn't care either way. He just wants to tell the world what he sees."},{"Title":"Three Worlds Gone Mad: Dangerous Journeys through the War Zones of Africa, Asia, and the South Pacific","review":"Another great book by Robert Young Pelton. There's something deeply wrong with this guy going to Chechnya like that, but he gives a great feel of what's going on there at street level, as well as some enlightening history that very few of us have any clue about. The Sierra Leone section tells of that area after things began to settle a little. While much has been written about the wars there and the diamond industry this book really adds a dimension to the Sierra Leone picture for me. As for Bougainville, all I knew was that there was a war there, but had never learned anything about it.Like all of RYP's books this is a great read and well worth the money."},{"Title":"Three Worlds Gone Mad: Dangerous Journeys through the War Zones of Africa, Asia, and the South Pacific","review":"I've read everything he has out.

They are Sierra Leone, Chechneya, and Bouganville (part of Papua New Guinea). I have traveled widely and even visited some of Pelton's own 100 dangerous places, but I don't think I would travel to these destinations. The author shows the terror of the RUF, and describes the mercenaries of Executive Outcomes. In Chechneya, he shows the terror of the scorthed earth policy of the Russians in their desire to conquer the breakaway province. In Bouganville, he shows how an out of touch government has taken liberties with a remote province. In all three, precious minerals are being exploited for the benefit of an elite. They are diamonds, oil, and copper.I don't know if I agree completely with all the author states. He relays quite a bit of the mercenaries tales, but these are soldiers of fortune who do not have the local population's interests at heart. In regards to the Chechens, I don't believe the Russians killed their own people to stage a conquest of this province. This is interesting reading, and it gives one man's perspectives."},{"Title":"Three Worlds Gone Mad: Dangerous Journeys through the War Zones of Africa, Asia, and the South Pacific","review":"Not exactly LP, but it tells stories of two places that beenextremely dangerous and one that still is.in SL conflict(the hunter) was fuelled by greed, diamonds made many Lebanese come to SL andthe become rich on trading, MEA (middle east airlines) flewin several of their big passenger planes to rescue it's citizens, SLisn't a tourist resort nowadays like The Gambia today, butstill not extremely dangerous.Bougainville (the Heaven) was Oz mining company property until the fightingdrove them of the island, PNG gov tried to recruit SA mercs to&quot;conquer&quot; the island and start mining again, but it failed badly.Chechenya (the Hammer) was also about greed, in this case oil-pipelines fromAzerbadjian.

Less polemical than most of his better known works, it is an in-depth exploration of classical economics, and as such, I would generally recommend it only to those who are already fans of Bastiat or who have a solid grounding in economics. Intended to be his magnum opus, Bastiat died before its completion; as a result, the book is really only two-thirds complete. This is the reason for my having rated it just an &quot;8&quot;.

Williams was barred by wartime security regulations from telling the whole story at first publication; subsequent editions have added more detail.Williams and two companions came up with a clever device to fool their German captors: a wooden vaulting horse whose daily placement in the prison yard allowed access to a concealed escape tunnel entrance. The escapers took months to dig under the wire encircling the camp, evading German security. However, in Williams' enthralling account, breaking out of the camp was the easy part. The escapees would have to make their way across wartime Germany, hoping to reach a Baltic port and find a way to neutral Sweden.\\"The Wooden Horse\\" is rich in the details of camp life in Stalag-Luft III, as the prisoners cope with hunger, cold, boredom, and German restrictions while trying to a way home. Williams documents their courage, compassion, and humor, along with some astonishing improvisations in the way of escape attempts. \\"The Wooden Horse\\" is a classic of escape literature, and highly recommended to students of the escape and evade genre."},{"Title":"The Wooden Horse (Laurel Leaf Library)","review":"POW escape stories are almost always inspiring, and \\"The Wooden Horse\\" is no exception. For the most part, it is relatively well-written, but it still has two major flaws.The first is that the story of the third escapee is so abbreviated that it feels like it is entirely missing. When they exit the POW camp, he seems tovanish into thin air. He doesn't make his reappearance until the final pages. Supposedly, he made it into Sweden without a hitch, but I still can't believe he didn't experience any tense moments, or make any interesting observations. Williams could have interviewed him and given him at least one chapter. The whole thing is more striking because the book is narrated in the third person.The second problem is that some scenes feel overly fictionalized. In particular, there is lots of dialogue which is questionable. Some of it may even improve the story, but overall I think it mostly detracts from the story. I begin to doubt later scenes. Is the character of Larensen ( a sympathetic but rollicking drunk Swede who speaks English too loudly) real, or is he just comic relief? And later on, did they really pull such a stupid gambit on the bridge guard? (I won't give it away, though it is cliched) Shooting him with a Browning would likely have been quieter.Despite all, \\"the Wooden Horse\\" is fairly enjoyable, though I would still rank this behind Brickhill's \\"The Great Escape\\" (1) and Reid's \\"The Colditz Story\\" (2)."},{"Title":"The Wooden Horse (Laurel Leaf Library)","review":"I read this book 51 years ago!

Here's the story of a daring escape during World War II in an expanded, revised edition that tells of a break from one of Germany's most escape-proof camps. The account doesn't just tell how they did it - it covers the aftermath of the break-out, which involved getting out of Germany entirely.

You can also easily pick it up through Amazons second hand bookstores for a relatively cheap price.Written by the escapee himself, it retains all its charm and spirit since it first received rave reviews in the late 1940s to early 1950s.The breakout came from a novel, yet brilliant idea inspired by the Legend of the Trojan Horse- ie to use a gym vaulting horse as cover to hide an inmate who dug a tunnel to the nearest concentration camp fence. It succeeded, but I won't ruin the story with all the details, you will have to read it yourself! Rest assured the book is well written, and as it is told by one of the escapees himself it has a certain charm, readability and authenticity about it.Getting out was just the first part, the escapees still had to travel across most of Germany to reach home, right amidst the heartlessness and desparation of WW2. I found the description of the lives of everyday German people within a major war as soulful, revealing and harrowing as the concentration camp itself.A remarkable story, a great and uplifting novel, sure to inspire for many years to come. No mundane &quot;political correctness&quot; here, truthfully told and recorded with all the desperation, fear, and courageous spirit of many involved in the war-on both sides.There was a film also made in the 1960s I think, which was almost as good as the book, but not quite. Of similar genre to The Wooden Horse is &quot;the Great Escape&quot;, also made into a film, but the Wooden Horse is more realisitic and better done overall in my opinion.Uplifts the spirit."},{"Title":"The Wooden Horse (Laurel Leaf Library)","review":"This amazing escape episode involved three men, and was not part of the much-publicized Great Escape, but took place from the same camp (Stalag Luft III). This review is an expansion of an earlier one that I had written.The original Trojan Horse contained soldiers in the process of sneaking into a city. This real-life WWII thriller describes a Trojan Horse used by Allied POWs to tunnel their way out of a German POW camp. While the horse was ostensibly being used for vaulting exercise, a small group of men hidden within the horse dug a tunnel underneath. Eventually it led them to freedom. Years later, \\"Eric Williams\\" was surprised that a mere plywood box could have fooled the Germans for so long. Indeed, the Germans apparently never became suspicious of the fact that the horse was always placed at the identical location, and not far from the wire.The idea was conceived out of the frustration of digging tunnels long distances from the huts to past the camp wire, and the Germans expecting the traps to originate from the huts and finding them. What if there was some way to get much closer to the wire, to dig a tunnel from there, and to conceal the trap from that unexpected location?The Trojan Horse episode came to mind. It would be a long and laborious tunneling process, as only a few tunnelers and relatively small amounts of sand could be concealed within the horse per exercise session. Otherwise, the horse would be too heavy to be carried.The vaulting horse was at first used without any tunnelers concealed in it. In fact, the vaulters purposely knocked it over a number of times so that the Germans would see nothing on the inside of it. The Germans were told that the vaulting stemmed from the English craze for exercise.After innumerable episodes of vaulting and tunneling, the tunnel was past the wire. Three escapees went from inside the horse down the tunnel, and, after many hours, dug there way to freedom. All three made it safely to the Allied lines."},{"Title":"The Wooden Horse (Laurel Leaf Library)","review":"A Gripping True WWII POW Escape Story!!This book took me over until the very last page.I usually don't care for reading as a past time and especially novels that take too long to get through.I read this book over 20 years ago (and only did so by chance after finding it in the school library), because I had to submit a book report during my junior high school years.I enjoyed the book so much I eagery and ultimately compiled a great book report and was awarded 9/10 as a grade.Funny enough, I did so well with it that I took the liberty to re-submitted the same book report the following year and again was awarded another high mark (of course it was a different teacher and I had to re-write and date it).In fact here I am over 20 years later I plan to get my very own copy.

In fact, I think that I enjoyed this one the most out of the three, although I recommend reading the whole series in order to get the most out of Catton's writing.In this book, Catton covers the last two years of the war (after Grant takes command), ending with the Confederate surrender at Appomattox. Catton's writing is captivating and revealing as he tells the story of how the Civil War became a brutal fight between two determined sides. Both of them willing to fight until the bitter end, and determined not to yield. The battlefield descriptions from the overland campaign are riveting. You truly get a sense of the horror the common soldier (and young officers) faced during this brutal fights.Once again, Catton's prose is engaging and insightful. He tells numerous stories from the point of view of the common soldier in order to give the reader a sense of what is might have been like to fight in the Civil War. Also, his descriptions of General Grant, Sheridan, and Meade reveal a lot about the character and personality of the men who lead the Union Army to victory.I highly recommend this book (and the entire trilogy) to anyone interested in the Civil War. If you have not read much about the Union Army, this trilogy is a great starting point. I have been reading a decent amount about the Civil War the past few years, and nothing I have read truly surpasses this series. Enjoy."},{"Title":"A Stillness At Appomattox","review":"On the inside cover of this book is my father's name and the notation that this was a Christmas present to him in 1962. Along with this book came the other two in the trilogy. I haven't read the books in many a year, and it has been a pleasure reacquainting myself with these volumes.Bruce Catton was a good historian, but it is writing that really sets his works off. In a few paragraphs, he can describe a general or some other person in such a manner as to make the reader feel that he or she has learned something about that individual. And he creates pictures with his words. One example that I have remembered over the years (well, not word for word, but fairly close) is the description of Grant, at Appomattox, beginning his journey to meet with Robert E. Lee. The lines (Page 380): \\"Down by the roadside near Appomattox Court House, Sheridan and Ord and other officers sat and waited while a brown-haired little man in a mud-splattered uniform rode up. They all saluted him, and there was a quiet interchange of greetings, and then General Grant tilted his head toward the village and asked: 'Is General Lee up there?'\\"The book begins with the story of General Judson Kilpatrick (called \\"Kill Cavalry\\" by many for his willingness to take chances with his troops) trying to sell a plan for a raid on Richmond; the book ends with Grant riding to meet Lee.This is the story, then, of the final segment of the war, when Grant began a relentless campaign against the Army of Northern Virginia. Grant was not so much interested in Richmond as he was in taking Lee's army out of the war. Catton's powerful narrative focuses as much on the men in the Army of the Potomac as on its generals, giving a human dimension to this work. This work is, in that sense, akin to Shelby Foote's multi-volume series on the Civil War, in which he applied his own literary skills to make his history so readable and in which he humanized the conflict by many anecdotes focusing on the troops themselves.The first part of the book notes the Army getting used to Grant. The Union soldiers had become somewhat jaded by this time with its commanding generals. So, it was \\"wait and see\\" with Grant. The moment when they came to see him as the relentless warrior was at the close of the battle at the Wilderness. Other generals would have retreated to refit and prepare a new campaign. But Grant was unlike the other generals. The result (Page 92): \\". . .as [Sedgwick's men] reached that fatal crossroads the veterans knew how the land lay and knew that if they took the left-hand fork they would be retreating and if they turned to the right they would be going for another fight. The column turned right. . .[and there was] a lifting of the gloom.\\"The heavy fighting as Grant inexorably moved forward is, indeed, well told. The book holds up well over half a century since the original version was published. One wonders what an updated volume would be like as more information has become available with the years. What would Catton have done? No answer is possible, but we do know what he did with the material available to him. There are cavils here and there, stories that may well be a bit mistaken. But this is still well worth reading."},{"Title":"A Stillness At Appomattox","review":"The books were just what I needed.

The book is one of several superbly readable volumes on the Civil War by author/historian Bruce Catton (1899-1978).This narrative covers the Army of the Potomac from the start of the brutal 1864 wilderness campaign through the war's end a year later at Appomattox. The author shows that General Ulysses S. Grant was more capable than brilliant, and fiercely determined to keep the pressure on General Lee's rebel army until the Confederates had no choice but to quit. Given the Union's advantage in men and material, the strategy made sense. What was less sensible were costly errors by Union officers, frightful casualties, and a sickening Union failure to clinch victory on the first day at Petersburg (thus reducing carnage on both sides).The author perused many soldier diaries and letters to show us the life of the average Union enlisted man. That soldier was well-paid ($16 a month), but forced to endure boredom, rough weather, marching, stress, and dangers from disease and a tough, determined enemy.This moving look at the last year of conflict is probably the best of Catton's narratives on the Civil War."},{"Title":"A Stillness At Appomattox","review":"Having been drawn into American Civil War reading by what has probably become a rather routine trip through Killer Angels, Gods and Generals, Cold Mt. and even Shelby Foote's Shiloh, I followed the newbie trail and &quot;discovered&quot; this gem. Obviously, Bruce Catton was at the forefront of his genre, weaving meticulously footnoted anecdotal material with insightful historical analysis using a highly literary loom. His soldier's eye view, never straying far from the man in the trench, kept me involved and identifying. And the copious footnotes, far from being arcane, assure the reader of the authenticity that is lacking in Shaara and Frazier. 20th century rewrites of the 19th century soldier's perspectives are kept to a minimum, while the real soldiers are allowed to express themselves. Thanks Bruce Catton. I can't wait to get my hands on Volumes 1 and 2!"},{"Title":"A Stillness At Appomattox","review":"Bruce Catton received the Pulitzer Prize for this final volume in his three-part History of the Army of the Potomac. Catton's greatness was that he combined historical accuracy with poetic insight, writing from the perspective of the citizen-soldiers who fought the Civil War and whom he had come to know and respect growing up in Michigan. &quot;A Stillness at Appomattox&quot; covers the last cruel year of the war, when the Army of the Potomac had become an engine of war under the leadership of Ulysses S. Grant. Although on paper the Army still belonged to George Gordon Meade, it was Grant who was the head of all the Union forces and who ran his command in the field. In this final volume Catton traces the Army's inevitable progress towards its grim victory, through the battles of the Wilderness, the Bloody Angle, Cold Harbor, the Crater, and on through the last months of the war to the moment at the MacLean house when the nation was made whole again.Like its predecessors, &quot;A Stillness at Appomattox&quot; is divided into six sections: (1) &quot;Glory Is Out of Date&quot; follows Grant as he arrives from the West to check out the Army that needs to whip Bobbie Lee; (2) &quot;Roads Leading South&quot; relates the horrors of the Battle of the Wilderness and the new mood as the Army relentless pushes South towards Richmond; (3) &quot;One More River to Cross&quot; covers the bloody mess of the final assault on Cold Harbor; (4) &quot;White Iron on the Anvil&quot; details the final hemming in of the Army of Northern Virginia into a defensive position around Richmond, including the Battle of the Crater: (5) &quot;Away, You Rolling River&quot; deals with both the Siege of Richmond and Sheridan's efforts in the Shenandoah Valley; and (6) &quot;Endless Road Ahead&quot; finally brings us to the Fall of Richmond and Lee's surrender to Grant. Catton's History of the Army of the Potomac was unique because it insisted on telling the story of the Civil War from the perspective of the fighting soldiers, creating for an entire Union army what regimental historians and the memoirs of individual soldiers had done on smaller levels.

Now that I've read it, I can see why a person might say that. Enough said, I'll leave it to you to discover, if you like, why this book might be special in that way. Saying that the writing is superb doesn't come near to doing it justice. Catton had a wonderful comprehension of what made the civil war generals and soldiers tick and was able to make his readers understand them too. This is no dusty tome about dry stick figures. Reading the book gives a feeling of being there as the action unfolds -- fuming over mistakes resulting in needless human carnage, wondering if Robert E. Lee walked on water, wincing at the sacrifices made that directly affect our lives well over a hundred years later. Unfortunately, there are absolutely no pictures (except on the cover) or maps in the book.

In other words, he was able to write a history book with the same sort of literary style you would expect to find in a novel, trait that would be a major strength of Shelby Foote as well and the impact of which can be seen in books like \\"The Killer Angels\\" as well.

The winner of the Pulitzer in 1953, this story is still fresh and energetic today, far outdistancing many other more modern accounts. Told from the Union soldier's perspective, this book isn't so much a history of battles, tactics...etc. but how the &quot;everyday&quot; soldier fit into the confrontations and how he subsequently responded to Union leadership. This volume (Vol 3 of the Army of the Potomac series) traces the War in Virginia in 1864 from the crossing of the Rapidan River for the Wilderness battle up to and including the final surrender at Appotmattox and what a story it is! Catton manges to weave the story of each engagement with just the right amount of personal and historical content that makes this very much accurate as well as incredibly readable. Nowhere can you find such elegant writing describing the horrific actions of both the Union and Confederate Armies as they battled from the Wilderness to Spotsylvania to North Anna and onto Cold Harbor in the first part of 1864. His descriptions and analysis of the battlefields and troop movements at Cold Harbor, for example, border on genius... I really felt like I knew how the Union soldiers felt and what drastic measures and portenting doom they went through preparing for and fighting this incredible battle. The subsequent movement to and siege of Petersburg is also wonderfully told with emphasis on the &quot;Crater&quot; fiasco, Fort Stedman and trench life in general... you get a true feeling of the frustration and, finally, the exhilaration that the Union soldiers and generals must have felt when the final breakthrough of the Confederate lines was achieved. Finally, the scene at Appomattox was presented in a completely different manner then I've ever read before...very little is discussed concerning Grant's and Lee's surrender actions...it's all told from the battlefield perspective and (to use a previous reviewer's words) is breathless. This &quot;Army of the Potomac&quot; series, needless to say, is very definetly essential Civil War reading with &quot;A Stillness at Appomattox&quot; the high water mark...extremely highly recommended!"},{"Title":"A Stillness At Appomattox","review":"Bruce Catton is arguably the most readable and accessible author who wrote about the civil war. Whether you are a military historian or a beginner, you will take something meaningful from his work. He writes in a beautiful, yet simple, manner and you really feel as if you are there. When he narrates Lee's surrender to Grant at Appomattox, it's as if you are sitting in the room during this pivotal moment in American history.Catton is certainly not without his biases. He is primarily a biographer of Grant and his focus is squarely on him during this book. Catton is arguably the greatest Grant biographer and is largely responsible for changing the negative views about Grant in the 1950's and 60's. He wrote several books about USG and this one weaves in and out of Grants life.Catton thoroughly understood Ulysses Grant and became his vocal proponent. He correctly grasped that Grant was the preeminent strategist of the civil war and was also the war's greatest, most innovative and most determined general. Those who errantly believe Grant won with brute force or superior numbers need to read this book. Others who espouse the line that Robert E. Lee was the real genius of the war also need to consult this volume. At its conclusion, you will change your mind and realize that Grant was not only a magnificent soldier, he was also a highly intelligent, humorous and marvelously humane man. He has been unfairly maligned and Catton sets the record straight.This is a \\"must have\\" book for anyone interested in U.S. Grant or the American civil war.

Of course, there is also the unique writing style that Catton possessed - a free flowing and smooth narrative rich with details.My only complaint is the lack of maps. However, one must also bear in mind that the first edition was written in 1953, a time when books did not have the number of detailed maps that you would find in more recent titles.Complaint aside, I highly recommend the book and series as the best coverage of the Union Army of the Potomac during the Civil War.Read and enjoy!"},{"Title":"A Stillness At Appomattox","review":"This narrative story of the final campaign of the Union armies in Virginia begins with the arrival of General Grant in the spring of 1864 and ends with Lee's surrender at Appomattox Court House in 1865.

The third volume of the Army of the Potomac trilogy gets to the human level of the war, those who served in the Union army having suffered through campaign, defeat and retreat through several leaders, came under the direction of Ulysses Grant. From his reputation in the western theater of war, Grant was very different from his predecessors such as McClellan and Hooker. The era of total war had begun in Virginia, and this book shows the horror of the Overland Campaign, through the Wilderness, Spotsylvania and Cold Harbor, then to the crossing of the James, the siege of Petersburg, and the eventual chase to Appomattox. The nature of this campaign is depicted starkly, the ambulance trains taking back the wounded from the Wilderness, the Bloody Angle at Spotsylvania with the most severe hand to hand fighting in the war, and more. The changing nature of the army is shown, with drafted &quot;bounty men&quot; who brought discredit to proud regiments, and the new war of attrition which made such units as the famed Iron Brigade dwindle.In lesser hands this book would have been readable and informative. Catton on the other hand transcends that, he writes a classic, a must read for anyone interested in this conflict.

The Union Army had won a great victory at Gettysburg, but the Confederacy was far from defeated as the war continued to rage on. While some have said that Catton takes something of a Southern viewpoint in his writings, I do not agree with this; his treatment of both sides is even-handed for all that this one is told mainly from the Northern perspective.This one is an absolute must for all Civil War enthusiasts.

RJB."},{"Title":"A Stillness At Appomattox","review":"Bruce Catton created a American Civil War masterpiece in this book. With excellent skill and verve Catton follows the key campaigns of the Army of the Potomac from 1864-1865 that helped bring the end of the war in sight. With Catton and his mesmerizing writing you will follow the Army of the Potomac into the destruction and chaos of the Overland Campaign of Virginia. The killing fields of the Wilderness, Spotsylvania, North Anna River, and Cold Harbor are brought back to horrible life. The bitter siege of Petersburg that dragged on for nine long months is sketched. Some of the most memorable passages of the book cover the disaster that was the Battle of the Crater during the Petersburg campaign. Black and white Union troops fighting together on the same side in this battle and both being horribly slaughtered. It is amazing to read how bungled this assault was. The Shenandoah Valley Campaign is also fabulously depicted. The battles of the valley from Third Winchester to Cedar Creek are really depicted well by Catton. And you will be there when Robert E. Lee and the doomed Army of Northern Virginia is brought to bay by Grant and the Army of the Potomac at Appomattox Court house.Catton's genius shines in depicting the higher officers like Ulysses Grant, George Meade, Winfield Hancock, and Philip Sheridan in a brightly humanistic and realistic way. A reader will be able to understand why and how they made their decisions. Excellent anecdotes abound on the fascinating character that was Grant. But where Catton really shines is in the discussion of the private soldier who did the fighting, killing, and dieing. His account will make you take note of the extreme bravery, humor, and courage of these men. Every branch of the service infantry, artillery, and cavalry is paid tribute too. These men (along with their Confederate opponents) were the bravest of the brave.This is epic history writing the likes we will never see again!A+++"},{"Title":"A Stillness At Appomattox","review":"\\"A Stillness at Appomattox\\" is the final volume of Bruce Catton's epic narrative history of the Army of the Potomac, that hard-luck Union Army that carried so much of the burden of the Civil War. In this third volume, Catton describes the horrors of the final year of the war.The Army of the Potomac, in 1864, had become a battle-hardened and perhaps cynical collection of long-serving veterans, bounty-men, and volunteers, in search of a man who could finish the job. That man was U.S. Grant, directing the Armies of the Union from a field headquarters co-located with that of General George Meade, nominally the commander of the Army of the Potomac. Grant's campaign in the East was to be a bloody slugfest against the highly lethal Confederate Army of Northern Virgnia of Robert E. Lee.Grant and President Lincoln understood the truth that Lee and his Army were the center of gravity of a tattered Confederacy and the harder truth that Lee's Army just might have to be bled to death to end the war. Catton's narrative follows the Army of the Potomac through a series of costly battles to a siege at Petersburg over the winter of 1864-1865, as Grant and the Army of the Potomac refused to be deterred by tactical set-backs. In the spring of 1865, the long siege at Petersburg turns into one final campaign of manuever that ends at Appomattox Courthouse.Catton's scholarship might be a bit dated, but has lost none of its ability to enthrall the reader. Catton's deft combination of campaign history and individual perspective is still fascinating. \\"A Stillness at Appomattox' is very highly recommended to students of the Civil War as a superb read."},{"Title":"A Stillness At Appomattox","review":"I'm not exactly a Civil War buff, but this was my favorite book on the genre. It captures the final days leading to the end of the war. More than any other book, it captures the hatred and horror of a conflict that claimed over six hundred thousand lives and maimed countless others. In the final days, Union newspapers were crying for blood, for the extermination of the South, bordering on genocide as hideous battles raged--battles like the Wilderness campaign. Catton describes a scene were hundreds of wounded Union soldiers were left in the woods only to be burned alive by a fire that swept through the area. Union troops \\"looked on in paralyzed horror as the flames reached these helpless men and ignited the paper cartridges in the boxes at their waists.\\" At Cold Harbor, Lee's troops massacred thousands of Union soldiers in the most lopsided campaign in the war. Catton shows how the war degenerated into trench warfare in the final year--a precursor to how the First World War would be fought. Massed formations of rifle-weilding infantry gave way to snipers, artillery barrages and gatling guns. It was technological advance that made this one of the most horrific wars in modern times. In the end, the South was overwhelmed by sheer numbers, not by heroism, or weapons or tactics. The Union outproduced the Confederates. The South was ground down, her army decimated in battle after battle until there was little left. Catton captures all of this in graphic detail--the battle of the crater, the atrocities of Andersonville, the armies of amputees, the diseases, the starvation, the hatred, the lust for revenge, the smell of death lingering over the countryside. This book has it all. An amazing piece of work that appears very objective.

For a reader who is looking to understand the last crucial year of the war in the East, where war really began to look more like what was to follow in 1914 and less like what Napolean had created, this book will satisfy on all accounts.His genius as a writer is his ability to combine the larger war -- strategy, movement of armies, political objectives -- with the human interest perspectives that make recent battle stories (Sears, et al) come alive through first person accounts of sweat and toil in the line of battle.This ability produces very readible history.

Catton covers the introduction of Grant and how the army changes command structure and the pursuit of Lee is pressed. Battle coverage of the Wilderness Campaign, Spottsylvania, and Petersburg was very interesting. Catton's political coverage of the Lincoln administration helped bolster the book to add further insight.

There's always room for a little bit...this is definitely a Union view of the war. Catton relates the Union generals' strategies, but we never learn of Lee's thoughts and strategies in as great of depth.

In campaign after campaign, battle after battle, Catton demonstrates how carefully laid plans--none too intelligently laid in any event--were botched or allowed to fail from simple failure to move, or to adequately supply, or by a perpetual incoordination of the various branches.Perhaps the best (or worst) example was that of the Crater at Petersburg, where an unparalleled opportunity to rapidly end the war appeared out of Lee's failure to fully respond to Grant's outflanking maneuver to Lee's south. After weeks of careful preparation, the mines in the Confederate trenches were blown--only to see the advantage lost due to officer rivalry, poor timing, and lack of support for the initial shock troops, who were massacred as a consequence.Catton relates a sad, tired tale of endless slaughter caused by the absence of any proven strategy for victory except the mindless sacrificing of ever more thousands of lives to entrenched Confederate guns. The Civil War having begun with fanciful notions of Napoleonic bayonet charges, by Appomattox the trenches of World War I are already looming in the distance.Must Lee have surrendered, or could he have retreated to the hills and given battle yet again? Catton leaves the impression that this was possible, and that in the end the Army of Northern Virginia remained undefeated, like a boxer who, though bloodied and battered, still stands, and that the intimidated Union Army leadership, and perhaps Grant himself, were relieved that Lee finally chose to end the matter and wished to make it as easy as possible for him to do so. Essential to any student of the Civil War: Catton never loses his grip."},{"Title":"A Stillness At Appomattox","review":"It would be an almost impossible task for anyone to figure out just how many books have been written dealing with the American Civil War. It would also be difficult to determine which Civil War historians are most often cited by their peers but there is no doubt that Bruce Catton would be near or more likely at the top of any such list. The reason for this is quite simply that Catton was one of the great historical writers of all time. Very few people can take their readers into the heart of an army, both those of it's soldiers and leaders like Catton and even fewer convey their story in the very clear and easy to read style that this author has mastered. To read this book of pure history is in many ways like reading a historical novel and even the reader who already has a firm grasp on the historical facts of this story will sometimes find themselves wondering what happens next.This is the story of the last campaign of the Army of the Potomac, that Ill-fated army that had so often been humiliated by Robert E. Lee and his Army of Northern Virginia. This campaign was to be different however because there was a new man calling the shots and having a man like U. S. Grant at the helm made all of the difference in the world. It took Grant a while though to convince this often badly led army that he was any different than his predecessors. Different he was however and once he locked horns with Lee he wasn't going to let up until one army or the other was destroyed. In other words Grant understood what had to be done and he was determined to do it.Catton's main field of study was this man Grant but one of the author's most endearing qualities is that he makes no effort to whitewash or hide his subject's faults. Catton also does not attempt to build Grant up by tearing away at Lee like many of the more recent Grant biographers have done. He simply makes Grant's greatness apparent by telling the story the way it happened and it doesn't take long for the reader to figure out what an outstanding general Grant was.The author has done a lot of searching through soldier's letters and memoirs as well as regimental histories and this leads to a very personal perspective of the last year of the war. The stories he has gleaned from these sources are poignant, somber, gleeful and funny. For example, one entire brigade falls out of the final advance upon Lee's army to chase down and cook some chickens that have been scattered by artillery fire. I think it was Napoleon who said something about an army traveling on it's stomach.I highly recommend this book to anyone with an interest in the Civil War. The hard core Civil War reader will find new information here and the casual reader will find that this book is fun to read and no one should have a problem following the story. If Amazon allowed six stars this is one of the few books that would qualify."},{"Title":"A Stillness At Appomattox","review":"The Civil War will never lack for authors, both fiction and historical. Only a handful will leave a reader with an indellible impression. Among these few: Douglas Southall Freeman, Shelby Foote and James M. McPherson. Each has written outstanding works on the war: Freeman; R.E. Lee and Lee's Lieutenants, Foote; Shiloh and his magisterial three volume narrative and McPherson, his brilliant Battle Cry of Freedom.Magnificent works all, but in a class by himself is Bruce Catton.I recall my father raving about Catton; \\"When you read him, it's like you're there,\\" he said. Unfortunately, I wasn't so quick to take his advice. Then, in 2000, I saw David McCullough on C-Span 2 and he raved about \\"A Stillness at Appomattox.\\" Then, I decided to give it a try.Lucky for me. I've read many accounts regarding the last agonizing year of the war, but none has matched Catton for sheer storytelling power. One marches with the Army of the Potomac as it seeks out Robert E. Lee and the Army of Northern Virginia. You witness and somehow, almost take part as these, the war's two military giants, Grant and Lee collide. You see the mistakes and agonize with the men yet, you always stand in awe of the everyday valor these heroes of the Blue and the Gray make. But despite battlefield blunders and poor leadership, draftees who are more likely to desert than face the enemy, the men of the Army of the Potomac never lose their faith in themselves and it is this spirit that drives the Army to ultimate victory.Words fail me to describe how awesome this book is. I thought it would have aged badly, but it hasn't. It's truly a timeless work. This book, along with Mr. Lincoln's Army and Glory Road constitute the greatest tribute to the men of the Army of the Potomac and in a way, the Army of Northern Virginia as well.Enjoy."},{"Title":"A Stillness At Appomattox","review":"Bruce Catton's \\"A Stillness at Appomatox\\" was the first adult Civil War book I attempted after, many years ago, I was captivated by a series of Civil War stories geared to pre-teens. Since that time, I have continued to read about the Civil War and recently have recaptured something of my boyish fascination with the subject -- I hope at a more thoughtful level. I was reluctant to struggle with this particular book again because of the memory of my struggle with the book as a child. But I needed at last to go back to it to round out my reading of other works by Catton.Catton's book tells the story of the Civil War in the East beginning in the winter of 1863 following the Battle of Gettysburg. The first thing to notice about the book is the clear, lyrical quality of the prose which somehow frustrated me as a child. Catton writes in a propulsive forward-moving style. He tends to like long sentences joined with series of \\"ands\\". This makes his account move quickly although sometimes a bit stringily. Also Catton has a gift for lyrical metaphors to drive home his points -- whether in describing the fields or in describing the emotions of the men. His writing at its best has a poetical, moving quality. Most importantly, Catton writes lucidly. His descriptions of the battles and of troop movements are relatively easy to follow. Many of the accounts I have read since I first tried this book are detailed and ponderous. This is never the case with Catton. He gives a good, basic picture of the battles he describes which will stand the reader looking for more detailed accounts in good stead.Besides the quality of the writing, A Stillness at Appomattox is notable for the story it has to tell. Broadly speaking, Catton focuses on how the Civil War changed after its first two years, and he explains why. Although the carnage of the first two years of the war was immense, the scope of the war increased markedly following Gettysburg. The Civil War became the first total war, bringing trench warfare, sustained fighting, destruction of property, and hardship to noncombatants in its wake. Many later writers have also made this point, but Catton unforgettably drives it home.Catton thus describes the final Union campaign in the East (There is little in the book on the Western theatre of the War.) of the Army of the Potomac from the Wilderness through Spottsylvania, Cold Harbor, Petersburg, and Appomatox. He describes the desparate, harsh nature of these engagements under the leadership of U.S. Grant. Catton also pays a great deal of attention to Philip Sheridan, to the destruction he wrought in the Shenendoah Valley Campaign, and to his key roles in the Battle of Five Forks (Petersburg) and the final race to the Appomatox Court House. Catton's discussion of Sheridan brought home to me the cruel all-out nature of the final stages of the War.Catton also integrates well the military aspects of the Civil War with the political aspects. There are good pictures of Lincoln and of the war-weariness of the North which threatened the military efforts of the Armies until the last phases of the conflict. Catton's work emphasizes, in line with recent scholarship, the critical role of African-American soldiers in the Union's war effort. But he also tends to support a reconciliationist approach following the end of the conflict rather than what might have been a more committed attempt to protect the rights of the Freedmen. Although Catton writes from the Union side of the line, he clearly is impressed with the military and personal character of Robert E. Lee and with the valor shown by the Army of Northern Virginia under the most trying of circumstances.I was enthralled by the pace of the book, by Catton's writing, and by his love for and knowledge of his subject. This is a book to come to as an adult. It will encourage the thoughtful reader to reflect upon the Civil War as the watershed event in our Nation's history."},{"Title":"A Stillness At Appomattox","review":"Unfortunately, much of Bruce Catton's works are out of print but, most titles are readily available in out of print bookshops. I read this title, which is currently in print, along with the first two, out of print, titles in the great Army of the Potomac trilogy. A Stillness at Appomattox is a great book in it's own right but, it is a particular treat to read the entire three volume set. Not only is the history interesting but, it is so well written that the enjoyment of reading it is incrteased many fold. I particularly thought that Catton's description of Gen. Phil Sheridan's campaign in the Shenedoah Valley was particularly vivid and fascinating. As is Catton's wont, the book ends rather abruptly, leading to the end of the military aspects of the war but not really describing the actual surrender ceremonies at Appomattox Courthouse. He also used this technique in an earlier (out of print) volume as he led the reader to the Gettysburgh Address but then stopped abruptly as Lincoln got up to speak, not describing the address or the reaction to it. Catton does this so well that it really works. He is truly one of my favorite authors. I am now reading my out of print copies of Catton's second great trilogy, The Centennial History of the Civil War.I recommend his out of print as well as his currently available Civil War histories highly."},{"Title":"A Stillness At Appomattox","review":"Bruce Catton is, in my opinion, the most readable author of American Civil War history. Whenever I've labored through some book I wanted to read but have struggled with, I reward myself with something he has written. This trilogy is, as all his work is, thoroughly researched and very balanced. It would be hard to detect any bias in this native Michiganer of the first half of the 20th century, though I vaguely suspect he had more sympathy for the South, if only for the \\"pluck\\" (he likes that word in fact) of their \\"David vs. Goliath\\" undertaking. This 3rd volume is the Pulitzer Prize winner, and with good reason. Essentially, Catton deals here with the classic struggle of Grant vs. Lee, but he does so in such a way that illuminates Grant in a light that is not only pleasing, but obviously genuine. This fine Army of the Potomac, so thoroughly identified with McClellan, was in fact a sharp instrument waiting for a leader like Grant to come along and put it to good use. Grant implicitly understood the assignment and the way to carry it out in the shortest time possible, which argues for his humanity, not his cruelty as other authors have intimated. Proof of his character is clear in the Instrument of Surrender, which was as far-sighted as any such document could have been (Sherman's, just a bit later, may have been a bit too generous for the politicians; it had to be revised in order to be accepted by Washington and to prevent the renewal of hostilities with Johnston). In any case, the real beauty of any of Catton's works is his insight not so much into the Grants and Lees, but into the common soldier of both sides; what made them fight so savagely one moment, but embrace one another so fully the next? The answer lay in the strange brotherhood that developed between the men of the Army of Northern Virginia and those of the Army of the Potomac. These men, after many years of hardship and privation and death, were a bit more likely to see their generals as the cause of their suffering and a lot more likely to see the tens and hundreds of thousands on both sides who stayed home while they fought as the real enemy. In this common bond, Catton intimates, lay the seed which made reunification at least palatable in the minds of so many men from so many distant places."},{"Title":"A Stillness At Appomattox","review":"At age 22, in 1974, I was a regular, if not voracious, reader of history. As a senior at Michigan State University, I took a class in the Civil War. The professor and the course were nondescript (\\"diagram Sickles' forward position at Gettysburg...\\"). But assigned to us was \\"A Stillness At Appomattox,\\" and it opened a whole new world to me, both in understanding how history is the story of those much like ourselves, and in the beauty of its prose. Ten years later, I made a pilgrimage to Benzonia, Michigan, to Bruce Catton country, to walk upon the ground that inspired him. Nearly 30 years later, I remain in awe at his storytelling. I have remained an American history - and Civil War - buff since reading \\"A Stillness At Appomattox.\\" The book changed, and enriched, my life in ways I cannot count, and surely made me a better writer than I would have otherwise been(and I have written considerably for publication). Other books have had a profound impact on my life; this one changed it. Read it, and let it change yours."},{"Title":"A Stillness At Appomattox","review":"There is no substitute for Bruce Catton when it comes to the Civil War. No one has captured the heartbreak, suffering, the smell of gunpowder, or the feel for the soldiers of that era in the way Catton has. Growing up in Michigan, he knew these men in their old age and listened, as a boy, to their stories of the War of the Rebellion, undoubtedly enthralled and deeply impressed. This volume, the third in his trilogy of the Army of the Potomac begins with the 1864 campaign after Grant, now the commander of all the Union armies, moves east to accompany, but not command (that was still General Meade, the victor of Gettysburg), the Army of the Potomac in its bloodiest campaigns against its antagonist, Lee and his indomitable Army of Northern Virginia. Catton tells a captivating tale, very competently covering strategy and tactics, and the reasons soldiers fight. His strength, however, is his feel for the soldiers themselves, be they enlisted or officer, private, 1st Sergeant, or commander. His anecdotal approach to history is unsurpassed, except for perhaps John Elting, and through his eyes and pen, the reader gets to know these men on a personal level. What Catton conveys to the reader at his level best, though, is the heartbreak of the losses incurred year after year. Famous units, such as the Irish Brigade, the Iron Brigade, the 5th New Hampshire, the indomitable, crack Regular Division of the V Corps, the 1st Minnesota, that 'shattered thunderbolt', all fight as titans, and wither away because of heavy losses, to remain as shadows in the army, but never rebuilt or reconstituted. So many brave young men gone, horrific losses that won't be suffered again until the meat grinding senselessness of the Great War. Colorful, talented personalities abound, from Mississippi cavalryman Grimes Davis, killed at Brandy Station, mercurial, brilliant Phil Kearny who could 'make men follw [him] to hell', lawyer turned soldier Francis Barlow, who had the cold dead eyes of a killer, and cured straggling in his division in a most enlightened manner, to 'Greasy Dick' Richardson, killed at Bloody Lane at the Battle of Antietam shouting for the green flags of his favorite Irish Brigade, artilleryman John Gibbon who gave the Iron Brigade white gaiters, the regulation hats of the Regulars, and an outstanding combat reputation, finally to such personalities an Emory Upton, the northern Stonewall Jackson, who won his general's stars on the battlefield from Grant himself. This book, and the entire trilogy itself, are a must for the military historian, Civil War buff or not. Catton's work has stood the test of time, and he is still the best Civil War historian this country has produced."},{"Title":"A Stillness At Appomattox","review":"Bruce Catton is largely responsible for the continuing Civil War publishing boom, with his publication in the early 1950's of his trilogy history of the Army of the Potomac. Catton's passion for the subject, combined with his journalistic talents, captured the essence of a fundamental of American mythology. As a boy in Wisconsin he idolized the veterans he came to know in his community and he became committed if not obsessed to learning about them and documenting what he learned. What he learned is one of the great stories in our country's history - the story of the common soldier in the American Civil War. It is not an attempt at applying the academic method, it is journalism - and first rate journalism., and great story telling. Yet, it is still historically relevant and significant. Catton was able to put the various complex subplots in the perspective of the maturation of the democratic nation and its institutions (for example, Indiana Governor O. P. Morton's wartime state dictatorship and the implications for states' rights in relationship to the national government). The famous figures are included, and humanized, but it is really the story of the rank and file. The common soldier, who suffered unmercifully under incompetent leadership, wasteful bureaucracies, political maneuvering, a multitude of physical hardships, bad food and medicine and every other handicap imaginable (including death and dismemberment in what was then a new and highly efficient killing field of warfare) - and yet somehow emerged victorious. It is not a romantic story, but it is a story full of praise for those who served their nation in one of its great defining moments. There isn't any sympathy for the opposing Confederates - neither is their any condemnation or hatred (because the soldiers themselves did not condemn or hate). For the hard core ACW armchair campaigner there is still much to be gleaned from a read or re-read of Catton's trilogy. For the casual reader, this work is a great starting place to understand the ACW - the conflict that, in Catton's view, framed and defined the unique history of the United States. There are a few misconceptions scattered about - but no matter, this is the stuff of legends. There are conclusions drawn that are not thoroughly supported - again, no matter. Catton told a great story greatly, and it has stood the test of time as a benchmark accomplishment."},{"Title":"A Stillness At Appomattox","review":"I have read many books about the Civil War. I first read A Stillness at Appomattox when I was a student some 20 years ago. What a revelation to read it again these years later. The action comes to so much life on these pages that there were many times that I felt like I was there and many times when I wish I had been there.Absolutely spellbinding. I sat down to read the introduction and ended up reading the entire book in one long sitting. I could not put it down.If all historical books were written this well with so much detail included in the flowing words, I would probably only read history books.My many thanks to David McCullough whose wonderful works inspired me to re-explore this classic piece."},{"Title":"A Stillness At Appomattox","review":"The third book in Bruce Catton's history of the Army of the Potomac takes the narrative from the time Grant assumed command until the end of the war. This was the bloodiest period of the army's history, with more than half of all of its casualties occurring with the last year of the fighting. Catton recounts all of the great battles that helped end the war, from The Wilderness through the tragedy of Cold Harbor to the siege of Petersburg and finally to Appomattox Court House. Along the way, he documents the military genius of Ulysses S. Grant, with whom the Army of the Potomac finally had a commander with the ability and the perserverance to win the war.

I have always been interested in the Civil War Era, but have not really read anything about the civil war probably since High School. I have to say that this was an excellent book that has reignited my interest. This book covers the last year or so, and only the history of the Army of the Potamac, and does so in a way that makes you feel like you are there with the soldiers, cussing the officers along with them.Some of the parts of the book are hilarious, like the description of the battle of Spotsylvania Court House, I was rolling in tears. Some are incredibly frustrating, like Cold Harbor. Some are just plain sad, like the description of the \\"crater\\" assault at Petersburg.All in all, I am happy I bought and read this book, it was excellent, and it was one of those books that I wish would have gone on another 300 pages."},{"Title":"A Stillness At Appomattox","review":"I can't think of many books of any genre that I would like to revisit after an initial read. I not only want to reread Catton's Army of the Potomac Trilogy, I want to start on it again right away. His prose is compelling. His ability to flesh out history with asides is stunning. He is long gone but these works are a testament to his gift as an author and researcher. His three volume work on the Civil War is also enjoyable and the Unabridged audio versions with Nelson Runger are a pleasure."},{"Title":"A Stillness At Appomattox","review":"Part 3 of Bruce Catton's fantastic trilogy of the civil war is an interesting look at how the Army of the Potomac ended the war.

An essential collection to any civil war historical library."},{"Title":"A Stillness At Appomattox","review":"The other customer reviews have made all the points about this excellent book that I would like to make. So I'll just add my little bit by quoting a sample of Catton's prose, to show how he puts the reader right in the middle of the action.This passage concerns the Union charge at Cold Harbor.&quot;Two hundred yards from the starting point Gibbon's division hit a deep swamp whose existence nobody had known about, and the swamp split the line in two....The swamp grew wider as the men advanced and the separated halves could not rejoin, and in the swamp there were many snipers who took a heavy toll, and in the end two separated brigades went staggering up to the invulnerable trenches....there is memory of a colonel standing on a parapet, swinging his sword and shouting to his men to come on. But the colonel went down, his lifeless body draped across the parapet, and he was hit thereafter by so many stray bullets that when a truce was declared a few days later he could be identified only by the buttons on his sleeve.&quot;"},{"Title":"A Stillness At Appomattox","review":"Quite simply, this is the best retelling ever written on the U.S. Civil War. No other author has been able to mesh the savagery of battle with the tedium of forced marches on wet, muddy roads. While chronicling only the final year of the war, Catton brilliantly explores the Confederacy in its futile attempt at a last stand in Virginia. He vividly describes the march of the Northern juggernaut as it rolls towards a bloody victory, while never losing sight of the personal, individual struggles taking place, blending it all together and even finding room for a lighthearted moment or two, such as when a group of Union soldiers were startled one night by a Rebel soldier, probably in his 50's, who walked through a swamp, cursing all the way, sat down at their fire and proceeded to rant about the ignorance of the Confederacy while his false teeth kept falling out, all to the uproarious laughter of his new found captors. This is masterful writing, and deservedly won the Pulitzer Prize for non-fiction. A very special book, and an American literary treasure."},{"Title":"A Stillness At Appomattox","review":"Bruce Catton grew up in Benzonia, MI in the early 1900s. There were still Civil War Vets living at that time and a few lived in that same town. It was listening to their stories as a child that inspired Catton to write the Army of the Potomac Trilogy, of which A Stillness at Appomattox is the third and final installment.Stillness, along with the other two books, Glory Road and the other's name escapes me, paints a picture of the Civil War few have been able to duplicate. He tells the story of the Civil War from the perspective of the common foot soldier.Drawing heavily from personal correspondence and regimental histories, Catton puts us smack in the middle of the Wilderness, at the breastworks of Spotsylvania Courthouse and in the trenches around Petersburg as well at the surrender of Lee to Grant.If you're a Civil War buff, and you haven't read Catton, you're not a Civil War buff."},{"Title":"A Stillness At Appomattox","review":"This book is a highly readable history of the final campaignof the Union Army of the Potomac.

A must read for anyone interested in the period"},{"Title":"A Stillness At Appomattox","review":"Bruce Catton winds up his trilogy on the Army of the Potomac with this detailed, immersive, often grueling account of how the Union finally broke Robert E. Lee and ended the American Civil War.It was a needfully brutal affair. After taking command of Northern forces, Ulysses S. Grant embarked on a yearlong campaign to break the stalemate of move and countermove around Washington, D. C. To win, Grant settled on a ruthlessness that, Catton states, brought the tools of total war to his side, and with them, total victory.\\"Over and over the war had been prolonged because of the timid, restrictive caution that could paralyze action - the habit of mind that was always too busy weighing risks to grasp opportunities,\\" Catton writes.It's easy to look back and say this, and it certainly makes sense. Yet reading Catton made me less convinced of Grant's impressiveness than I have been. His style of attack was the sort that worked only when you had a army much larger than your foe, and a worn-out opponent too punchy to counter the clumsy haymaker blows Catton recounts here. Catton seems to blame the miscues on Grant's lieutenants. Oddly for a guy who wrote another trilogy on Grant alone, Catton keeps Grant largely off-stage.This would be more of a problem if not for the continuation of the Army Of The Potomac trilogy's great strength, which is its focus on the common Union soldier. Those of us who have read through the earlier volumes \\"Mr. Lincoln's Army\\" and \\"Glory Road\\" know how much Catton bores in on the plight of the typical foot soldier, and this carries through to \\"A Stillness At Appomattox\\" with its accounts of the intricacies of trench warfare and the fiery death that awaited the immobile wounded in the burning Wilderness.Catton's ability to verbalize deep thoughts and connect them to the struggle of these men comes to the fore here more than it did in the earlier volumes, a key reason perhaps why it won the Pulitzer a year after its 1953 publication.\\"Everything had changed, the war and the men and the land they fought for, but the road ahead had not changed,\\" he writes. \\"It went on through the trees and past the little towns and over the hills, and there was no getting to the end of it. The goal was a going-toward rather than an arriving.\\"The characters here are as vivid and lively as ever, including some carryovers from the earlier volumes like crusty George Meade and the stolid-but-hapless Ambrose Burnside. Most powerfully presented is Phil Sheridan, a short cavalry commander who enspirits the troops with his embodiment of Grant's always-attack philosophy. I think Catton oversells Sheridan a tad, though, and I did find his battle accounts harder to follow than before. This may be because the war by 1864-65 had become a static trench-based campaign of battles that blended into one another, same circumstances but different names, but sometimes Catton gets pulled into the monotony of the experience to a nearly-deadening degree.Still, the highlights here are real standouts, such as the utterly bizarre but nearly brilliant Union gambit known as the Battle of the Crater and a Confederate attack that put Abraham Lincoln on the front lines. Catton's fine writing and total commitment to his subject make for a satisfying and memorable conclusion to one of the great running histories you are likely to read."},{"Title":"A Stillness At Appomattox","review":"\\"A Stillness at Appomattox\\" is the third volume in Bruce Catton's superb trilogy on the Union Army of the Potomac. It covers the last, awful year of the Civil War in the Eastern Theater, and the bloody path of combat leading from the Wilderness to Cold Harbor, to Petersburg, and finally to Appomattox Court House.At the center of Catton's narrative is U.S. Grant, newly promoted to Lieutenant General and brought east to take command of all the Union Armies. Grant elects to leave General George Meade in command of the Army of the Potomac, but his decision to locate his headquaters in the field with that army means Grant will really be in charge. It will be Grant who will direct the ruthless pursuit of General Robert E. Lee's Confederate Army of Northern Virginia.Catton deftly describes the changes brought by the war, in the content of the Army of the Potomac, in the political leadership in Washington, and in the country writ large. Four years of civil war had changed the United States, and the long-suffering Army of the Potomac was somehow an exemplar of those changes. Catton's narrative includes many carefully chosen vignettes which capture the flavor of the times.\\"A Stillness at Appomattox\\" is very highly recommended to students of the Civil War as a still astonishingly good example of the best in narrative history."},{"Title":"A Stillness At Appomattox","review":"Bruce Catton's writing is superb and his attention to detail is vivid and at times hard to fathom.

Frederica Sagor Maas's memoirs about being a female screenwriter are both enlightening and bittersweet and, at the end of the day, serve to emphasize the reality that the more things change, the more they remain the same. Duplicity, back-stabbing and ego-driven myopia prevail as much today as they did when Frederica and her husband first sought to carve their niche in Tinseltown. A powerful retrospective of stardom and the price that is so often ultimately paid for fleeting glory."},{"Title":"The Shocking Miss Pilgrim: A Writer in Early Hollywood","review":"This book would make a great read for people interested in any of the following topics: early Hollywood, the screenwriting profession, working-women's history, and, to a lesser extent, the history of the progressive movement. Though written in a light, fast style, Sagor Maas' book is filled with specific information. She memorably describes details of early-twentieth-century New York and 1920's Los Angeles, which will fascinate those who live in those cities now. Sagor Maas was accorded a surprising amount of respect as a business woman, becoming head story editor of Universal Pictures' New York office, and for a time earning top-dollar figures as a Hollywood screenwriter. Her memories of life as a professional editor and writer are clear and entertaining, and I suspect much of it is still true today: studio heads still pass scripts around among different writers, assign screen credits based on factors that may have nothing to do with writing, go on personal power trips that can wreak havoc with their employees, and rework ideas with no thought for their originators. One important difference now is that writers have more legal ability to complain when their work is plagiarized or misused.It's true that Sagor Maas pulls no punches when describing the bosses and colleagues she disliked, but she also owns up to some of her own faults. She admits that her personality could be difficult, describes incidents where she may have acted dishonorably, details some of her foolish money decisions, and wonders if she was too promiscuous in her early life. She doesn't seem to realize that there may be a connection between plagiarizing a writer and hiring a seamstress to knock off designer clothes, but she does tell the story of how she was given the full screen credit for the 1925 film \\"Dance Madness,\\" although she had only made some slight improvements to Alice D. G. Miller's script. She later found herself on the other end, when credit for her work was given to others. Sagor Maas points out that the Hollywood Writer's Guild was new and weak then, and writers had no choice but to go along with the system--this reality should interest today's writers.The book has a few flaws: although I found most of Sagor Maas' anecdotes about celebrities jibed with other accounts I've read, there are a few that are likely not true. The book's editor missed a few typos, a few of the captions in the photo section (apparently not written by the author) are inaccurate, and the 1920's-style font, while period-correct, is hard to read. It should have been used only for the title and chapter headings. I'm taking one star off for these issues, but they didn't do much to impede my enjoyment of the book.As some other reviewers have pointed out, Sagor Maas' writing style is not the most literary, but in my opinion, at the time she wrote the book, she still knew how to tell a focused story and engage a reader. I was especially interested to find that this book doesn't tell of someone who achieved success after success, but of someone who had major ups and downs. In one section of the book Sagor Maas is attending glamorous parties with silent-screen stars, and in another she's \\"occupying a tacky studio apartment,\\" down the hall from a faded and broke Mae Murray. But Sagor Maas never despaired. In a perhaps too-brief chapter, she tells how she became a regional air warden in World War II, helping organize neighborhood rescue in the case of an air attack, but also doing mundane household tasks related to the war effort. She moved into local politics, helping mobilize voters for the reelection of FDR in 1944, and raising funds for a neighborhood conservation project. As she grew older, she continued to research and develop projects that interested her, in spite of their sometimes having little commercial value. Sagor Maas knew she and her writer husband didn't have the best business sense, but they valiantly pursued ideas they felt had artistic meaning. Few people who don't end up on top get to tell their stories in print later, but I was so glad Sagor Maas did."},{"Title":"The Shocking Miss Pilgrim: A Writer in Early Hollywood","review":"Frederica Sagor Maas died this year at the age of 111. She was probably the last writer from the earliest days of the golden silent film era. At the age of 99 she wrote her memoir of her years in Hollywood, The Shocking Miss Pilgrim: A Writer in Early Hollywood. It is a tell-all story where Sagor Maas pulls no punches and gives her story about how she was royally screwed over by the Hollywood cheating machine. Gossip galore told in an oral style, Miss Pilgrim starts with Sagor Maas's family history and her introduction to Hollywood via an education in journalism.Miss Pilgrim is set in a font reminiscent of that used in title cards from silent films, which makes reading the story seem like attending a film Sagor Maas in fact wrote. I found the periods and commas almost identical in appearance and thus hard to differentiate; I often mistook a sentence to be over when it had only elongated itself by a camouflaged comma.Sagor Maas was not a well-known name in Hollywood, but she paid her dues as a screenwriter for almost thirty years, working on dozens of silent films, many of which are now unfortunately part of the vast cache of lost films. She writes about the writing process from the earliest steps of tossing around ideas, to creating \\"treatments\\" to the endless cycle of rewrites. It is in this final stage where a writer can lose complete credit for the work she has done, as common studio policy, and contract practice, at the time assigned full writing credit to the screenwriter who handled the last rewrite--regardless who had written the work in the first place. Sagor Maas lost her credit on many a film when the studio sent its final draft to another writer to rewrite again.Miss Pilgrim was a rapid read, and I felt as though Sagor Maas was sitting comfortably across from me telling stories from eighty years ago. She has nothing to fear and no one left to apologize to so what she writes reflects exactly how she feels. Hollywood was and remains a dog-eat-dog world where today's stars are tomorrow's nobodies, and Sagor Maas tells us so:\\"Then one fine day, the Trocadero [a new restaurant] happened and changed all that. I tell this story because it reveals like nothing else the tinsel of the Hollywood scene, its basic insincerity, its hypocrisy, its cruelty, its shabby neglect of the worthy and deserving--the desertion at the drop of a hat of the old for anything new and in the groove. Wherever the Hollywood picture people went, that is where you, if you were in the motion picture business, wanted to be seen and written about.\\"Sagor Maas gives her unbiased opinion of show business people, ripping into producers, fellow writers who stole her work, and even celebrities who were prone to make fools of themselves at parties. She attended a wild party where alcohol flowed like Niagara:\\"The last thing I remember was seeing Clara [Bow] atop a table, shimmying her clothes off and dancing in the nude to the hoots of her appreciative and inebriated audience. I must have passed out because the next thing I knew I was home in my own bed with a horrible hangover.\\"When Sagor Maas recalled meeting Lucille LeSueur, who had not yet changed her name to Joan Crawford, at the train station upon her arrival in Hollywood, she wrote:\\"When the train pulled in, I couldn't believe what I saw. My first thought was that the name 'LeSueur' (pronounced 'sewer') was certainly applicable. She was a gum-chewing dame, heavily made up, skirts up to her belly button, wildly frizzed hair. An obvious strumpet.\\"Fellow writers had no feeling of solidarity. If a colleague was assigned a final rewrite, and thus took full writing credit for the entire work, even it was the original brainchild of someone else, no one felt any guilt over the theft of intellectual property. Sagor Maas has this to say about the men and women in her field:\\"Writers...writers...beware! We are a breed of brain pickers--even the best of us--not to be trusted.\\"With caustic opinions like this, no wonder Miss Pilgrim was such a rapid read. Sagor Maas kept them coming, even ripping into her producer bosses:\\"I had been assigned to a producer named Lloyd Sheldon, a former newspaperman but with none of the pleasant outgoing qualities usually found in gentlemen of the press. Mr. Sheldon was a first-class prig, serving in the 'lowly' picture business that he heartily disdained--yet at a handsome salary. Surreptitiously, he was involved with a voluptuous young woman reader in the story department fifteen years his junior. Vera (I do not recall her last name) had an aristocratic Russian background. She too had condescended to be employed in the 'lowly' picture business and was quite a snob.\\"Miss Pilgrim had several spelling errors, including the atrocious \\"fourtyish\\", and she refers to Thomas Mann's son as \\"Gola\\" instead of \\"Golo\\". It doesn't take long to see that Sagor Maas uses her memoir as a forum to rip into everyone who ever did her wrong, but it would be a mistake to see it only in the hindsight of venom. I wish Sagor Maas had spent more time describing how the horrors of McCarthyism ruined her and her husband's careers, as well as the careers of their friends. The Maases did subscribe to The Daily People's World and Soviet Life, but neither Frederica nor her husband was a card-carrying Communist. The Shocking Miss Pilgrim: A Writer in Early Hollywood is foremost a valuable resource giving insight into the early workings of Hollywood. What might be at first an unknown name of a producer or a writer of a long-forgotten silent film, Sagor Maas develops into a full portrait of a pioneer in film production. She recognizes those that paved the way and makes it well known that one of those pioneers was in fact herself."},{"Title":"The Shocking Miss Pilgrim: A Writer in Early Hollywood","review":"I became aware of this author when I read her obituary recently.

Here's one of my favorites: &quot;I was fit to be tied, ready to throw in the sponge and tell them where they could take their cotton-pickin' job.&quot; If this is your idea of sparkling prose, welcome to it. I find it no wonder that she and her husband didn't get too far as screenwriters. Of course, the fact that their greatest success was a now-forgotten Betty Grable musical should tell you something. As for the &quot;shocking&quot; facts about early Hollywood, the trade reviews (see above) quote every one of the most interesting, gossipy and shocking passages in the book. So save your money: you've just read it."},{"Title":"The Shocking Miss Pilgrim: A Writer in Early Hollywood","review":"It's hard to believe the world described by Frederica Sagor Maas in her memoir &quot;The Shocking Miss Pilgrim&quot; existed within the lifetimes of people alive today. So many of those who were once household names are now forgotten, so many of the places changed irrevocably.Yet many of Ms. Maas' experiences &amp; views will come as quite a surprise to the younger generation who tend to think they invented sex, drugs &amp; partying. It's a revelation to hear a woman born in 1900, talking about herself at 20 state &quot;I considered sex something natural like eating or getting dressed. Once it was over, it was over.&quot;For a lifelong LA resident (now in exile) like myself, the greatest pleasure of this book was reading about what life was like in the entertainment capital at the beginning of it's reign. Now decrepit apartment houses described when they were desirable addresses; crowded urban corridors that were once sylvan wildlife areas! What surprises lurk here for those who know LA well!For the general reader, the memoir moves along well, with Ms. Maas' tart comments always enlivening the recollections. The writing style is sparse &amp; not especially descriptive as you would expect from someone who got her start writing scenarios for silent film. I did feel the book could benefit from some fleshing out; entire decades pass in a few paragraphs, the section describing the making of the film the book is entitled after is only a few pages long, &amp; there were many experiences mentioned that would have benefitted from more description. But I guess at nearly 100 the past must often seem a film at fast forward &amp; Ms. Maas' memory is to be commended!This book is a valuable addition to the memoirs from the Golden Age of Film. It is especially valuable because it's from someone who was not viewing the industry from the heights but rather from the trenches. I salute Frederica Sagor Maas for having the honesty &amp; clear-sightedness to produce this autobiography &amp; for living the life she has led."},{"Title":"The Shocking Miss Pilgrim: A Writer in Early Hollywood","review":"\\"The Shocking Miss Pilgrim\\" is an entertaining and informative read for film buffs,history fans, and many others. After I heard Hersey Felder sing \\"Back Bay Polka\\" inthe musical review \\"Gershwin Alone\\", I traced the song to the Betty Grable moviewith the same title as this book. At the time of the movie's release, GeorgeGershwin had been dead almost two decades. Supposedly, the songs were previously unpublished Gershwin material. Maas claims some were writtenby studio composers.There are many episodes of early Hollywood, featuring nice people and some of thereally rottens. Many ring true, and some smell false. Maas outlived most of thepeople she describes as evil or weak, so they can not complain or sue.It is not literature, and it is not history, but it provides some interestingscenes that might be of interest to historians, or to gossips. Some reviewershave labeled the author \\"left-wing\\". There are a few scattered political commentsand a few concentrated pages, but conservatives need not fear an attack on theirbeliefs. Maas is after specific Hollywood powers.The dust jacket cover photo is striking. Serious photographers might want tolearn about the other work of the photographer."},{"Title":"The Shocking Miss Pilgrim: A Writer in Early Hollywood","review":"Extraordinary story from many angles: that of a bright, young female writer in the Twenties who could have risen to the top of her profession and should have, were it not for the jealous men who got in her way. That of a woman who was there when Hollywood was still a dirt road and saw it all. That of an emancipated woman who celebrates her independence in every sense of the word. That of a brilliant screenwriting couple permanently scarred by the McCarthy Witchhunts. I would have wished for more on her (and Ernest's) life after Hollywood. Did they stay in touch with Hollywood friends? How did their lives change? Reminds me a bit of today's crop of downsized millions forced to rechart their lives and who face the formidable barrier of age discrimination. Wonderful book! And by a near-centenarian, yet! What a salute to life after 50!!"},{"Title":"The Shocking Miss Pilgrim: A Writer in Early Hollywood","review":"An interesting view firsthand of women writers of that day. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Shocking Miss Pilgrim: A Writer in Early Hollywood","review":"I came across this book a few years ago when I learned that the author -- a next door neighbor of my great, great-grandparents 1908-11 -- was still living at 102! (They are featured on pg. 6) I phoned her and had a wonderful conversation.She had written this book three years earlier. She has some wonderful experiences, and reports them with untethered opinion and vigor. But her style -- weighed down by cliches -- fast becomes wearisome. Maybe we should give her a break --- she was 99 when she wrote this.There is lots of interest here -- turn of the century Russian, secular Jewish life in Manhattan, early Hollywood, left-wing politics (McCarthy wasn't being paranoid about all the communists within the gates)."},{"Title":"The Shocking Miss Pilgrim: A Writer in Early Hollywood","review":"Years ago I read a book by Paul Zollo which was a collection of interviews with (at the time) living and still cognizant pioneers of the film industry. A screenwriter, Sagor Maas was the first interviewee and the oldest one as well. The entire collection of interviews was interesting and revealing and Sagor Maas' interview was among the best in my opinion. That's how I came to read this book the first time.Sagor Maas came up in conversation a couple of weeks ago and I figured her death might have gone unnoticed. Reasoning that very few people make it to 110+ I did the perfunctory check online and could not confirm or deny her passing. The other day I saw her obituary and decided to reread her book. At 111, she had survived her earliest contemporaries and was probably one of the last links from the silent era excluding some juveniles that may still be with us.On my first reading of this book, I liked it quite a bit. I still like it. While the writing wasn't /isn't all that great, she was extremely old when she wrote it. With that in mind, this is a good book that serves as a portal to the past that starts before movies talked.Sagor Maas was unique in many ways. The daughter of Russian Jewish immigrants, she had unique opportunities for a young woman of her time. She had a university education, was intelligent and imaginative, and she had the chutzpah that even a man could appreciate and begrudgingly admire. While women had not broken through the glass ceiling in the film industry, in many ways they banded together both literally and figuratively to make their presence known. Sagor Maas enjoyed the upward mobility that her position afforded her, but she was hindered by many things. She was unflinchingly blunt and advocated unpopular causes.This book was enjoyable because it was crammed with anecdotes depicting life on the MGM lot and beyond. While not a star herself though she possessed the looks to have been one, she had access to well-known celebrities such as John Gilbert, Norma Shearer, and Greta Garbo. She viewed the talent as somewhat bereft of intellectual gifts, but still I found myself swooning a bit as she talked about the old days, her perceptions, and spiced things up with anecdotes a-plenty.By the time she and her husband Ernest Maas sold their screenplay of what became The Shocking Miss Pilgrim, the face and landscape in Hollywood was rapidly changing. The Maas' felt their concept/story was savaged (an understatement). Their socialist leanings put the final nail in the coffin as they were broke as well as finished in the film industry which was increaingly ruthless. They contemplated suicide but reconsidered it because they realized quite accurately that they had one another and left the film industry. Their story alone is worthy of a screen treatment.I'm in no position to evaluate their work as writers/scenarists, but given the post WWII sentiment which preceded full-blown McCarthyism it is safe to assume that Sagor Maas was not exaggerating on that aspect of her life.Given this book's limited availability, if you can score a copy it is an interesting read."},{"Title":"The Shocking Miss Pilgrim: A Writer in Early Hollywood","review":"Fredricka Sagor was the daughter of immigrants, the youngest sibling and the most independent. She chose a writing career rather than a respectable lawyer or doctors life. She lucked into writing for a film studio when she had to cover for her alcoholic boss there. Before long she was running the show, and she had a very fine wardrobe to show for it. After a string of lovers and related film industry jobs, Sagor met Ernest Maas and promptly married him.This story is fascinating not only for its glimpse into the not-often profiled writing industry of early Hollywood but for its solid writing style and critiques of an era that is often glamorized. Maas is not afraid to name names, but she does not attempt to scandalize them. She often expresses pity, even for those who stole her hard work.The most poinent part of this book is the ending when Maas describes losing her husband.In spite of the fact that the narrative wanders at times, this is a worthy read for a broad audience."},{"Title":"The Shocking Miss Pilgrim: A Writer in Early Hollywood","review":"I enjoyed having a woman's perspective on the early Hollywood Era but found the writing style a bit dry.

She flays many well-known celebrities to the bone. Even the individuals she likes, she finds fault.Some utopia she leaves in her wake.

Enormous, steaming sentences, reeking with exotic images and jaguar tracks contain a sorrowful epic of the surreal politics of hot, underdeveloped places that know more corruption than justice. Weaving in and out, from one person's thoughts to another's, from one time to a second, with almost no dialogue, no conversation, no quotation marks, but moving from the mind of a general to dictator to \\"the people\\" to the female love interest and back again, Garcia Marquez spins a horrific story that is unlikely to be similar to anything you have read before. Maybe you will be satisfied to read this as a \`one-off' kind of book that demands your total attention, all your powers of imagination and your determination. It is not a simple novel. I realized that Milorad Pavic, the Serbian author of fantastic tales, owes much to Garcia Marquez, sometimes even images (eggs of a certain day, news-spreading parrots).The \\"Patriarch\\" is the ur-dictator, the tyrant personified, an old man who never steps down, who rules behind a double whose death thus gives rise to a legend of immortality. The dictator's underlings invent Potemkin everything; his palace is full of cripples, blind people, lepers, and domestic animals; he is a monster who, like all the tyrants he represents, cannot love, but only cultivate power. There is his mother, who failed to be a saint, the dynamited clergyman, the roasted general, the nun-mistress, the murdered children, the wife eaten by dogs. Was there anything he did not violate or corrupt ? Garcia Marquez gives one of the best-written pictures of the corruption of absolute power. The dictator is unnamed, perhaps a composite of Colombians, perhaps more. We find Stalin in him, Hitler, Mao, Idi Amin, and Saddam Hussain. And the reaction of the crowd, the mass, is the same every time. \\"The only thing that gave us security on earth,\\" they say, \\"was the certainty that he was there....dedicated to the messianic happiness of thinking for us, knowing that we knew that he would not take any decision for us that did not have our measure...\\" In the end, they mourned him---as Russians did mourn Stalin---despite the massacres, the coups and brutal suppressions, the repression of religion, the selling off of every resource the country had---because they had wound up not knowing what would become of them without him.Brilliant imagery, product of a fantastic imagination, that pours out on the pages, seemingly with endless abundance, can only dazzle a reader. It's a stunning novel whose moral may be that \\"a lie is more comfortable than doubt, more useful than love, more lasting than truth..\\" The person who understands and exploits this is the most dangerous type of human being. Unfortunately they exist in all countries and have appeared throughout history. THE AUTUMN OF THE PATRIARCH is not really a South American, magico-realist novel, though it is that. It is a painting of the human tragedy."},{"Title":"Autumn of the Patriarch","review":"It's inevitable that this book should be somewhat off-putting compared to One Hundred Years of Solitude or Love in the Time of Cholera--Autumn of the Patriarch isn't really meant to be a 'pleasant' read. It is a grim portrait of the title character, and other characters come and go without having inner lives of their own; they have relevance only insofar as they intersect with his life. It is without a doubt one of the least novelistic novels you will ever read--indeed, in many ways it's more like a prolonged character study than a novel.Some people complain about the style in which the book is written--no paragraph breaks, few chapter breaks, long run-on sentences (the final chapter--fifty pages or so--is one massive sentence), perspective shifts mid-sentence and even mid-clause--but the truth of the matter is that, although this can become a little bit wearing at times, it is by no means 'difficult.' Not in the sense that Ulysses, Gravity's Rainbow, and Absalom, Absalom! are difficult. It can occasionally be disorienting, but in general it's always pretty easy to tell what's going on, and the style results in a surreal, dreamlike atmosphere that, I think, is perfect for describing the General's long, nightmarish reign. Sure, it could have been written in a more conventional style, and it could well have still been a good book, but Garcia Marquez's decision to push narrative boundaries provides just the right feel. After all, the General is a composite of many Meso and South American tyrants, and to couch his reign in more concrete, everyday terms would have taken away some of his universality (his selling of the Caribbean is a clear demonstration of this, as well as one of the most striking literary metaphors you'll ever encounter). He isn't really a human being; he's an implacable, negative force. For all his flailing around, occasionally making half-hearted and futile efforts to change, his life ultimately has no other meaning.Autumn of the Patriarch certainly isn't the best of Garcia Marquez's movels to start with (that would be One Hundred Years of Solitude, of course), but it's an important part of his oeuvre, even if it's not as 'fun.' I recommend it to literate people everywhere."},{"Title":"Autumn of the Patriarch","review":"In his second novel, Gabriel Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez reinvents himself in the wonderful work of &quot;Autumn of the Patriarch&quot;. The work took him 8 years to write, however the result was well worth the work. By using a stream of consiousness technique and constantly altering between first and third persons, Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez exhibits his techincal mastery. He transplants the reader into the mind and world of a dictator in an unnamed Latin American country. Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez really captures the mind and spirit of this solitary power. An important reading for understanding power in Latin America. Similar books include &quot;Senor Presidente&quot; by Miguel Angel Asturias and &quot;Reasons of State&quot; by Alejo Carpentier. This novel is particularly relevant with the circumstances surrounding ex-Chilean Dictator, Augusto Pinochet."},{"Title":"Autumn of the Patriarch","review":"Beware, those of you who have not read a Gabriel Garcia Marquez book yet! The style and literary techniques employed by the venerable author here are not, at first, user-friendly. In place of a sequence of actions, a run-on assault of descriptions tell the tale of a seemingly immortal yet completely despicable Caribbean tyrant. Sentences last for pages, each chapter is but one paragraph, the narrative perspective changes in mid-sentence, etc: This anti-traditional approach proves to be extremely rewarding, I felt the ending was even better than the build-up. Worthy of a score of Doctorate theses--but none by my hand. Upon finishing this book you will be awakened to a unique artistic literary style by one of the century's greatest authors--then go out and buy yourself some more Marquez novels. The more straightforward &quot;General in his Labyrinth&quot; and the illustrious &quot;100 Years of Solitude&quot; I also highly recommend."},{"Title":"Autumn of the Patriarch","review":"While it lacks the startling originality and narrative sweep of \\"One Hundred Years of Solitude,\\" this novel is Gabriel Garcia-Marquez's masterpiece of prose. The story is good and the many surreal touches are magnificent and deployed to great political effect (the selling of the sea, for example, is an unforgettable image of impoverished nations selling their natural resources to wealthy nations and only suffering from the transaction), but the real story here is Gabo's prose: he channels William Faulkner to create a style that's as sinuous and labyrinthine--and beautiful--as anything yet accomplished in our Western Hemisphere."},{"Title":"Autumn of the Patriarch","review":"This is a good book, don't get me wrong. And I will only speak for the English/translated version. It's a classic in fact, not just going by the author who is a brilliant man. A classic in terms of experimental writing. A first: something so original you will always remember forcing yourself through this difficult to read material. There are times where I read the same page three times, just to get the story line right. From that perspective it's timeless just as the book itself. But after a while you get the feeling as if Gabriel is toying with you. Torn between loving the old man, hating his guts, cursing his second wife, saluting his victory over himself. Anyone with any ambitions for power should read this. It's Machiavellian theme, its hidden storyline, its wonderful depictions of real and everyday life... so real, too real perhaps. But not for your everyday, easy reading pleasures. You really need to take time off to enjoy this. Sorry,"},{"Title":"Autumn of the Patriarch","review":"The people who have said this book is difficult probably just weren't prepared for it. This is second only to 100 Years as Garcia's most amazing work. Of course it's challenging. Of course much of the book is atmospheric--that's the point. It's told from the point of view of an entire country, a country that's been raped and starved and brutalized for so long it can barely remember who it is. It's a portrait of a complicated love/hate, co-dependent relationship between a nation and its caudillo. Don't try to read this if you're expecting something light for the plane, and don't read it as your first Garcia Marquez book either. I'd start with Love in the Time of Cholera, then more to 100 Years of Solitude, and then read this a year later, when you finally understand 100 Years.

Could be the hardest I will ever read. It is a discriptive Stream of Consciousness novel. What does that mean? Stream of Consciousness means that it is written as a man experiences things. It can be erratic and all over the place, like our minds. And sentences will and do go on for pages upon pages. One of the hardest things to get into. But if you do it, the rewards are great.This book is about a cruel dictator of a small Carribean island. He is at the end of his life and is trapped in his own personal coutry ruled over by a cruel dictator. He is in his own personal hell. It is a very intense story, some of the things he does and has done can utterly disgust you, but you know that there is a small chance this man could find redemption. And on and on through the story, you begin to feel sorry for this cruel, horrible man.The description of this novel is great. I would reccomend this book only after you have read perhaps more than two of his books (unlike me) and perhaps other &quot;difficult&quot; books. The book is only a little over 200 pages, but could take longer than reading The Odyssesy.All in all, another masterpiece by Mr. Garcia. I think he should get special recognition for this work.

It is, however, an examination of a despot and the wreck of his poisoned kingdom. Filled with black humour and grotesque images, it pulls the reader forward in spite of the endless sentences. One can almost see the squalor and smell the rubbish in the city.

In actuality it is a composite of several dictators including Spain's Franco.While the patriarch is a composite of all he is really none. He is a mythological creature who lives to near eternity and rules the country for over one hundred years. This however is not a plot based story. It is a rambling stream of consciousness with no paragraph indentations and sentences that ramble, curl and change pronouns. It is the confusion and chaos which happens in these countries under a mad dictator.So while it is a stunning read it is also a stumping read, often leaving the reader wondering what is happening. Here is an example of one of the shorter sentences, which gives a description of the essential patriarch:\\"Contrary to what his clothing showed, the descriptions made by historians made him very big and official schoolboy texts referred to him as a patriarch of huge size who never left his house because he could not fit through the doors, who loved children and swallows, who could guess a person's thoughts by one look in the eyes, and who had the secret of a salt with the virtue of curing lepers' sores and making cripples walk\\"Despite the difficulty in diagramming a single sentence in this book and its frequent inaccessibility, I found the book intriguing and its prose brilliant.

Reading this book is an an experience that cannot be quite likened to any other. When you are finished with it, you will be breathless, exhausted and will be left wanting more.

Will leave the reader sweating and gasping for more..."},{"Title":"Autumn of the Patriarch","review":"There is a long-standing conflict between art and popular consumption. On one hand, a novel replete with artistic vision can alienate a reader. On the other, a novel devoid of artistic experimentation and philosophical exploration leaves a reader flat, akin to eating Pop Rocks for dinner.In a recent essay, Jonathan Franzen wrote:\\"Think of the novel as lover: Let's stay home tonight and have a great time. Just because you're touched where you want to be touched, it doesn't mean you're cheap; before a book can change you, you have to love it. Or the novelist as the cook who prepares, as a gift to the reader, this many-course meal. It's not all ice cream, but saut&eacute;ed broccoli rabe has charms of its own.\\"The question then: does \\"Autumn of the Patriarch\\" succeed in giving us enough to enjoy as a balance to the artistic experimentation Garcia Marquez doles out in staggering quantity?I say no.\\"Autumn\\" is a painful read. Literally. Sentences that go on for pages. No paragraph breaks. A handful of chapter breaks. This book will hurt your eyes, cause eye strain, there's no resting place.Admittedly, there is much to like within \\"Autumn\\"'s pages. The detail of Garcia Marquez' world. The complex character of the general. The cyclical plot structure that seems to wander, but really circles. If you've read Garcia Marquez' books, you'll recognize \\"Autumn.\\"But then...why? Why create such a difficult style? What's the purpose? I've always felt that if an author deviates from standard story-telling she'd better have a good reason. And there are plenty of examples of successful \\"artistic\\" texts. Saramago's \\"Blindness.\\" Woolf's \\"The Waves.\\" Heller's \\"Catch-22\\" and Vonnegut's \\"Slaughterhouse 5.\\"Is the cyclical, surrealistic nature of Garcia Marquez enhanced by its style? If we look at other, similar texts written by the author, we see that's not the case. \\"One Hundred Years of Solitude,\\" for example, shares a similar theme and plot structure as \\"Autumn,\\" but includes a more standard structure, and I think all would agree that there's nothing lost there.Ultimately, \\"Autumn\\" feels like an authorial experiment, even a challenge, an attempt to shed readers in the wake of suffocating popularity. \\"Can I do this?\\" Yes, he can. \\"Should I do this?\\" It's his book, but I don't have to laud it."},{"Title":"Autumn of the Patriarch","review":"I recognize this book as the work of genius it actually is but I am put out of sorts by the fact that it challenges me in my way of thinking and forces me to re-read passages that are at times difficult and too unpredictble for my tv addled mind. I feel compelled to critically penalize you for confronting me with life's inherent contradiction through litterature. Mr. Marquez, you lose stars for not letting me think I am as bright as I like to think I am. Just kidding folks.... Will and Grace anyone?"},{"Title":"Autumn of the Patriarch","review":"I like Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez's literature. Three of his books are among my favorites. But this one I didn't like. I must say that I usually prefer demanding readings over &quot;light&quot; literature, so it's not the &quot;stream-of-consciousness&quot; what bored me (I love &quot;Ulysses&quot;, for example). But I did not find it interesting. 50 pages-long sentences must be really excellently crafted. I think in this work they are not. Perhaps for non-Latin Americans it is a wonderful tale about a bizarre Latin American dictator and the savage world over which he reins. But I knew right from the start that this would be a long mock and attack on dictatorships (which is perfectly fine), and I didn't want to read more. No problem, even the best artists are entitled to some bad results."},{"Title":"Autumn of the Patriarch","review":"This was the wrong book to select for a road trip even thoughI loved two of his other books, and felt up to the challenge, even so was not able to handle the tediousness of the story of a failing dictator, nevertheless, its cruel images haunt my thoughts even weeks later, and if you think this sentence is run on, you won't appreciate Marquez's style which dominates and therefore diminishes the underlying brilliance of the story."},{"Title":"Autumn of the Patriarch","review":"Once in a while, in my masochistic phases, I will read a book like Autumn of the Patriach. This is like much of Faulkner's writing: Chapters made up of single paragraphs, made up of single sentences. As I read, I annotated to show some natural breaks.I know others who can dive into this kind of book and really get something out of it. I guess I should give it another chance and exercise my brain a little more. But if I do get into it again, I have a strong temptation to rewrite it in the style of Ernest Hemingway.I have all of Garcia Marquez fiction and some nonfiction available in English. This is by far my least favorite."},{"Title":"Autumn of the Patriarch","review":"The title of my review sufficiently sums up the novel but brevity does not constitute a review in the eyes of Amazon. As far as the novels of Marquez are concerned, I have heard it said (more than a few times) that there are three masterpieces: One Hundred Years of Solitude, Love in the Time of Cholera and Chronicle of a Death Foretold - I ignored the warning and paid the price as I laboured through 'Autumn', fighting off sleep at every page."},{"Title":"Autumn of the Patriarch","review":"Unlike other writers who embed the Christian ideals and symbolism into their work to evoke mystery and majesty, Marquez uses a religious vernacular to cast the dictator into the same shadow of doubt into which he wants the reader to hold the god figure. Marquez' countless allusions to Christ and his Mother render the reader into a surrealistic land of never-ending make-believe deaths and resurrections.The Autumn of the Patriarch rends the \\"terror of the miracle\\" (p. 237) in the form of the macabre mini-miracles of Marquez' magical realism: the general who sprouts fish scales, the general's weathered skin turning into infant skin, the cows who eat from paintings, leaving little doubt that these miracles dominate the novel. What is less evident is that Marquez' assertions after these or the more debased miracles occurring in the form of tyranny are a screed against the dictatorial nature of religion. The dictator is not the anti-Christ but rather the reverse embodiment of Jesus Christ. The General of the Universe becomes the King of the Universe and neither comes out well ahead of the game in the telling.The accumulation of religious detail is sometimes so evident and overpowering that one wonders whether Marquez is merely ornamenting the Roman Catholic Latin American culture begun by Spanish clerics in the 1500s. However, religious imagery and incantation cannot convey a sense of religiosity within the dictatorship because they blaspheme rather than uphold a religious connotation of the novel. If the General \\"[remembers] suddenly that cow was written with a c\\" then Marquez also writes god with a lowercase \`g.' (p237)The General's meditations on the aloneness of power stand as counterpoint and counterpart of his partner in the game of all-powerfulness. The General does becomes Christ meandering in the desert of his solitude, wondering if his lofty perch is worth enduring. Like the General who is pained since birth with his malformed [...], Christ was born to and had no choice but to endure. For Marquez, the question is not one of endurance but rather a perdurance of \\"uncountable years.\\" The General and Christ suffer the \\"fiction of commanding without power, of being exalted without glory and of being obeyed without authority.\\" (p. 254) Marquez fuses the actions of the debased General by debasing the inauthenticity of Christ."},{"Title":"Autumn of the Patriarch","review":"When I first began reading this book I must admit that I was confused by the stream of conciousness and one sentence chapters. But what a treat it was! It's rare the book that makes you stop to re-read a phrase to yourself while you exclaim, &quot;Wow!&quot; I recommend this book to anyone who has read Gabriel Garcia before. If not, read One hundred Years of Solitude before you pick this one up. You won't regret it!"},{"Title":"Autumn of the Patriarch","review":"Written during 1968-1975, Marquez has fashioned a grand narrative of a Caribbean tyrant caught in the prison of his own power, slowly losing it and dying (with shades of Lear and Macbeth).Garcia Marquez's theme is once again solitude. The language is more like a poem than a novel -- sentences run on for pages, changing voice several times before coming to a period. This style can be irritating, forcing re-reading to find out who is speaking or acting, but it also lends a dream-like, fluid quality that perfectly embodies the ambiguity of reason and truth. In this it is Post Modern. In it's surreal content and luxuriant sensual prose (the translation by Gregory Rabassa is an inspiration), it shows who is the father of Magical Realism. It is worth reading alone for the details -- a herniated testicle that whistles, the effete torturer listening to Bruckner records, the mighty dictator napping in a hammock under tamarind trees at his mother's house while his cabinet ministers argue the fine points of law, and the final act that brings ruin on his nation -- the sale of the sea (numbered and boxed for shipping) to foreign creditors."},{"Title":"Autumn of the Patriarch","review":"After reading only a few pages of The Autumn of the Patriarch by Gabriel Garcia Marquez, I was convinced that I would go crazy if I tried to finsh this book. Believe me, I am quite fond of strange literature, but this book seemed to me the epitomy of all that can be wrong with storytelling.However, I now want to say that if you do attempt to read this book, don't let the gigantic sentences and the peculiar manner of writing lacking dialogues scare you away. To love this book, one has to accept it for what it is, and not for what it could have been.It is certainly not a happy story, but a story of life stripped of all pretenses -- the life of a man who never knew who he was, who died never knowing. It is interesting to see how the life of the cruel dictator unravels before our eyes, revealing its tragedy. It is painful to witness his inevitable and deplorable end, and we can't help but cry when M&aacute;rquez presents us with the tragic truth about the tyrant's life: that &quot;the only livable life was one of show, the one we saw from this side which wasn't his... this poor people's side.&quot; Because &quot;everyone ended up finding his place in the world, everyone except him&quot;. And when we discover the bitter truth, we plead the author, just as the dictator pleaded the bishop: &quot;I don't know the truth, promise me that.&quot;Read it, and if you do finish it, you will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Autumn of the Patriarch","review":"I personally think that &quot;One Hundred Years of Solitude&quot; is overrated; I am not particularly enamored with the whole genre of magical realism. Nevertheless, Marquez uses that style to perfection in &quot;Autumn of the Patriarch,&quot; creating a nightmarish world in which a sadistic, perhaps mentally deranged tyrant rules over a small Caribbean country. I liked the surrealist style in this book because there really is something surreal about totalitarianism. The aura of omniscience that lends legitimacy to most dictatorships is based on nothing but lies. From Joseph Stalin to Idi Amin to Kim Jong Il, tyrants throughout history have cultivated images of invincibility, machismo, wisdom, and righteousness to justify their authority. I consider such monstrous perversions of the truth perfectly reprehensible, especially considering that they are usually used to legitimize the most heinous crimes. In this book, Marquez cuts to core of totalitarinism, revealing that underneath all the grandeur lies nothing but a sick, despicable old man. The imagery in this book is grotesque to say the least, but for that reason it remains embedded in your memory. In one unforgettable scene, the dictator's lookalike is killed. The nation, unaware that the leader even has a double, thinks that he himself is dead. There is widespread jubilee on the streets. The leader reappears in public, portraying the whole event as a resurrection from the dead. He naturally slaughters those who cheered at the false news that he had died. There are many other scenes just as memorable that would take too long to relate. I guess I should conclude with the warning that this book is structured unlike any book that I have encountered. There are no paragraph breaks, the dialogue is not italicized, and the sentences consistently run for several pages. This is not so daunting as it sounds, though. The book actually does not read that difficult once you get going. It is not an easy read, no doubt, but the reward definitely exceeds the effort required."},{"Title":"Autumn of the Patriarch","review":"My favorite Marquez and high on my all-time list. Like most good prose the book is best read aloud, even sung. Consider that if you read it in English, Gregory Rabassa should share full credit for the beauty of his translation.No reviewer has mentioned the ambiguity of identity which is the central theme of this marvelous story. Early on something happens that leaves a mystery behind. Perhaps you have been mislead.The remainder of the book glitters with clues."},{"Title":"Autumn of the Patriarch","review":"Autumn of the Patriarch was a fantastic book, endemic of the classics, deep on many levels and actually better than One Hundred Years of Solitude. Much like Marquez's other work, he paints pictures and concepts in fragments of time, glimpses of memories and remembrances, and pieces of his characters personalities. The perspective and narration shift, sometimes intangibly and in mid-sentence. The effect is mosaic and powerful. He eloquently captures the essence of dictatorships and abuse and distortion of power from a distinctively non-Western perspective. The character in this novel is a composite of multiple Latin American dictators, written in the fantastic and surreal style that is Marquez and is similar to Rushdie."},{"Title":"Autumn of the Patriarch","review":"Gabriel Garcia Marquez's novel, The Autumn of the Patriarch, threw me into the sea to which he constantly referred to. The frustration in the beginning gradually swept over me, just enough so that I was able to enjoy the content of the book. Placing me in the twisted world of a disillusioned government official did more than shock me. It intrigued me, forced me to consider the world outside of my own, and tossed me into the tidal wave of symbolism, metaphor, and stream-of-conscious sentence structure. I recommend this book so that you, the reader, are able to touch upon this story that shocked the literary world beyond its wildest imagination."},{"Title":"Autumn of the Patriarch","review":"I have been a big fan of Mr. Marquez for many years now, and have read at least four of his other books. This one intrigued me when I read about it, since it is reputed to have been his first.I found the first fifty or so pages difficult to get into because, typical of Marquez, he tends to write in run on sentences, no paragraphs, and differing persons. Stick with it, however, and the book will captivate you. For anyone familiar with one or more of the dictatorships typical of South America, either past or present, you will become enthralled with his eye for detail. A great read, and an object lesson for would be dictators."},{"Title":"Autumn of the Patriarch","review":"G.G. M&aacute;rquez's book is a written version of a polyptych by Hieronymus Bosch on the universal theme of \`Evil' (on a moral, personal, political, social, economical or psychological level).The main character in this book is a solitary despot.His \`regime of infamy' is an avalanche of killings, summary executions, massacres, suicides, cruelties, tortures, horror laboratories, expulsions, explosions, illnesses, plagues, obscenities, perversions, depravations, rapes, promiscuities, corruptions, hallucinations, evil omens, doubles, apparitions, filths, putrefactions, stenches, pestilential vapors, false messages, fictionalized photographs, physical deformities, alleged miracles, bird and child cries.His most scorned enemies are men of letters, \`worse than politicians, worse than priests.'This forceful and relentless stream of (sur)real visions and violent images is a must read for all G.G. M&aacute;rquez fans and for all lovers of world literature."},{"Title":"Autumn of the Patriarch","review":"This is the tragic story of a dictator and the country he rules for 100 years. He is unwittingly installed in the seat of power by the imperialists, the fifteenth dictator in eleven years, and then he stays there for the next hundred. He realizes that he has no choice but to stay in power because if he relaxes his hold, he will either be killed or be banished forever to live a penniless, sad life, far away from his land. With every brutality he commits, he closes a door on reconcilliation. Till ironically, by the time he reaches the autumn of his life, the power structure around him wants him to stay, and he lives his last years, lonely, sorrounded by farm animals, detached from reality, watching the world on closed-circuit TV.Gabriel Garcia Marquez tells a stroy that transcends time and location, poetically capturing the brutality and loneliness of a monster and his &quot;realm of gloom&quot;. With sentences that run for pages, and no paragraphs, the book reads like more like a poem than prose. There were sections that I had to read alound to truly appreciate their beauty. And whenever, I read a page twice, I discovered a new meaning in it that I had not noticed before. Don't expect a typical novel when you open this book and you will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Autumn of the Patriarch","review":"\\"Autumn of the Patriarch\\" was a departure from the other Marquez I'd read--\\"Chronicle of a Death Foretold,\\" \\"Love in the Time of Cholera,\\" and of course \\"One Hundred Years of Solitude.\\"The narration goes on and on for pages gradually picking up steam in such a way that it reminded me of Kerouac when he was hitchiking and the things he saw and it just made me get lost in the description of things and I thought at least Proust's sentences have a central metaphor and you can keep that in mind while you're reading but with \\"Patriach,\\" one tends to get lost in the details like losing your trail in some amazonian rainforest, you're lost for pages and pages but when you finally realise what you've found and where you are it's intoxicating like the scent of a woman.................."},{"Title":"Autumn of the Patriarch","review":"This dictator combines within himself, the best and the worst, of the human being when invested with absolute power: from charity to corruption, benevolence to rape, fear of God to extreme cruelty. The (sparse) punctuation follows an almost strict fitting of the Poisson statistical distribution, page by page, and then amongst chapters, constituting this into both a textbook in literature and statistics."},{"Title":"Autumn of the Patriarch","review":"The Autumn of the Patriarch is Gabriel Garcia Marquez's third masterpiece...if you are counting Leaf Storm as one, which I am, and One Hundred Years of Solitude as two, which everyone else is (I have't read it yet).It is an awesome and prodigious work. I see four layers in the story.1. At its most basic, the story is a psychedelic oozing of mixed consciousness', a seething mass of point of view violations.2. Next, it is like the most brain-bursting collection of metaphors, images, phrasing, words, and writing that I have ever attempted to digest. Often it left me staring at the ceiling, or out the window, or just plain dazed.3. Then, there is the detailed riveting stomach-churning rubber-necking timeless classic essential portrait of the dictator. When I finish reading, I think...Gabo has captured the inner workings of every single dictator who has ever lived, still lives, is in diapers, and is yet to be born.4. And the hard reading of the sentences that go on forever, and there is no respite, and you think just the onslaught of all the words is going to make you go crazy which makes the structure of the novel as inaccessible and inscrutable as the psyche of the subject itself.Wow.I am left with memories of that patriarch wearing the denim uniform without insignia and the gold spur on the left heel, who is always dragging his feet through the government house full of chickens and cows to the latrines where he and no one else writes on the the toilets long live the general, long live the stud who after selling a sea, sought in native science the only thing that really interested him which was to discover some masterful hair-restorer for his incipient baldness whose life had been seen in the premonitory waters of basins by his mother of mine Bendicion Alvarado of my heart, he was as deaf as a post not only because I would ask him about one thing and he would answer about another but also that it grieved him that the birds were not singing when in fact it was difficult to breathe with that uproar of birds which was like walking through the jungle at dawn and they created newspapers and tv shows for him just the way that he liked them and every night he slept in his office behind three bolts, three locks, and three bars which is where they finally found him stretched out on the floor, face down, his right arm bent under his head as a pillow where he had realized at the moment of his death his incapacity for love in the enigma of the palm of his mute hands and in the invisible code of the cards and he had tried to compensate for that infamous fate with the burning cultivation of the solitary vice of power.And FINALLY, a period. That is kind of how you start to feel, and by the end of the book, you are gasping, yearning, craving, needing, dying for that little dot.Brilliant. But not light. Very heavy."},{"Title":"Autumn of the Patriarch","review":"That this is a tough read is an understatement. But worth the effort. The story is so relevant: a warning never to forget, as those who hear the word of God hustle politics, believing their own shtick. Marquez's imagination is so astounding it makes me fearful that Western civilization died a long time ago. In the best of my dreams I can only sustain for five seconds what Marquez holds together for his entire novel."},{"Title":"Autumn of the Patriarch","review":"Amazing.I have no other words describing this book. The narrative style, for those complaining - is in my humble opinion Marquez BEST : spell binding magic realism.The book details in long and convoluted sentences the minutiae of every day life of a maniac, a universal type of tyrant - which just happens to be caught in Marquez writer's cross hairs in South America. It may be one of the many South American dictators and it could easily be one of their European monster counterparts. Marquez is sometimes sublime, often bold and always funny in a strange way. Recommended !"},{"Title":"Autumn of the Patriarch","review":"I loved the novel, had to read it very slowly, carefully, and piecemeal and each sentence that I read (actually all are a few pages long) recriprocated in my thoughts till I picked the novel to read the next few sentences. The novel by Marquez is a brilliant piece of imagery that blends the nauseating, dark, dying rule and regime of a tyrant with a poetic wordplay that arouses hatred, pain, sympathy and understanding for the patriarch. The writer has written a story that delights and anguishes at the same time. The protagonist is a dictator who rules with utmost authority, through fear and iron hand but at the same time is a slave of his own power, alone and old, diseased and dying. It takes some effort to grasp the narration style of the suthor, but once a feel is developed for this incredibly complex and intricate writing style, complex emotions and life like experiences enthrall in every sentence. I thought Rushdie was brilliant, Marquez beats him hands down!This is at times a story of unfulfilled love, of solitude, of loneliness at the top, of the extremely spiteful shades of power, of grief that goes uncured, unhealed, of superstitions, lies and naked ugliness of life in corrupt regimes. Artistically, the novel is an endless potrait, with each part beautifully drawn, colored, etched, put together in perfection after painting each part with a tremendous skill, imagination and ability that is both rare to find and emulate. I am sure every avid reader will be as affected when he reads this incredible novel."},{"Title":"Autumn of the Patriarch","review":"I read this book in the original Spanish and it amazes me that the same person that could write Love in the times of Cholera which deals with love, could also write a book this violent and dark. This novel is a masterpiece because it illustrates one of Gabo's best traits as a novelist, his ability to describe. The dictator's name is never actually revealed but the reader is thrust into his paranoid, paralyzed world of pain and suffering. He's seperated from the rest of humanity. It becomes apparent that the dictator's evil and hatred overtake him.It's obvious that Gabo used his experiences with tyrants such as Franco, Stalin, Trujillo, and Castro while writing this novel. They would serve him well as the main character of this novel is a combination of all of the aforementioned leaders. The traits of the dictator are not just limited to leaders of state but also to anybody who allows corruption, greed, and violence overtake them. In the end, this novel is difficult to read but a neccesary oeuvre of one of the best Spanish language novelists of our time."},{"Title":"Autumn of the Patriarch","review":"Garcia's story, to borrow from the text itself, is its own herniated testicle. Each page is inflated, yet strangely it may be our badge of unusual and distinctive honor to reach the ending. The text is the patriarch, the sole dictation, every voice indistinguishable from each other's, and we chosen readers soon find ourselves its sole constituency.So how else does one approach narrating a Caribbean dictatorship? Nice and pat and publisher-friendly? Such that \\"reader response\\" will cast a vote in the author's or characters' favor? Should it be written in order to please a publisher's project management timetable? Surely not, for no self-respecting dictator ever allows other ideologues into his inner circle than the mistrusted and select few. And such as it is, Garcia correctly adopts the only allowable narrative trope. What's more, horrifyingly we should note that these grotesque and endearing passages--the formidable blocks of text a hooked reader cannot easily quit--is the unlikelihood of such a work being published were written today.Politics aside, if and when you may arrive at a point in the novel where you are scratching your head, it might be helpful to consider the work as its own community of voices. And this place may very likely be shortly after beginning. Communities are ever so much deeper than the politics that govern them.After a bit of reading, perhaps a little like Burgess's A Clockwork Orange, Garcia's delivery begins to become sensible. After all, why should he obey grammatical and lexical conventions of his time? Autumn of the Patriarch is an outright attack of totalitarianism in literature, and totalitarianism simply cannot be understood within a normal frame of reference. For more on this subject, please refer to essays of the same kind by Hannah Arendt. Additionally, considering some of the recent avant-garde poetry of New York's Nuyorican movement, a school of poetry that regards language itself as a patriarchal syntactical institution at the core, it is likely that Garcia works with this very same principle, redefining or at least defying what literature is supposed to be, who should write it, whose work should be considered for publication, and what is lawful in print.These are simply some speculations, and there is much to speculate. As with One-hundred Years of Solitude, Autumn of the Patriarch is steeped in fantastic, endless and rich descriptions, the contemporary likes of which are found only in a Garcia novel. Unlike One-hundred Years, however, I cannot characterize this piece as endearing or captivating in the same way. It is a much darker, but it is Garcia unmistakably. I would also not recommend reading this at bedtime as a sleep-aid, for though Garcia's grammar eventually becomes perfectly clear, there are few convenient places to quit reading. Pages and pages pass without periods. And period stops are for easy, individual thoughts--like mine stopping here."},{"Title":"Autumn of the Patriarch","review":"The Autumn of the Patriarch is perhaps one of the greatest works of literary artistry of the twentieth century and certainly one of his most innovative works, but most likely it won't appeal to the general reader because of its unconventional structure. The main character, a tyrant of a small country, is the only 'real' character in this book, in that being the supreme leader and dictator of his world and all that surrounds him, he 'owns' all that the novel encompasses, yet his comprehension of life is riddled within a strange shroud of misguided purpose and a directionless ego. Marquez distorts the boundaries in many aspects of his writing structure so that it seems a blending of actions and thoughts that are being portrayed in order to show with full effect this dictators life through all characters and descriptions, sometimes switching between first and third person within the same sentence, giving a sense of the often displaced and cold objectivity of this man. There is an interesting contrast here, as his world is a concentricity of solitude and paranoia, yet a free and rich world grows around him that he seems to never really be able to touch. This book is confusing to many people upon their first reaction, because it is a work of multi-faceted characteristics, packed with symbolic despcription and living sentences, all coming together to create a very unique work. This novel should, perhaps, be absorbed more than studied, as you can spend a lot of time trying to figure out the structure of it in order to form a linear perspective of what you are reading, but it's probably a waste of time once you realize that everything presented here lends to the broader environment instead of single plot turns or actions. I have read comments upon the complexity of this novel, which is understandable if one is used to reading the standard serial novel that we come to expect, but if you can grasp the kind of picture Marquez is trying to paint, it makes the novel a much simpler and enjoyable piec! e of art."},{"Title":"Autumn of the Patriarch","review":"This novel, written in a stream of incessant imagery of beauty and cruelty, is a masterpeice of narrative skill. One must be 'in the mood' to tackle the work which is dense and whose language is difficult at first. I say at first because, once underway, and the narrative understood, the book unfolds like a dream.This book is a testament to Marquez's skill. The events that take place (three hundred donkey-pulled pianos falling into a ravine/ the attempt to hide two thousand children)are almost beyond comprehension. I finished the book last night and was beside myself. The use of language and imagery will stay with me forever. This book alone should've earned Marquez his Nobel prize.And don't think the style of the novel is pretensious or used to make something easy difficult. There are many literary devices at play but all to serve the purpose of the story.This book should also be interesting for anyone curious about the lonliness and insanity of despotism.And don't be fooled by Oprah and the critics, 'One Hundred Years of Solitude' is NOT his best book by any means. \\"The Autumn of the Patriarch\\" is where 'magical-realism' really comes to life.For anyone intersted in contemporary literature or something wholly original, this novel is a must."},{"Title":"Autodesk Inventor R3 Fundamentals: Conquering the Rubicon","review":"&quot;Rubicon&quot; thoroughly meets its stated goal of being a reference guide and supplement to formal instruction.

El estilo de Juan Rulfo es coinciso y exacto. No conozco otro escritor que pueda decir tanto en tan pocas palabras. Sus frases son memorables, como epitafios que describen los m&aacute;s profundos sentimientos de verguenza y culpa, contra los cuales sus personajes siempre luchan.Le&iacute; este par de libros en mi adolescencia y siempre vuelvo a ellos.

Y, precisamente, la genialidad radica en este aspecto. A pesar de no emplear palabras elaboradas, la novela es extremadamente compleja por la anacronia. La mezcla de los diversos recursos literarios para describir la situacion hacen al lector pensar en el significado de lo qye Juan Rulfo trata de decir.Otro aspecto interesante radica en que la novela retrata con fidelidad la cultura mexicana, desde la muerte hasta por el lenguaje y forma de actuar de los protagonistas de la historia.

De las mejores novelas mexicanas del siglo XX, del mexicano Juan Rulfo, uno de los grandes narradores de la narrativa hispanoamericana.

Not only is some of the artwork gruesome, but the story fails to deliver anything close to the original message of how gold (or make-substitution-here) is not the end-all of life.In Well's version, Ruby tells her little brother about an 'ancient' Max (Midas), who instead of turning everything into gold with a touch, turns everyone into dessert with his laser eyes. Mom is zapped. Dad is zapped, and there is no sign of regret until sister is changed into a slice of cake. Then, without explanation, there is a sudden change of heart. (I guess one can only conclude that it was okay to zap mom and dad but not sis.)The text is not the only problem though. The pictures of Max and his blood-red eyes are strange. Supposedly laser light, the emanations stream down in arches, not in straight lines. It looks more like Max is leaking blood from his eyes.

A seemingly straightforward investigation of the murder of a young Irish woman, stabbed to death with a wooden pitchfork on the Cliffs of Moher, has quickly turned into an international conspiracy involving secret cells of the IRA, money-laundering, and plans for a major terror attack in the Emerald Isle.McGarr's investigation of the murder of May Quirk, a reporter for a New York newspaper, reveals the wide variety of people affected by her death and their interactions--educated young Irish emigres now living in New York, sad and frustrated old folks tending small farms in County Clare, owners of local dance halls and pubs in Lahinch, misguided supporters of the IRA, crooks threatened by May's investigations, and even her German boyfriend with his Irish roots.McGarr, his wife Noreen, and his officers--Hugh Ward, Bernie McKeon, and Liam O'Shaughnessy--whom we know from two previous novels, continue to develop their personal relationships in parallel with the ongoing IRA investigation. McGarr, who is not averse to having a jar with the lads, even the bad lads, is an honest investigator who shows his emotions and is willing to get \\"down and dirty,\\" if necessary. He himself admits to interpreting the law on terms that are \\"somehow fairer than the cold print on the pages of the law books,\\" in order to effect a just outcome. The action is fast, the plot is exciting, and the characters, with all their quirks and idiosyncrasies, are unforgettable.Author Gill's eye for revealing detail, his colorful dialogue with all its colloquialisms, his perceptive recreation of unique settings and atmosphere, and the loving humor of his observations make this novel a lively and memorable evocation of characters and places we have come to know as part of this sixteen-book series. This novel has been recently reprinted under the title Death of an Irish Lass.

Nature and Mysticism combine with Science to make a very educational read."},{"Title":"Who Ordered the Jumbo Shrimp?","review":"Oxymorons are, of course, words or phrases that are inherently contradictory: &quot;jumbo shrimp&quot;, for example. Jon Agee has taken everyday phrases that so easily fall from all our lips and made us realize how delightfully ridiculous they really are. A scorched and burned man stands at his refrigerator while fire shoots from the top compartment. Why, it's FREEZER BURN, of course!! How about a group of drivers pulling their racecars?? Yup, you got it: that's DRAG RACE for you.Mr. Agee is perhaps better known for his children's books, \\"Dmitri the Astronaut\\" and \\"If Snow Comes\\", but he's also a master of wordplay, with three other books of palindromes (words or phrases that are spelled the same way forward as backwards) and a book of anagrams (words that can be spelled with the same letters: \\"Elvis Lives\\"). These books of oddities of English would be as at home in a classroom as on the living room shelf. Indeed, as a teacher, I often pull one or two of his works into class to get the creative juices flowing with my students as they try to compose their own anagrams, palindromes and oxymorons.While the book is by no means complete--there are hundreds of oxymorons--it is one of the few published books of contradictory phrases and certainly the only one I know that is illustrated! While I would have liked to see some of the more \\"controversial\\" ones (you know, the one's that might--GASP!!-- offend someone, like \\"military intelligence\\", \\"friendly fire\\" or \\"athletic scholarship\\"), the book is definitely recommended to add to your collection, whether you're a wordsmith or not."},{"Title":"Who Ordered the Jumbo Shrimp?","review":"Who Ordered the Jumbo Shrimp? is a hilarious book.

Not much, and this book is mostly a joy to read. It made me want to visit some of the same far-flung places and help cheer on the valiant winemakers doing such remarkable things. One exasperating thing about this book, though: the type is a deadly combination of tiny and pale, which makes it very tough on the eyes. Perhaps there wasn't enough ink on the press when my copy was printed, but it seems more like an intentional choice by a designer with the eyes of a 25-year-old rather than those of someone over 50.

Al leer otros comentarios aqu&iacute; expuestos, una vez m&aacute;s me parece curioso como todo fanatismo siempre se hace tan obvio, como todo fundamentalismo niega la verdad del otro sin m&aacute;s ni m&aacute;s. Muchos de esos que se dicen seguidores de la Biblia, son tan estrechos de mente y de conciencia religiosa, que ven en todo aquel que cuestione su fe, un enemigo; su paranoia no les deja m&aacute;s que pensar sino que todos los que no comparten su culto est&aacute;n errados y que los que hablan en t&eacute;rminos espirituales sin ser Jesucristo, son falsos profetas y enviados de Satan&aacute;s. Me pregunto, y les pregunto: es que acaso los que tienen la Biblia como su libro sagrado pueden demostrar que su Dios es EL DIOS? Nadie lo puede hacer. Hay muchas interpretaciones de Dios, y todas v&aacute;lidas en cuanto pertenecientes a la tradici&oacute;n cultural de los diferentes pueblos. Cada etnia y civilizaci&oacute;n en el mundo y a trav&eacute;s de los tiempos ha demostrado que no existe una &uacute;nica verdad y que la mente humana no asume una &uacute;nica verdad, y menos, la religiosa.

The recipes range from traditional \\"Yankee\\" fare, such as Indian pudding, to recipes from more exotic lands, such as sate from Indonesia. While some of the dishes are fairly complex, all of the recipes are easy to follow and many reflect the bounty of western Massachusetts, notably maple syrup, rhubarb, and apples.The best elements of the book for me, however, are Tinky's evocation of life in rural \\"West County\\". Having spent childhood vacations with family in the area, I enjoyed seeing references to seasonal celebrations (Yankee Doodle Days), regionalisms (people from Heath are known as \\"Heathens\\"), and comments about places I regard fondly (the Mohawk Trail and Shelburne Falls' Bridge of Flowers). While the region has become remarkably cosmopolitan in recent years, and the recipes reflect that, it is the evocation of long ago that touched my heart.Judith Russell's illustrations grace and complement the text with a delightful folk art quality.

(Well, maybe not the maple ones!) That's how good they all sound. But, more than that, this is no ordinary cookbook. Make no mistake about it, this is not an encyclopedia of cooking techniques. The recipes are written in a style suggesting special treats, shared between friends and scribbled on the backs of envelopes. The whimsical comments that accompany each recipe, show a writing skill that mere listing of ingredients could never provide, making it a nifty read, even for the non-cook. In Judith Russell's quaint paintings and sketches, there is always some small detail to delight, as well as a charming look at a New England neighborhood. Granny Toad lives on in these works by the late Judy R. As for the food represented wihin the covers of The Pudding Hollow Cookbook, the choice is broad; Old timey (Sally Lunn, etc.), current favorites (pasta salads, Tex-Mex etc.) and some that must be traditional family favorites.

This tool is nice because he can watch the examples over and over again until he understands them. The examples pause and then can be manually started again. It is especially helpful in learning to deal with those pesky word problems.I believe that the product is targeted to those students that are having trouble with begining Algebra.

This usually happens when one of my coworkers with kids is confronted with a math problem that stumps them, and they refer to me for &quot;guidance!&quot; Since I was recently in such a situation, I decided to browse Amazon&#65533;s selection of review material for algebra and found Longstreet&#65533;s CD &quot;Algebra: A Visual Approach&quot; and decided to try it.I liked the motion graphics approach to teaching. It tended to focus attention on method better than a text would. It also gave the student the opportunity to make an attempt to solve the problem and use the program&#65533;s solution to check their own work, much like programmed learning texts do. The approach also left the &quot;page&quot; less cluttered with extraneous material that can sometimes be distracting rather than helpful.On the down side, and a serious defect in my opinion, the material covered was too brief, and there were too few problems for the student to solve independently. In fact, the problems for the student to solve are the demonstration problems just solved by the program instructor, which tended to make it too repetitious and lacking in challenge. There was also no &quot;test&quot; of the overall course content to gage the student&#65533;s understanding of and ability to apply the material.The subject matter is a little too simple for a review of the subject by someone who has already studied algebra to a higher level. It might help new students to understand it a little better, especially those who require more active participation in their learning and who are captivated by computers to begin with.

He was a \\"red-faced man who sat on a hickory trunk, and he gave terrible names to wonderful things like toad and snake and skunk.\\" He's the one responsible for all those terribly complicated English words like \\"sphere\\" and \\"xylophone\\" (and, I'm presuming, \\"abbreviation\\").One day, while Fibblestax was talking to Carr beside a stream, he mentions that \\"this goobywickus in my cup, it looks more like cream.\\" Fibblestax also notes that other things seem misnamed to him; \\"hootch-baroos\\", for example, look more like birds and the word \\"flowers\\" sounds much better than Carr's word, \\"gunnywunks.\\"A naming contest ensues between the sour Carr and the kind Fibblestax as to who will be the namer of all things. When the mayor asks what should be the name of the wet stuff that falls from the sky, Carr proposes to call it \\"droog\\" while Fibblestax quietly suggests it should be called \\"rain.\\" You can guess what the ending will be the outcome of such a contest, with Carr suggesting names like \\"Poonies\\" for soup crackers and other ridiculous words.\\"Fibblestax\\" is one of those rare gems in picture books, a blend of wonderful text and fantastically rich illustrations. Ms. Darnell lavishly illustrates each page in muted colors and soft crosshatch. The characters are gently and realistically rendered, from the scruffy Carr in his red cap and long boot who resembles a cross between a pirate and a lumberjack, and the soft-spoken, tousle-haired Fibblestax. The text is easy, large and rhymes in a way that will easily draw any child into the story.For any child who may have asked, \\"mommy, where do words come from?\\" or who has ever invented their own words for something, \\"Fibblestax\\" is an excellent choice to add to the collection. Highly recommended from this teacher and wordsmith!!"},{"Title":"Fibblestax","review":"I am the charge nurse for a large surburban pediatric practice.

Karol Ladd gives us tools for what to do - not just want not to do. She weaves in plenty of Bible verses which serve to encourage, teach and provide hope - and she does it so easily, I am encouraged to read my Bible more. She points us to God and reminds us continually (without pounding it in with a hammer) that he is in charge and we must rest in him. She specifically tells us that no matter what the choices we make in life, God is always with us and that we should not spend time regretting something we cannot change, but with Him make the best of it from today forward. And that is just one example from this book full of encouragement and hope that we can all be positive women, full of wisdom, joy, love, courage, hope and more.You can read this book a few pages at a time, a chapter or section at a time and still be blessed. It provokes thought, draws you closer to God and lifts you up. Her examples are helpful and don't cause you to lose focus. Rather, they enhance the Scriptures she uses (as examples should) and help you to apply what she is teaching in your own life. At the end of every chapter, and sometimes even within a chapter, she describes an activity that helps us in our daily walk. For example, listing all the things that bring us joy - or, as I did, simply visualizing them as we drive to work. The chapter on courage tells us that we have nothing to fear - and it gives several Bible verses where God has provided comfort by stating he has gone ahead of us - and Karol reminds us that we should cling to these verses when faced with fear. This chapter's activity is sitting down and writing out our fears, deciding what is in our own power to change and then giving the rest of it to God.This book is great for any woman - whether you're single, married without kids or a mother. Being a working wife with no kids (on purpose) I find so few Christian books that I can relate to and be encouraged by. While the author uses her daughters and husband to illustrate points, she also uses friends, neighbors and acquaintances which makes for a good balance since no matter our lifestyle or family make-up, we all have younger and older family members, friends and neighbors.She has provided tools for memorizing Scripture, tips for prayer and simple activities to apply what's in the book to our lives - to remind us of our sources of joy, our blessings, etc. There is so much more in this book than I could possibly summarize here.This book has been a blessing to me. Thanks, Karol!!"},{"Title":"The Power Of A Positive Woman","review":"I just completed reading this book with a group of women at a friend's church and I just purchased 4 copies to give as gifts to women I care about.Ladd does a tremendous job of giving all women hope of being more positive no matter the circumstances.

The pros: I do agree with the other customers who said it was easier to read than the PDR. More comprehensive than the PDR.

Unfortunately some of them are rare drugs which aren't used for many people such as &quot;Trental&quot; or &quot;Clindamycin.&quot; These drugs are listed, but they note that: &quot;This profile has been shortened to make room for more widely used medicines.&quot; I understand the book is well over a 1000 pages, but having shortened reviews of meds wasn't the most pleasing thing.--I do need complete info for these particular drugs and was not able to get it from this guide. I did not see this problem with the PDR. On the Whole: What I do like about this book the most is that everything about it is very logical.

While it does not include every substantial work ever published on each artist, and lacks citations for many artists one would expect to be included (esp. modern and contemporary artists), it is a fine and useful resource for serious students, librarians, or book collectors."},{"Title":"UC THE GOLDEN BALL AND OTHER STORIES (Winterbrook Edition)","review":"A collection of 15 short stories, none of which feature any of Christie's recurring characters, not even the small fry like Ariadne Oliver. Although the code of ettiquette that she and her fellow writers such as Dorothy L. Sayers followed for mysteries forbade any supernatural elements, Christie could and did occasionally dabble in such stories outside the mystery format. Several of the stories here have such elements; specifically, those from THE HOUND OF DEATH AND OTHER STORIES. Others are more conventional; several of these feature men who 'seize the golden ball of opportunity' and get something out of their adventures, if only some self-respect. They are sorted by the original publication dates in magazines or story collections.\\"The Hound of Death\\", \\"The Gipsy\\", \\"The Lamp\\", \\"The Strange Case of Sir Andrew Carmichael\\", and \\"The Call of Wings\\" are all taken from an earlier collection, THE HOUND OF DEATH AND OTHER STORIES (see). Properly speaking, by the way, \\"The Strange Case of Sir Andrew Carmichael\\" is really \\"The Strange Case of Sir Arthur Carmichael\\" - it isn't often that the *title* of a story is the subject of a widespread printer's error.\\"The Girl in the Train\\", \\"Jane in Search of a Job\\", \\"The Manhood of Edward Robinson\\", \\"The Listerdale Mystery\\", \\"The Rajah's Emerald\\", \\"Swan Song\\", \\"A Fruitful Sunday\\" - taken from an earlier collection, THE LISTERDALE MYSTERY (see its reviews for details of each). \\"The Girl on the Train\\" is essentially similar to \\"The Golden Ball\\", although the settings differ. \\"Jane in Search of a Job\\" and \\"The Listerdale Mystery\\" each involve a woman - one young, one middle-aged - in desperate financial straits answering an advertisement that's too good to be true. \\"The Manhood of Edward Robinson\\" and \\"The Rajah's Emerald\\" each involve a young man with a girlfriend who's tiresome about money (one is bossy and prudent, the other likes to live higher than her boyfriend can afford) who accidentally gets hold of stolen gemstones and must think quickly to avoid wrongful arrest. \\"A Fruitful Sunday\\" starts out on a similar tack, but with a sympathetic girlfriend who *isn't* keen on giving the stones back. \\"Swan Song\\", the only story not featuring someone who's struggling, concerns a soprano with a fiendish 'temperament' and her final, definitive performance of _Tosca_.\\"Magnolia Blossom\\" (March 1926) Theodora Darrell and Vincent Easton had fallen in love under the branches of the magnolia tree at her home in London, and now, 2 weeks later, she's prepared to run away with him to his home in the Transvaal - until she sees a newspaper account of the collapse of her husband's firm. She can't leave, today of all days. Then Richard Darrell (who hasn't got a clue) asks her to persuade a man into giving her the evidence of his own criminal conduct: Vincent Easton.\\"The Golden Ball\\" (1934) Nothing to do with the fairy tale of the same name. George Dundas, like George Rowland (see above) has just been fired by his uncle, for taking an unscheduled day off in the middle of the week, and been read a lecture about 'seizing the golden ball of opportunity'. When he encounters society beauty Mary Montressor on the street outside the office, he's in a mood to take whatever adventure comes to him...\\"Next to a Dog\\" - Joyce, left widowed by a beloved husband whose only flaw was that he gambled, is too proud to sponge, but can't take just any kind of job, because she's still got someone to care for: her beloved, half-blind old terrier, Terry, a gift from her late husband. Governesses and companions can't have such dogs; what can she do to keep their heads above water?"},{"Title":"UC THE GOLDEN BALL AND OTHER STORIES (Winterbrook Edition)","review":"This is early Christie and definitely a product of its time. Much more personal than her regular mystery stories, these exude '20s style and mysticism. The first half of the book seems devoted to young people and adventure, with a great deal of attention to the recurring motif of the car representing freedom and the jewels imbuing their wearers with special traits.In the second half, Christie delves deeper and deeper into the occult, going from Atlantis theories to reincarnation to &quot;the gift&quot; to metamorphosis to the ghostly sobbing of dead children. Even as I reject the pushiness of the occult aspects of these stories, I am thoroughly entertained by Christie's writing style. Her dialogue is simply enchanting, and even though I recognize the flaws in this collection, I find myself often drawn to re-reading it to escape into a whole different world."},{"Title":"UC THE GOLDEN BALL AND OTHER STORIES (Winterbrook Edition)","review":"Agatha Christie wrote some astonishing and superb mystery books -- this is not one of them.Here we have a compendium of \\"Christie Crumbs,\\" short pieces which never blossomed into larger mystery stories. Herein, you'll find elements of and thoughts from Christie's larger works but none of them seem to manifest into anything significant. A number of the endings just sort of hang you out, reminiscent of some of the stories that you might encounter in \\"Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine,\\" only not so entertaining as those great little, well-edited tales.This book would be okay to take along for the morning bus ride or to the doctor's office. But unless you are a totally devoted Christie fan and must read everything that she wrote, I'd take a pass on this one and go with one of her more renowned works."},{"Title":"UC THE GOLDEN BALL AND OTHER STORIES (Winterbrook Edition)","review":"The fifteen stories gathered in \\"The Golden Ball\\" by Agatha Christie are far from her typical mystery stories. Rather they are tales about seeking adventure and finding romance, almost every non-mystery story summed up with a happy ending. Yet even with these more mundane stories, Christie managed to craft some unique twists into her traditional plot lines.Some of the standouts of this collection are \\"The Lamp\\" which is the story of a woman unafraid to purchase a supposedly haunted house, until her young son speaks of seeing a lonely little boy looking for a playmate. Her fears come to a head when her son becomes ill and it seems as if nothing can be done for him. \\"The Strange Case of Sir Andrew Carmichael\\" is a doctor's recollection of a unique case of amnesia of sorts, where a young man has suddenly lost his memory and behaves in the strangest of manners. The doctor is convinced that Andrew's stepmother has something to do with his condition, as well as the ghostly gray cat he keeps hearing at night. \\"Jane in Search of a Job\\" is a delightful adventure romp through 1920s England and \\"Swan Song\\" lights up a darker side of the grudges that people can carry as an opera singer puts on a show no one will ever forget.There are a few somewhat lackluster stories in the collection, ones that feel more like the Mary Westmacott side of Agatha Christie. Others that deal with strange supernatural beliefs seem a bit dated for our time. However, it is interesting to see the non-mystery side of Christie every once in a while, if only to prove that she was a first rate writer no matter the subject."},{"Title":"UC THE GOLDEN BALL AND OTHER STORIES (Winterbrook Edition)","review":"The short stories in this collections all follow the same theme - penniless but good natured girl/guy is cast out into the world by death of family/meanspirited uncle/society but manages to find good fortune in 10 pages or less. There are a couple diamonds in the rough here (title story is one), but this book is more for a Christie collector, not for a mystery reader."},{"Title":"UC THE GOLDEN BALL AND OTHER STORIES (Winterbrook Edition)","review":"Each of these short stories is gripping, leaping into unique times and places and situations with rapidity and color and few wasted words. I enjoyed every story in the collection, in spite of the occasionally semi-tiresome occult dabbling, and I retain only admiration for Agatha Christie as a writer. But, as I have written elsewhere, I do wonder what in the heck motivated her. To me I would find it extremely dull to be a mystery writer. Occasionally reading mystery, however, is a whole different thing. It's like being spoon-fed good chocolate; from time to time it's a good balm for the soul. Helps me relax. That doesn't mean I'd want to spoon-feed others, though. What led her to be so focused and obsessed. The mystery of Agatha Christie...One wee criticism: I think the book would be well-served by adding a little italicized intro to each story. Tell what year it was written, where it was written, where it was first published, and any other little tidbits about it. Just a single paragraph. Give more context, flavor."},{"Title":"UC THE GOLDEN BALL AND OTHER STORIES (Winterbrook Edition)","review":"I thought I would love this, but like an earlier reviewer said, the supernatural mysteries were a bit disappointing. When I read a Christie mystery, I want to find out who did it in the end. When she writes the supernatural ones, the ending is left a bit unexplained, which I found aggravating. Also, some stories have a sad ending, which seems unusual compared with her other works."},{"Title":"UC THE GOLDEN BALL AND OTHER STORIES (Winterbrook Edition)","review":"Very good collection of stories. Lots of fun to read in short snippets."},{"Title":"UC THE GOLDEN BALL AND OTHER STORIES (Winterbrook Edition)","review":"\\"The Golden Ball and Other Stories\\" is a wonderful collection of stories by Dame Christie. Full of charm and written with twists reminiscent of O. Henry, this book is great for anyone who loves Christie's work or anyone who loves a well-crafted short story."},{"Title":"UC THE GOLDEN BALL AND OTHER STORIES (Winterbrook Edition)","review":"Some of Agatha's most insightful, penetrating writing. The varying tales run the gamut from hilarious, playful, romantic to downright spooky in places. Plus two of them in particular are heart breaking. (I won't reveal which ones.) A really nice addition to her heavy collection, these pieces will stick with you long after you put them down. And yes: one of them even brought me to tears. Here's strong evidence Christie was more than just a one note author. The stories could very well be classified as literary gems."},{"Title":"UC THE GOLDEN BALL AND OTHER STORIES (Winterbrook Edition)","review":"These stories hit the same basic theme over and over: good honest people down on their luck are miraculously rescued by a chance encounter with a wealthy benefactor. The phrase &quot;there was nothing of the Socialist in him/her,&quot; a Christie favorite, recurs. The writing style may have passed for suave and worldly at one time, but now just seems silly. It reminds me of low-rent porn fiction. Not good at all."},{"Title":"In the wilderness","review":"These essays, as suggested by the title, tell tales of life in the forest. The narrator, a neighbor of Mark Twain and Harriet Beecher Stowe, describes his experiences on camping trips, hunting trips and the like. They're very different essays from the modern variety; today they'd probably be classified as short stories, instead. Although Warner does make clear his distaste for humanity's killing wildlife, he does not go into deep issues as is the fashion in today's popular essays. He just tells generally peaceful, sometimes humorous stories. I can best describe them as relaxing. I wouldn't recommend this for someone looking for piercing nineteenth-century insight into life, but I would for someone who wants to curl up with a Victorian story."},{"Title":"In the wilderness","review":"As a new Kindle owner, I was curious to find some free books (still hoping to recoup that $200 cost!) and stumbled upon this one. As a lover of the Adirondacks, aspiring 46er (30 down!), and amateur ADK historian, stumbling upon this gem was a treat!I had read the essay on Old Mountain Phelps before, so that one was no surprise. But the rest of these short stories were a wonderful portrait of what the mountains once were. As an earlier reviewer commented, the story of the deer hunt was an outstanding \\"thriller\\" that had me on the edge of my seat the whole time.All in all, I'd recommend this to anyone stuck in an office who'd rather be pitching a tent out in the mountains. It's about as good as one can get during the week!Bonus: The style of the essays has made them an excellent companion (via text-to-speech) for my morning ride!"},{"Title":"In the wilderness","review":"Warner writes a handleful of essays about the Adirondacks Keene Valley and High Peaks area. Essays have very relaxed feel and Warner's description of the wilderness makes you want to pick up and go camping. An underlying theme throughout is mans destructive abilities toward the natural world. These remarks are are not dwelled upon however. One memorable essay is his description of a deer being pursued by hounds; all from the deers prespecctive. Another is a story of a legandary hidden cave on Nipple Top which the author ventures to with the wily Old Man Phelps."},{"Title":"In the wilderness","review":"Mr Warner has a wonderful way &#34;explaining&#34; the great outdoors. This is a light and funny easy reader. I would recommend to anyone who enjoys the great outdoors."},{"Title":"In the wilderness","review":"When you read the title of this book you think of lessons of how to live in the ADK.In reality it is the ramblings and far fetched stories of a man with cabin fever"},{"Title":"In the wilderness","review":"This book was fairly interesting and was worth reading to the end. There were some pretty funny parts but the writing was very dated and may not appeal to all readers. If you enjoy stories that were written many years ago and in the style of that period, you may well enjoy reading this book."},{"Title":"Lady's Maid - A Novel Of The Nineteenth Century","review":"I began reading the book (a library copy) while staying with a friend who had checked it out and only got as far as the first few chapters before I went home. I finally got my hands on my own copy and finished it in a matter of a couple of days. What a treasure!Forster truly captures the feelings and struggles between the servant-class and the gentry of the era. Too often with books and movies of the period we only see the servants as floating background characters that announce guests, deliver tea-trays, and see to the horses. We forget that often these are humans with feelings and difficult lives.We see Wilson torn from everything she holds dear in the course of the story. Each time she loses, she steels her resolve and is stronger, but more cynical over time. Yet her devotion to the Browning family never wavers. Elizabeth Barrett Browning holds Wilson in thrall; and for the most part the reverse is true as well.A touching, sad tale."},{"Title":"Lady's Maid - A Novel Of The Nineteenth Century","review":"As an English teacher, I'm ashamed to admit that I knew very little about either Elizabeth Barrett or Robert Browning before picking up this book. The story of their maid, Lily Wilson, gives an interesting perspective on the private life of Elizabeth and Robert. And I admired that Forster depicted the two famous literary figures as she saw to be accurate, rather than glamorizing and glorifying them as there might be a temptation to do. The two poets are very human, often fussy, melodramatic, and given to self-aggrandizement. That made me all the more interested in the story of Lily and the difference in their lifestyle and hers, and of course their indifference to the way they treated her. It's been a while since I read something like Jane Austen, so it was refreshing and fascinating to dip back into a world with social codes so different from ours today. This book must have taken years to research, and Forster's depiction of Victorian life shows the evidence of that research.There was a page-long afterword that explained which parts of the book were true, but I wanted more. I wish Margaret Forster had written more books like this! You won't be sorry you picked it up."},{"Title":"Lady's Maid - A Novel Of The Nineteenth Century","review":"that pulls the reader into the very essence of Wilson's life as a &quot;lady's maid to Miss Elizabeth Barrett Browning&quot; during the 1860's. Although one wants to shake some sense into Wilson, one cannot help but to empathize with her depression over her separation from her child and her being &quot;turned out&quot; from her service. This is a wonderful novel that will encase the reader's complete attention from the first page until the last."},{"Title":"Lady's Maid - A Novel Of The Nineteenth Century","review":"In 1844, Lily Wilson becomes lady's maid to Elizabeth Barrett, invalid daughter of a wealthy, overbearing London merchant. Elizabeth became a recluse, corresponding and eventually meeting the poet Robert Browning. Because her father disapproved of his children marrying, Elizabeth eloped with Robert to Italy.The story is half about Elizabeth Barrett Browning and half about Lily. I found the details of EBB's life to be much more interesting than that of Wilson's, and I wish there was more about her in this novel. I got the feeling that Wilson never really had a life of her own--everything she did was connected in some way with her mistress. However, I'd like to think that this was characteristic of the period--good servants didn't really have lives of their own. Nonetheless, Wilson seemed to get herself into a lot of romantic entanglements that made me wonder what the point of it was. The writing style of the book is very dense, and it took me a long time to get through--much longer than it normally takes me to read a 550-page book. I also thought that about 200 pages could have been cut from the novel--it just seemed to drag on a bit.Nevertheless, there were a couple of things I enjoyed about this book, not the least of which was the setting--Victorian England and Italy never fail to interest me. I also liked the author's message about choice--Wilson could have learned a thing or two from her mistress."},{"Title":"Lady's Maid - A Novel Of The Nineteenth Century","review":"I read Forster's definitive biography of Elizabeth BarrettBrowning. When I heard about this book, I was a littleskeptical, but remembered what a great biograher Foresterwas. Boy was I blown away. It not only presentsan &quot;insider's view&quot; of the relationship between these people,but it also sheds light on the role of women and &quot;servants&quot;in Victorian society. A book well worth reading."},{"Title":"Lady's Maid - A Novel Of The Nineteenth Century","review":"I picked up this book at a used book store not really knowing anything about Elizabeth Barrett Browning. I loved this book. It was an interesting point of view, one I truly enjoyed, perhaps more than if it had been from EBB herself. The book is long but did not seem it; it did slow down just a tad in the end, but I have nothing but good things to say about this book. The author really captured the language of the time and it was excellently written. If you like historical fiction, I highly recommend this one."},{"Title":"Lady's Maid - A Novel Of The Nineteenth Century","review":"I knew next to nothing about the subject matter of this book when my mother lent it to me (she loved it as well). Forster is able to completely personalize the social constrictions of Victorian society through the eyes of Wilson, Lady's Maid to the poet Elizabeth Barrett Browning. Honestly enjoyable and a treat to read. I couldn't help noticing all the 5 star ratings here - well deserving of this fine author. Bravo!"},{"Title":"Lady's Maid - A Novel Of The Nineteenth Century","review":"Lady's Maid is the fictional life story of Lily Wilson, Elizabeth Barrett Browning's maid. Since all I knew about either of the Browning poets before starting this book was the little bit I remember from high school English, I wasn't sure if this was the book for me; fortunately, it really is the story of Wilson (as she is called throughout the book), and background knowledge about her employers is not essential. In fact, being famous poets, I expected to see them romanticized, but they're not; this is an unflinching tale of the conditions of 19th century servitude, including low wages and the impossibility of starting a family while retaining work as a maid. Parts of the book are likely to leave the reader angry with the Brownings, which may be disappointing for fans of their work.The book is narrated in the 3rd person and almost entirely from Wilson's perspective, but peppered with letters she writes to friends and family, long enough that at times it feels as if the book is jumping back and forth between 1st and 3rd person. The beginning positively drags, but the pace picks up slightly as the book goes on and Wilson travels with the Brownings and courts several different men. I found this to be an engaging book and well worth reading if you're interested in seeing life from the servant's perspective; somehow all those books where the main characters are served fail to portray the difficulty a servant faces if she dares to want a life of her own. And Lady's Maid is also an interesting study in co-dependency in its portrayal of Wilson's relationship with her mistress. At 550 pages, the book at times feels overlong, although I understand the difficulty in trying to cover 17 years of a woman's life while including enough concrete scenes that we still feel connected to her.Overall, I would recommend this book if you have the patience to see it through and still think it worth your time. If nothing else, it's an honest look at relationships that transcends any specific time period."},{"Title":"Lady's Maid - A Novel Of The Nineteenth Century","review":"This book was engrossing although I did not understand the obsessive love the maid, Elizabeth (Lily) Wilson, had for Elizabeth Barrett Browning. The way the relationship was laid out in the book between Wilson and Barrett Browning did not merit the reciprocation of love that Wilson gave to her employer. Perhaps that is the impetus that spurred the author to write the book, i.e., the strangeness of the obsessive love Wilson had for Barrett Browning. It certainly gives one much to ponder at the end of the book, such as how much about Wilson's character is true and how much fiction. There is also much to ponder about other relationships in Wilson's life and her treatment of them but I don't want to give anything away so I won't mention them.I also felt the book was, in some places, too long. The author went on a bit too much when she could have shortened an episode of storytelling; especially toward the end. I wanted her to get to the ultimate point but she went on and on for pages with inconsequential day to day trivia before she finally did. Was she just trying to keep me purposely in suspense? I don't mind some suspense, in fact it is welcome but too much becomes tedious.Overall I enjoyed the book and would recommend it."},{"Title":"Lady's Maid - A Novel Of The Nineteenth Century","review":"Forster does a good job of pulling us into the plight of Wilson, the maid. She effectively demonstrates the selfishness of employers and the desperation of servants in that era. The book is long and sometimes slow and seems to repeat itself in certain points, and I wish Wilson had come to her realization of self-sufficiency earlier on, but overall I liked it and wanted to see how it ended, however sad."},{"Title":"Lady's Maid - A Novel Of The Nineteenth Century","review":"Told from the intriguing perspective of Elizabeth Barrett Browning's maid, Wilson, this book asks us to look at the relationship between the English upper-class and their personal servants in the nineteenth century. Where close bonds can develop, as they do here, what are the obligations of a maid to her mistress, and what are the obligations of a mistress to her maid?Here, the Brownings (especially Elizabeth) do not necessarily come off well, at some points seeming to deliberately throw up obstacles to the happiness of Mrs. Browning's maid, even though to help her would come at little or no cost to themselves, and would seem to be no more than she deserves after years of loyal and devoted service. But Wilson also makes poor choices; is she relying on the Brownings for their help inappropriately? That she continually chooses her employers over herself and her family is frustrating, as is the Browning's continuing inability to recognize the sacrifices she makes.The resolution of the book is not entirely satisfactory. After a lengthy, drawn-out process, Wilson more or less accepts that she is on her own and that the Brownings owe her nothing. But it feels more as though she was forced to this realization, rather than coming to it naturally, and showing some growth as a character."},{"Title":"Lady's Maid - A Novel Of The Nineteenth Century","review":"I have to start out by saying that it has been 9 years since I read this book, but even now it stands out as one of the most telling books I have ever read about a genious writer named Elizabeth Barret Browning. In Lady's maid the story of Elizabeth Barret Browning is told from the eyes of her Maid servant. This unusual perspective gives the reader the ability to see the writer(Elizabeth Barret) from a third party focus instead of a introspective focus. The book is sooo good that you are instantly transfixed after the first page. If you are wise you will buy the book and read it when you can literaly sit down and read it cover to cover and enjoy it. It is that good! Enjoy and be edducated.

This novel illustrates in graffic term, the life conditions of a servant in the mid-1800's England. Since \\"history is written by the victor\\", we receive a plethora of historical information of the rich and powerful as well as the desperately poor and victimized. Often the lifestyles of the regular and un-famous are unknown to us. \\"Wilson\\", maid for 16 years to one of the most famous female poets ever, was a regular average person for her day. This novel explores the deepest thoughts feeling and trials of a woman in the working class of pre-industrialized Europe. It thoroughly explores the relationship that the working class had with their upper-class overlords. The novel is not a happy story as Wilson is not the master of her own destiny. She loves her mistress, Miss Elizabeth, almost to the point of bondage. Wilson's loyalty is far greater to her msitress than her mistress is to her. As a result, Wilson experiences great losses personally while staying tied in one way or another to the Brownings. In many ways this novel made me angry at the upperclass inhumane treatment of their servants as well as angry at Wilson for not standing up for herself more firmly. Yet I was also granted a glimpse into the terrible life choices forced on Wilson due to her financial and social status. I thank goodness that these societal distinctions are a thing of the past. Like all novels set in the mid 19th century, Lady's Maid grants the reader an entertaining and sorrowful perspective of how lack of freedom of choice for the majority of women determined their lives for them."},{"Title":"Lady's Maid - A Novel Of The Nineteenth Century","review":"I rather enjoyed the first half of this book, where it was focused partly on Elizabeth Barrett as a recluse.

Or even believing that she deserves a life of her own. She's mostly content (whatever her whining) to bask in vicariously living through what crumbs her employer throws her. I lost patience with her very quickly. What little she learns is mostly too little and too late. As for those who say \\"this is how life was for maids -- sure, for some.

Try the Banner of Truth Edition."},{"Title":"Rare Jewel of Christian Contentment","review":"This is 'the book' on the doctrine of Christian contentment. The depth of the Puritans is rarely even approached by modern authors. Burrough's takes you through some of the ABC's of Christian living. For example on p.87-88 &quot;We deserve nothing and therefore why should we be impatient if we do not get what we desire.&quot; Perhaps at the root of discontentment is that we really do not desire God's will in everything, at least in some things we want the Lord to rubber stamp and implement our will even if it is contrary to His. A Christian can be content no matter what their circumstances because contentment comes from the inward state of the heart and not from outward circumstances as the author ably instructs the reader. The importance of a believer learning to be content(and it is a lifelong process)would be difficult to overstate. It helps in dealing with temptation, it prepares the Christian for any type of service their Lord and Master requires of them, and it brings great comfort no matter how bleak things may appear to be. The writer also enables the reader to understand how that comfort is brought, on p.130 &quot; Certainly our contentment does not consist in getting the thing we desire, but in God's fashioning our spirits to our conditions.&quot; God works in us to view things by faith, and by doing so , we see things more and more filtered through God's perspective. By doing that we can see a little more of the big picture of all of the Lord's dealings with His people and bring that to bear on what is happening in our life. Any Christian who learns to be more content both glorifies God and becomes increasingly useful in His service and thats why this book is so important and useful for the Lord's people."},{"Title":"Rare Jewel of Christian Contentment","review":"Look at the self-help secion and Christian Living section in bookstores and you will find hundreds if not thousands of books professing to help the reader to contentment and happiness. Very few, if any, survive the test of time much less the test of human experience.This great book, written almost 400 years ago, addresses the basic problem of human discontent, suffering and offers a timeless and tested solution. 16th and 17th century Divines did not mince words, cater to the fickle tastes of the reading public or care about being poitically correct.

But there is certainly much more to learn from the text, which I consider the best exposition on Phil 4:11. Burrough's coverage seems to be more comprehensive than that of Watson's who also wrote a treatise on the same subject 'The Art of Divine Contentment' 5 years after Burrough did. What I particularly enjoy is the lessons on the mystery of contentment, the excellence of contenment, how Christ teaches contentment, the evil and aggravation of a murmuring spirit, and how to be content. I found some examples used to clarify certain points are both humbling and humorous, whether they were intended to be so or not, some of which are given ch.7 that talks about one of the excellencies of a contented spirit being the soul is fitted to receive mercy and to do service. \\"No man or woman in the world is as fit to receive the grace of God, and to do the work of God, as those who have contented spirits. So if we would be vessels to receive God's mercy, and would have the Lord pour his mercy into us, we must have quiet, still hearts. We must not have hearts hurrying up and down in trouble, discontent and vexing, but still and quiet hearts, if we receive mercy from the Lord.\\" Then two illustrations were presented which I thought are hilarious. \\"If a child throws and kicks up and down for a thing, you do not give it him when he cries so, but first you will have the child quiet. Even though, perhaps, you intend him to have what he cries for, you will not give it him till he is quiet, and comes, and stands still before you, and is contented without it, and then you will give it him.\\" The second illustration is not only hilarious, but also humbling because it reminds me that I am indeed a beggar knocking on God's door for mercy every day. \\"If a beggar knocks once or twice at the door and you do not come, and thereupon he is vexed and troubled and thinks it much that you let him stand a little while without anything, you think that this beggar is not fit to receive an alms. But if you hear two or three beggars at your door, and out of your window you hear them say, 'Let us be content to stay, perhaps they are busy, it is right that we should stay, it is well if we get anything in the end, we deserve nothing at all, and therefore we may well wait a while', you would then quickly send them an alms.\\" The chapter that deals with how to obtain contentment is full of precious practical, profound exhortations. But I decide to restrain from revealing more than what I pointed out at the beginning of this review, that is, to labor to get a good interpretation of God's dealings in our life, so I won't spoil the enjoyment of those who read this review and decide to buy and read the text. If you are looking to enjoy God and his Word through God-centered, God-exalting expository texts, even on a Scripture verse as simple as Phil 4:11, this is one of them."},{"Title":"Rare Jewel of Christian Contentment","review":"I'm a prolific reader, and have read a fair number of Christian books dealing with a variety of subjects.

I was frustrated and annoyed with where I was, the job I had, and a million other things. God used Burroughs' powerful book to be the single greatest influence in helping me to work through that.Burroughs shows how our desires are a sphere, like the earth's atmosphere. Our possessions (who we are, what we have, our station in life) are a smaller sphere within the first. To attain contentment, we must understand God in such a way as to shrink our desires to match our possessions, because we understand that God knows that what we have is exactly what we need. This continual shrinking of desires helps us to love and enjoy all the wonderous things God has given us. The further we go on this path, the smaller our sphere of desires becomes, until eventually we realize that we deserve nothing we have, and can only praise God with gratefulness for all he has given.Read this book when you are hurt.

This is the subject and the work of Jeremiah Burroughs in his classic text, The Rare Jewel of Christian Contentment. Originally published in 1648, Contentment later underwent some language modernization and was most recently republished by Banner of Truth as a part of their Puritan Paperbacks series.I finished the text today and have some mixed feelings regarding Burroughs' thoughts on the topic. Burroughs' text focuses on attempting to unpack Paul's words to the Philippians. What does it mean to be \\"content\\"? How can that be achieved? What are the implications upon a content person's life? What if we're not content? Burroughs answers all of these questions quite clearly--sometimes too clearly. Unfortunately, at times his answers, well, just aren't really satisfactory considering the evidence.Burroughs begins by defining contentment. After reading the first chapter (slowly), there was still a bit of ambiguity concerning what exactly it means for a person to be \\"content\\". I ended up attempting to draw conclusions of Burroughs' definition from the coming context of the book. Unfortunately, it still wasn't especially clear. It seems after finishing the book that Burroughs' means to say that contentment is a sense of being okay with, satisfied in, not needing more than, whatever physical circumstance we may find ourselves in. This seems to be a relatively obvious interpretation of Paul's words to the Philippians, however, Burroughs doesn't always sound like that's what he means when talking about contentment. Perhaps its generational.Burroughs flows through a kind of rocky path of exploration. He begins with a definition of contentment, flows into how mysterious and miraculous a thing it is (although, doesn't seem to designate it as something Christians can exclusively enjoy), then moves into the modes of teaching Christ employs when instructing his people. Following that, he goes on to explain the \`excellence' of being content. Up until this point, I tracked quite well and often added audible \\"hmm\\" noises to my reading. Following his bit on contentment's excellence, he moves into the sin of not being content, or as he puts it, the sin of a \`murmuring' spirit. It's at this point that things began to swing a bit out of balance--at least in terms of the whole of scripture.Burroughs makes the point well that contentment is a duty. We ought to fight for it, seek it, labor to attain it. It is also convincing that to be discontented is sinful and we should not be okay with that kind of ingratitude. Unfortunately though, Burroughs' bit on sin, unlike many of his contemporaries, seems never to really call back to the work of Christ on the cross. Frankly, I was a bit astonished. He had a great deal to say about God's wrath and his wrath poured out on the discontented, worldly heart. But strikingly little to say about the great ocean of wrath poured out on the dying Jesus on behalf of his bride, who would undoubtedly struggle to achieve contentment all her days.His definition of \`murmuring' is also a bit unclear. At times it seems that he means some deeper heart condition that is out of rest and ungrateful toward God. However, at other times, it seems that his definition might mean something more like complaining. At times of the latter, it's hard not to call to memory David's psalms, which are flooded with complaints.When finally emerging from those chapters on the evils of discontent, Burroughs' returns to more useful discourse. Namely a conversation about how people regularly will excuse themselves from guilt in discontentment, followed by a clear and practical discussion of how to achieve contentment.Much of Burroughs' text was convicting and inspiring. Some of it was discouraging and frankly, out of balance. However, while I disagree with a good chunk of his thoughts, even in the midst of questionable things, there are to be found nuggets of really good insights. I think unlike some of the other books in the Puritan Paperbacks collection, this one may be written more directly to its specific time period. Not that contentment isn't ageless duty, but rather his method and tone may not be suited well for all time periods.Because of my own reservations, I don't recommend this book unless your up for the challenge of discerning and scrutinizing the text. If that is something you're up for, there's some excellent insight to be gained here. If you're not up for that, may I recommend anything written by John Piper; God willing, the intended effect will be much the same."},{"Title":"Rare Jewel of Christian Contentment","review":"This book was life changing for me.

The island is without a doubt the most breathtakingly beautiful place I've ever been. I went on a Windjammer Barefoot cruise around the Caribbean last summer. St. Bart's was the second island where our ship stopped. I was having dinner with some new friends that night, and believe it or not, we had the good fortune to miss the &quot;launch&quot; back to the ship from the island.Yes, we were pretty freaked out at first, but then we checked into a great hotel with an incredible view of the Gustavia harbor. To my delight, in this book is a picture of the harbor that must have been taken from somewhere near that hotel, because it's almost the same picture I took from the terrace of our suite. The hotel was called the Carl Gustaf, and it was REALLY expensive but I thought worth it!The next day, we chartered a flight from St. Bart's to Nevis and caught up with our ship. This book also has some great aerial shots of the island, which remind me of that flight.If you've been to St. Bart's and loved it, you'll love this book!"},{"Title":"St. Barth: French West Indies (A concepts book)","review":"In 1999, we were trying to decide the destination of our first Carribean trip. Some friends had suggested St. Barth... I bought it, it arrived two days later. 30 seconds into the book, I called my wife and said \\"we ARE going to St. Barth.\\" We did and spent two weeks. St. Barth looks EXACTLY as pictured in the book. Plus, the photos capture a sense of the spirit of St. Barth's, which is hard to put into words but great to experience. Now, for us, the book serves as a high quality photo album of one of the greatest places on this planet I've been to. Buy the book; go to St. Barth. Go back again (I hope soon)"},{"Title":"St. Barth: French West Indies (A concepts book)","review":"We had just returned from 2 weeks of sailing to various islands in the French West Indies and wanted to see more of St Bart's. This is the perfect book. The photos are beautiful and really portray the warmth and beauty of this lovely little island. We were looking for the answer to the the question of would we want to spend a few weeks there and the book lead us to conclude with a resounding yes. Any guests who see it on our coffee table cannot resisit."},{"Title":"St. Barth: French West Indies (A concepts book)","review":"This is a gem pf a book providing superb photos of this stunning island.

For those pondering a trip to St. Barths, this book will certainly help persuade you to jump on the next plane."},{"Title":"St. Barth: French West Indies (A concepts book)","review":"What a relief to have this book! I will not have to take any more pictures on my vacations to St. Barths. The photography captures the charm and beauty of St. Barths. The text taught me much I had never known about the island. The book has been a real joy to have when can't be on the island."},{"Title":"St. Barth: French West Indies (A concepts book)","review":"Mr. and Mrs. Didcott do a superlative job in their words and pictures of capturing the unique spirit of a unique place.

Love the island: love the book."},{"Title":"St. Barth: French West Indies (A concepts book)","review":"I wrote the first review about this book and I would like to add some lines:My girlfriend, who spent some of her holidays in St Barth had a look at the book and in her opinion it is not as good as other travelbooks about the Caribbean, but it is the best book about St. Barth she knows.Please add this comment to my review."},{"Title":"Mapping Biology Knowledge (Science & Technology Education Library Volume 11) (Contemporary Trends and Issues in Science Education)","review":"This is a really wonderful book. I bought this book strictly because I was fascinated by the work of one of the authors, Dr James Wandersee, even though biology is not my cup of tea. By chance, I \\"strayed\\" into his web-site, aptly called The 15 Degree Laboratory, while surfing the internet one day. (If you are curious to find out more, go to his web-site.) When I learnt, also by chance, that he had co-authored a book, I ordered it immediately from Amazon.com. Wow! What a great book!As a strategic explorer of knowledge and a very active practitioner in visual tools, I am always looking for other and better ways (or learning tools to be more precise) to build understanding, simplify complexity, map ideas and construct knowledge.Out of the book's table of contents, the following chapters (out of ten) attracted me the most at first glance:Chapter 1: overview of knowledge mapping; Chapter 5: meaningful and mindful learning; Chapter 7: using concept !circle diagramming as a knowledge mapping tool; Chapter 8: using concept mapping as a knowledge mapping tool; (the rest pertains to biology stuff)and I must say, I have learnt a lot from the authors.The above first two chapters give an excellent foundation to the book, and also examine the issue of meaning-making and meaning-building (the starting point of learning and understanding anything) from multiple perspectives. Kudos to the authors!The authors have very masterfully spin together an excellent exposition on knowledge mapping, with the proposition and application of two powerful visual tools, among many others in the book. I have deliberately picked these two tools because of my own personal and professional interests.One is concept circle diagramming, which to me is a terrific enhancement of the innocuous Venn Diagram (or its predecessor, the Euler Circle, if you are familiar with mathematics).The other is concept mapping, origi!nally made famous by Dr Joseph Novak, who wrote two excellent books on it - 'Learning How to Learn' and 'Learning, Creating & Using Knowledge.'Surprisingly, as academics, the authors write pretty well - crisp, succinct, and most of all, not boring.Although the authors have expounded them in the context of biology i.e. in the educational setting, I personally feel that the visual tools as propounded are very relevant to the corporate world. This is because, in understanding and simplifying complexity in a knowledge-based economy, the visual tools can serve as a powerful support system for the mind, create an arena in which we can make our knowledge explicit, reflect on its organisation and polish its edges. They are also useful for building and assessing our content and cognitive skills.I wish I have learnt these tools while I was in school or college. Learning would have been fun! And, life through the years would have been easier.For some reade!rs who think mind-mapping as created by Tony Buzan is great stuff, wait till you read this book and use the tools. If you are already familiar with mind-mapping, I would strongly recommend you to learn these visual tools, as a valuable supplement of your skill repertoire.It is my fervent hope that the authors of this book would sit down one day to re-write the book for the corporate world. - without the biology stuff, of course. That would be really great!!!"},{"Title":"Mapping Biology Knowledge (Science & Technology Education Library Volume 11) (Contemporary Trends and Issues in Science Education)","review":"Kathleen Fisher, Jim Wandersee and David Moody have put together a very important contribution to our knowledge about knowledge in biology. Their book summarizes some of the most significant work of the past 25 years in science education and cognitive science; work that promises substantial improvement in science teaching and learning at all levels, K-16.Mapping Biology Knowledge, as the name suggests, focuses on the use of graphic organizers and metacognitive tools. The book combines theory, research and practical advice for teachers, curriculum designers, and others who have a commitment to reform in science education. In so doing, the authors direct our attention toward the most important theme of the reform effort....the need to encourage meaningful learning and conceptual understanding.Among the tools and techniques they recommend are: SemNet software, concept maps and concept circles. The authors provide step-by-step directions for implementing these tools in classrooms, multiple examples of ways they can be useful, and insightful suggestions for teachers, students and others.For those interested in research on cognition and learning in biology, this book provides some of the essential &quot;tools of the trade.&quot; Graduate students and faculty who are looking for advice will find some of the wisest, most thoughtful and generative ideas anywhere. I recommend this book heartily!"},{"Title":"Limits to Ambition","review":"This novel is brilliant. I don't care what anyone else has to say, it is thought provoking and amazingly written. I am proud to be in the film version that is currently being made."},{"Title":"Limits to Ambition","review":"Limits is a book that I can say I would read again.

The characters were believable and true to life.

It is one of those books that you just can't put down.Reiner writes of a man and his path to love. What that love is is up to the reader. You take away from this story what you read into it. It can be as simple as ABC, or as complex as E=MC2.The author captures the reality of a man coming to terms with LIFE."},{"Title":"Limits to Ambition","review":"I am frustrated with this book. The characters are there. The plot is there. But the book just fails to deliver. The writer fails to build up on the characters. A pity because the three main characters tangled in a love triangle could have been developed so much better. The writer also places too much emphasis on the killer. The writer is too ambitious as he wishes to convey too much in a 120 pages book. And the result is a somewhat \\"flat\\" story with much to be desired."},{"Title":"Little Men: Life at Plumfield With Jo's Boy","review":"The magic of youth is captured here in all its transitory and fleeting beauty and turmoil. An idyllic home in the country side is the setting for this classic that you have to read if you're between the ages of 8 and 14."},{"Title":"Little Men: Life at Plumfield With Jo's Boy","review":"When a self-assured young tomboy grows up in a male-dominated society during the 1800s, she then makes up for it by becoming a cheery but eccentric &quot;Mother Goose&quot; running a broading school for young male heirs. There are many really wonderful sequences in this story, though it doesn't really have much of a plotline. In fact, there are even some very creative and uncannily modern methods of parenting to drill the boys (yes, there are a few girls present, too) into well-meaning gentlemen one day. A do-gooder's fantasy that really gushes with sappy maternal cooing and fussing at times, but overall it's a very remarkable book ever written by a proper lady of the Victorian era."},{"Title":"Little Men: Life at Plumfield With Jo's Boy","review":"Little Men is the funniest of all the three books. I like this book, but not as much as the Jo's Boys or Little Women. Little Men begins with 'Nat as the 1st ch. If you have seen the movie and think it is great, wait till you read the book. The novel is much more sophisticated and very touching. The movie basically concentrates on Nat and Dan, but the novel is about every single boy and girl. If you've seen the movie and didnt like it, guess what, try the novel! My fav't characters are everybody. Old Chirper(Nat), Dan, Demi, Daisy, Tommy, Franz, Commodore(Emil), Nan, Princess(Bess), little Ted, Rob, Jack..too many people. If you like the story of boys and girls, this is one of the books to read. If this is the Alcott's 1st book you've read, TRY ALL! ALCOTT IS THE BEST! My fav't part is the LITTLE COOKSTOVE(iron). Its so neat, and how Daisy, Nat, Demi, Dan, Emil, Tommy, and dont forget our Teddy, and Rob, standing up for each others."},{"Title":"Little Men: Life at Plumfield With Jo's Boy","review":"This book is a follow up on the wonderful book (that I love) Little women. Little women was a enchanting book about the March girls and a friendly neighbor named Laurie. Jo March gets married to Mr. Bhaer and in Little Women and now they have a place called Plumfield, which they inheirited. With Plumfield they make it sort of like an orphanage and takes boys from the street, teaching them and loving them. I would recommend this book, if you read the first one.

This novel is simple with its man against himself conflict, yet sweet, and a reminder of the trials and tribulations of growing up. You have no choice but to feel compassion for the boys and girls of Jo's house, and the innocent that they maintain throughout the book. After having read three books by the above authour, I am eagerly about to devour another as Alcott continually supplies the reader with innovative, and intriguing emotions, faces, and experiences."},{"Title":"Little Men: Life at Plumfield With Jo's Boy","review":"Mostly I got this book because I never owned it and do own Little Women and Jo's Boys.I want my daughter to have the trilogy.I thought it was terrible.A mere series of goody-goody character sketches with very little holding it all together. If anything, it just underscored how Jo should have accepted Teddy! They were a great pair.I did not care about these boys much and even had trouble distinguishing them from one another.Jo's Boys was much better--at least a novel, so read Little Men only to fill in the blanks."},{"Title":"Little Men: Life at Plumfield With Jo's Boy","review":"Though I read Little Women many times as a girl and just again recently, I hadn't ever read Little Men. I recnetly purchased the book so I could find out what happens to the March family. The story begins slowly (even for 19th century literature) and I found myself wondering if Louisa May Alcott actually wrote it-the style seemed so different. However, as I became more involved in the book Alcott's old charm comes through. I enjoyed a thouroughly delightful tale. Little Men continues with the story of Plumfield and introduces all of Jo's boys. It is a must read for any Alcott fan!!"},{"Title":"Little Men: Life at Plumfield With Jo's Boy","review":"I loved Little Women and this book just confirms what a wonderful writer she was. Lots of hidden truths and wisdoms."},{"Title":"Little Men: Life at Plumfield With Jo's Boy","review":"The power of Louisa May Alcott's twisting, turning, diving and jumping plot comes from her use of vivid detail and her understanding of what really makes a good story. Her characters carry a reality with them that makes each scene come alive.

I had to read it for a class project and this book was a snooze. Now I know everyone who did enjoy this book is probably wanting to rip my eyeballs out of my head, but I wanted to give my opinion. I hated this book so much I never wanted to reopen it, I couldn't help put it down. It took me weeks to read this book when it usually only takes me 2 days to read a book.

Recommend to anyone who loves a good read."},{"Title":"Little Men: Life at Plumfield With Jo's Boy","review":"It is truly a shame that the highest number of stars you can rate a book is five, because I would give this book a million stars if I could.It is truly one of the two best books I have ever read. (The other off course is Little Women).Little men is a book that can make you both laugh and cry. The morals inside are more useful than any of the ten commandments. Louisa May Alcott has definetly done it again.Without giving away everything, these are some of the reasons why you will enjoy the book:1) You see Jo grow up. She is no longer the wild child who's impetuous and androgynous character often lead her to trouble. She inherits maternal qualities that you never expected Jo to have.2) You will get more insight on the professor. Although I truly wanted Teddy and Jo to get together, this book made me think otherwise. Professor Bhaer, with Jo's help, makes a delightful father to the boys. He is the one you will get most of the life morals from.3) The boys in Plumfield are definetly the key figures in the book. They create both the mischievious and melancholy stories. As I said, 'you'll laugh and cry'. Reading about these boys will make everyone reflect on their own lives.4) Teddy grows up too. If you enjoyed the young scandulous Teddy, you'll enjoy the new one even more. In little men, Teddy (like Jo) has grown into a real mature father.There are plenty more exciting things in the book. It is truly a classic masterpiece recommended to anyone who needs a lift in their spirit."},{"Title":"Little Men: Life at Plumfield With Jo's Boy","review":"While Little Men is not up to the literary achievement of Little Women, it is a wonderful tale for kids. It is JUST perfect for reading chapter by chapter to kids as part of an evening family night. It is as jolly as a house full of rambunctious boys could be.Jo Bhaer, nee March, has boys of her own now and boys to spare. She and the Professor take in students based on charity and kindness. Some boys are neglected, some are badly brought up, all need love, laughter and a caring environment. Plumfield is all that and more.The jolly goings-on make you wish you could have gone to school and lived at Plumfield. The book is prevented from being saccharine by the all-too-familiar themes of neglected kids, growing pains and the sad and much too early death of a favorite character from Little Women.There is lots of fun, and lots to discuss in this sequel to Alcott's marvelous Little Women. Lest you think boys won't like Alcott, I know more than one man who loves Little Women even as an adult."},{"Title":"Little Men: Life at Plumfield With Jo's Boy","review":"Little Men is (for those who do not know) a sequel to Little Women. Little Men is a wonderful and enticing book about the main character in the previous book, Jo. Jo and her husband are running a school for boys although there are few exceptions. Most of the book is a about their adventures, and Jo picks up many more people to live and learn at her school, for she is running a boarding school. The book will warm your heart right from the begining and you will read on not stopping even a moment. : )"},{"Title":"Little Men: Life at Plumfield With Jo's Boy","review":"Please note, this is and has always been, one of my favorite stories. I am not reviewing the story Little Men, but the way it was published by IndiePublish. I would give the story 5 stars, but this presentation only two.On the bright side, the cloth binding appears very well done and should last quite a while.Unfortunately, the publisher chose to reformat all the paragraphs in the text so that like this review all margins are left justified and a blank line separates the paragraphs. If it were done well, it might have worked ok, but it was done very clumsily with the completion of a sentence often being separated from the rest of the paragraph. (I have a suspicion that the reformatting of an original text was done by using a Find-Replace function of a word processor and not checked by an editor.) This makes for some awkward readings, and probably not something I would want to put into the hands of a child.Also the text was not proofed for typos or other simple errors in punctuation, and there are some places where I could not tell what the original sentence was intended to say. Again, I expect that the only proofing done on this version was by a spellchecker and a lot of simple mistakes entered into the publication.I wish to repeat, that I love this story and have since I was a boy, and would recommend the story to any child, but would not recomment this particular volume."},{"Title":"Little Men: Life at Plumfield With Jo's Boy","review":"I really loved this book!

Loosely plotted, it's a good bedtime book, because each chapter or couple of chapters presents a complete vignette. After all, you don't always want to be reading a book that keeps you up till all hours! Life at Plumfield is almost idyllic, with just enough conflict to keep things moving along. When I was a child, I longed for a museum like theirs, and a miniature cast-iron stove, and all kinds of things--the book was wonderful for my imagination.

It follows events in their lives as married women, and the lives of their children. This book seems to be more popular with boy readers than \\"Little Women\\", which often appeals to girls between the ages of 11-15 (depending on their individual reading level). Perhaps this is linked to the fact that there are more main characters who are boys in \\"Little Men\\". The innocent quality of romance and adventure in this plot, as well as the emphasis on morality and family relationships, make this a good gift for those concerned about the types of literature their children are reading. Adults buying this for children should note that the moral aspects of the story generally reinforce 19th century Protestant Christian values (its your choice whether that impacts your purchase or not!).This is another book that has continued to be my favorite 20 years after reading it for the first time."},{"Title":"Little Men: Life at Plumfield With Jo's Boy","review":"I really liked this book because it was really exciting and fun all at the same time!

The reason I liked the ending is because it was the end and I didn't have to read it anymore."},{"Title":"Little Men: Life at Plumfield With Jo's Boy","review":"I've been wanting to read this book for quite a while now. Let me say, that it was well worth the wait! Thank you for such a great deal on a really good book."},{"Title":"Little Men: Life at Plumfield With Jo's Boy","review":"If Little Men weren't an entertaining novel, it could serve as a timeless reminder of how adults can help children direct their energies in helpful ways and develop better habits. The philosophy is to provide lots of love, understanding, forgiveness, slack and carefully chosen incentives and guidance while encouraging friendships among youngsters who will balance one another out if they spend time together. You'll recognize lots of Marmee's loving approach in Jo's more rough and tumble perspective. It's a nice combination.For those who loved the child-centered world of Little Women, you'll be entranced by what Jo does to educate and raise her own boys, her nephew and niece, a troublesome neighbor girl, male boarders and some unfortunate orphans.Much of the novel focuses on the character development of two poor orphans, Nat and Dan, who find Jo's Plumfield (which she inherited near the end of Little Women) to be an unfamiliar paradise of a home and school that requires some adjusting to.Although the title is Little Men, there's plenty of focus on Daisy, twin sister to Demi, Nan, an independent girl with lots of energy, and Bess, Amy and Laurie's daughter. There are pretend balls, teas, and dramatic performances that echo those in Little Women.But the male slant that is subdued in Little Women bursts forth in Little Men as the book recounts pranks, brawls, collections of disgusting items, pillow fights, taming a colt and doing heavy chores.Like Little Women, the chapters are really short stories involving the same characters as they progress from month to month.If you haven't read Little Women, by all means start there. An important part of the fun of Little Men is finding out what happened next to Meg, Jo, Amy and Laurie."},{"Title":"Little Men: Life at Plumfield With Jo's Boy","review":"I have read Little Men a dozen times over and each time I either find something new...or just love the parts I already read! It is excellent, with great morals, and true-to-life characters."},{"Title":"Little Men: Life at Plumfield With Jo's Boy","review":"There is not that much to say about this brilliantly crafted book, for it is almost too good to describe. I decided to give this book four stars because in some cases she didn't write as enthusiaticly as in her other books. Don't get me wrong though, as a book, it deserves ten stars! As a Louisa May book, only four (out of five that is!) I cannot write to you, reader, too much about the sumery because every chapter was a new scrape or story. But don't worry, everything is connected. Jo March from Little Women now is married and has two boys of her own, plus a few orphans and sons of busy fathers. In Plumfield, boys are every where, including the musical Nat, book worm Demi Brooke, indestructable Tommy, Dan, adorable Teddy, and deticated Rob! But don't forget the three girls: timid Daisy Brooke, Giddy-Gaddy Nan, and the loveable Bess. All share scrapes and adventures that will leave you scandalized. Jo and her husband have a lot in store for them! Plus, a hint of romance at the end. Look for the sequal, Jo's Boys! So, reader, thank you for taking you time to read this review, and I honostly insist for you to read this book! Louisa May Alcott is one of my favorite authors, and maybe she can be yours too! Sincerly, A grateful reader."},{"Title":"Little Men: Life at Plumfield With Jo's Boy","review":"I loved Little Men ! I didn't care for Little Women, but Little Men is a book I hope to read to my kids. I read it after seeing the video. The book is a lot more detailed and interesting. I just think it is the greatest and can't wait to read Jo's Boys! P.S. I am not 1, but I don't want to share my age"},{"Title":"Little Men: Life at Plumfield With Jo's Boy","review":"I read Little Men; the sequel to the classic tale of Little Women. Louisa May Alcott, the author of Little Men, Little Women, Country Cousins, Eight Cousins or the Aunt Hill, and Jo's Boys was born and raised in Concord, Massachusetts, where she did all her writing. As she got older she suffered the loss of her two sisters, both at a young age. In her books she basis her characters on herself and on people she knew, including her three sisters, her mother, and her father. Overall, she had a happy life of writing, though she never got married. Little Men was first published in 1871 by the Nelson Doubleday, Inc. This book is about life at Plumfield; the school Jo Bhaer and her husband Fritz founded. Their school allows boys (and some select girls) from all locks of life into it. Because of this reason it has become well known by many people for its kindness to all. The Bhaers show great love to every child who comes through, including boys from the street, Jo's own nieces and nephews, and her own children. They treat each boy the same and give them their own jobs to do around the farm. In turn, each child learns responsibility, respect, patients, and love at Plumfield, unlike any other school.Plumfield has many residents, but only some are characters in this book Jo Bhaer was the hero in Little Women, who ends up marries the German professor, Fritz Bhaer. She is lively as ever caring for the boys and girls of Plumfield including her own sons Teddy and Rob. Mrs. Bhaer is a gentle, caring woman who loves each child as her own. In turn the boys and girls teach her that not all lessons are learned in the classroom, in fact some are learned and she doesn't even realize it. Fritz Bhaer is a kind German professor who has a very heavy accent. He teaches the children all the regular subjects like math, science, arithmetic, and history. Father Bhaer also teaches lessons on growing crops and cultivating them, taking care of animals, and helps each child on their mishaps. For all these reasons, the boys and girls love Father Bhaer, and help him in any way they can.Nathaniel (Nat) Blake, one of the boys taken off the street and given a second chance at Plumfield. In the beginning he is a weak and sickly boy who is sent to Plumfield by Mr. Laurie, a dear friend of Jo's. When he gets their he does not now how to read or write. Gradually, kindness and determination help Nat to get stronger, less sickly, become a great reader, and an unusually good writer.Tommy Bangs, one of the boys who goes to Plumfield. He is the biggest troublemaker there, but has a kind heart so everyone can't help but love him. Overtime, he becomes less troublesome, and helps out more than anyone expected. Daisy and Demi, Jo's sister's kids also go to Plumfiled. They are very kind to each other and to everyone else. Daisy loves to play with dolls and cook for the residents of the school. Demi is a very smart boy, who listened to every one of his grandfather's stories, as a small boy. He learned a lot of his knowledge from those stories. He does have a downfall though. He loves to read, but he reads action books when he should be reading and studying for school. Father Bhaer breaks this habit quite easily when he finds out.On the street Nat met many people, including a sluggish boy Dan who was nice to him. Dan ends up coming to the school also. He is not the best boy to make friends with, because he makes a lot of trouble. As the book goes on Dan gets cured from these bad ways by Father Bhaer and becomes a very nice, gentle boy. The second female resident of Plumfield is named Nan. She is nothing like Daisy or like most girls. Nan will take dares from anyone and do them, no matter how dangerous they may be! Daisy would love another girl who would play dolls and cook with her. By the end of the book, Daisy persuades Nan to play dolls with her. Nan agrees. After they play dolls Nan starts to be more girlish, but in the end she still does dangerous things.Little Men takes place in the late 1800s in Concord, Massachusetts. At this time slavery was still in the south. The children of Plumfield had all been sent there to board, for one reason or another. Nat and Dan were sent there because they were on the streets. Nan's mother had just died and her father couldn't afford to take proper care of her anymore. Tommy's parents did not want to deal with his pranks. Daisy and Demi wanted to go to the school where their aunt and uncle taught. A boy named Jack Ford was sent there because it was cheap, and there were other reasons for the boys that come later in the book.Little Men starts out when Mr. Laurie (one of Jo's old friends) sees Nat on the streets and sends him to Plumfield, the school run by Jo and Fritz Baher. When the door to Plumfield is answered by Asia the house maid, Nat can't help but stare at all the boys playing on the staircase, floor, and sliding down the banisters. One boy slides down the banister and lands hard on his rear. Nat rushes over to make sure he is all right. The boy says he's fine and introduces himself as Tommy Bangs. Then Mrs. Jo appears. She asks to see Nat by himself. They go into a side room and Mrs. Jo then tells Nat she will be happy to have him at their school.Nat rests the first day and night he is there. The next day is Monday, the first day of school. Fritz Bhaer teaches the boys at school and he treats Nat with special care since Nat can't read or write. Nat does fine his first day. He then knows that he must work hard to please his new family, and he will do it willingly in between chores and play. All the boys were taught but Daisy would not be permitted. As a result, she was not allowed to play football, or other games the boys played. Mrs. Jo felt sorry for the little girl, so, her and Mr. Laurie go and buy a whole kitchen set for her. She adores it, and will cook anything for anyone. The boys get jealous and eventually allow her to play with them, if she cooks special treats for them. Daisy agrees, and once again Plumfield was at peace.In the middle of the book, Nat's \\"dear friend\\" Dan comes for a visit. Nat pleads with Mrs. Bhaer that Dan can stay. She isn't quite sure she trusts Dan, but she agrees that he can stay. Dan ends up bringing trouble to the school by fighting the other boys, smoking tobacco, (which was strictly prohibited by the school), and setting the Plumfield on fire by not putting out his cigarette. Dan is sent to live with another boarding school for bad children like him. Meanwhile, since Dan was sent away, they have an extra bed to spare. Mrs. Jo meets a man in town whose wife has just died and doesn't want to take care of his daughter named Nan anymore. She comes to Plumfield and she fits right in with the boys better than Daisy. Daisy is heartbroken that there is finally another girl at the school, but doesn't want to play dolls and cook. She pleads and pleads with Nan and finally Nan plays with her. Nan finds out that dolls and cooking aren't that bad and she decides to do it with Daisy more often.Nan and Daisy were cooking one day and they had an idea to have a ball. They invited Nat, Tommy, and Demi. The boys agreed to come if there would be food, and of course there would be. The boys get to the ball and everyone starts dancing. Then they sit down to have tea and pastries. When they all sat down Daisy realized that the pastries were missing! Tommy had hidden them and would not tell where he had hidden them. Nan and Daisy became furious, and ran to get Mrs. Jo. When they told her what happened she did not punish the boys. Instead, she, and the girls would not talk to the boys until they said they were sorry. They finally apologized and the girls forgave them. The night after Mrs. Jo had just came back from town and saw a straw hat and a hand sticking out from a hay bale. She gently pushed the hay aside and saw that it was Dan! He had come back! She awoke him softly and he said, \\"Mother Bhaer, I have come home.\\" Those words touched her heart and carried him into Plumfield where he made a full recovery of his broken foot and tiredness.Towards the end of the book, the children of Plumfield go huckleberry picking. Mrs. Jo doesn't want five-year-old Rob to go but Nan pleads that she'll take care of him. Mrs. Jo gives in. All the children are picking berries peacefully, until Nan and Rob say they are going to a secret spot. They go into the woods and loose their way back. Nan starts to panic, for night is coming soon, and Rob starts to cry because he is scared. Thankfully, they are found before a bear found them. Little Bess, Jo's niece comes for a visit and is treated like a little princess by all the boys. There was some peace between them all. While she is there, they put on an end of school year play. This year it is Cinderella. All the children dress up like the characters in the book and put on a magnificent play. Everyone claps and awards flowers to Mrs. Jo. They finish off the book by having a gigantic feast.In the beginning of the book Father Bhaer tells each boy he is a crop that is growing in his garden. At the end of the year, if they are all good and whole Father did a good job furnishing them. As in all plants, the boys had weeds growing that tried to stop the way, and some of them did for a time. Nat told a lie, Jack stole Tommy's money, Tommy hid Daisy's pastries, and Demi read the wrong books at the wrong time. In the end, though there were some weeds, Father Bhaer had a very successful cultivation, and looked forward to new plants next year."},{"Title":"Little Men: Life at Plumfield With Jo's Boy","review":"Having read it as a child, I would have told you then that it was a good book, but having re-read it now, I'd say it's just &#34;okay&#34;. Reading it, I feel like I'm talking to a mother whose children can do no wrong, though they often do. Sometimes the style of it is annoying and at times the characters unrealistic, and I find myself longing for the more natural tone of Little Women. I honestly think the author had a much greater understanding of women then men, for how she wrote the boys. Even so, I do like the book and would recommend it to anyone who had read Little Women, but not as a standalone piece."},{"Title":"Little Men: Life at Plumfield With Jo's Boy","review":"This book is amazing.

I asked her to give me her opinion of the story and she told me that it was a wonderful story!

She would recommend it to anyone, and if I don't read it before hand that after I have children of my own she will give me the book and tell me to read it.She wished she had read it many years ago when I was younger because the examples of how to help little boys to become young men where amazing."},{"Title":"Little Men: Life at Plumfield With Jo's Boy","review":"Mention the name Louisa May Alcott, and most people will instantly think of \\"Little Women.\\" But in my mind, the less often discussed \\"Little Men\\" is just as great, if not better.The story picks up shortly after the conclusion of \\"Little Women,\\" with Jo and Frederick Bhaer running a school at Plumfield. Along with their own little Rob and Teddy, they are busy raising the neglected children of rich folks alongside the orphans they have taken in.While the boys exist in a virtual haven for good ol' fashioned fun upon the farmlike Plumfield, Mother and Father Bhaer still manage to teach them moral life lessons along with their classroom exercises.If you enjoy this book, be sure to pick up \\"Jo's Boys,\\" which takes place ten years after \\"Little Men\\" and concludes the boys' stories."},{"Title":"Little Men: Life at Plumfield With Jo's Boy","review":"I really enjoyed this book. i don't like to re-read books because i know what will happen, but i did re-read Little Men.

Little Men is a wonderful and enticing book about the main character in the previous book, Jo. Jo and her husband are running a school for boys although there are few exceptions. Most of the book is a about their adventures, and Jo picks up many more people to live and learn at her school, for she is running a boarding school.

However, there are twelve boys and two girls. The author takes you through six months of the year with the children. People will laugh at their antics and in the same token will be touched by the love and respect with which they treat each other. Each child has his or her obsticals to overcome and each has their own good points. The author makes you feel as if you are in the school with them the entire time. The reader will be drawn into their world and wish he or she were really there. This is an overall great book and I hope you will enjoy it as much as I did."},{"Title":"Little Men: Life at Plumfield With Jo's Boy","review":"Well, this book always will remain among my favorites, one that touches me and makes me feel. I think that when I was little, I saw a cartoon series about it. At that time, I didnt know that it was based on the novel by Louisa May Alcott. The success of this stories is the wide ranges of characters shown in this book, the spirit, moral conduct, inner strength, and most of all, the splash of fun and careless boyish pranks. THe setting is great, and I like to see how the old characters are developed, as well as the new. Strangely, my favorite character out of all the interesting ones was Dan, Jo's favorite firebrand. I liked how behind his rough nature and blazing dark eyes, and careless attitude, there is gentlenes, courage, and inner strength which Jo gradually brings out of him. And needless to say, Dan is a black sheep that Jo continues to cling on to. Yet, I liked the others as well, including rascal TOmmy, music loving Nat (especially how loyal Dan is to him), tomboy Nan, thoughtful Demi, little and big Teddy, (and Amy, who I am one of those rare people that wanted her to get with Laurie,) and adorable little Bess. All these heartwarming characters create a fire in the story which really warms me up. I've read Jo's Boys, and I like Little Men better because I can feel the spirit of things. Jo's Boys made me feel depressed. SO, this is a great book and surprizingly, the tone was very different from LIttle Women (which I liked greatly) and I just think that the firebrand is the most dashing character in it. He kind of reminds me of Laurie, except in a different, stronger way. Jo's Boys made me sad that all was to an end."},{"Title":"Little Men: Life at Plumfield With Jo's Boy","review":"This book is very heartwarming, and, at times, funny. The characters seem real, and Louisa May Alcott portrayed the girls, Nan and Daisy, very realistically-one a tomboy, one a \\"girl\\". They boys have funny jokes, and we feel Jo's pain after one boy, Dan, runs away. This is an excellent book...get it!"},{"Title":"Little Men: Life at Plumfield With Jo's Boy","review":"I read this book 14 years ago and I can still remember how I felt while I was reading it. It was a book that touched my life and changed it in a certain way.

This one is riddled with misspellings, confusingly incorrect pronouns and other typos. Every time there is an italicized passage of song or verse, the preceding paragraph is also italicized. It pains me to give such a wonderful piece of American literature such a bad rating, but I really wanted to warn people away from this copy."},{"Title":"Little Men: Life at Plumfield With Jo's Boy","review":"This sequel toLittle Women (Unabridged Classics)is a favorite classic, and second in the series that ends withJo's Boys. I read all of these books as a child, and the additional Alcott books as well.To satisfy a reading challenge, I have decided to reread some of these old favorites.Little Menwas delightful, highlighting the wonderfully compassionate nature of Jo and her husband, Professor Bhaer, whom she met in Little Women. At the end of that book, Jo's Great-aunt March, the cranky old woman who seemed too demanding at times has left her house (Plumfield) to Jo. Now Jo and Fritz (Professor Bhaer) have opened a school for boys. Most of the boys appear to be troubled or challenged in some way. The story tells us various antics and behaviors exhibited by the boys, and displays how Jo and Fritz deal with these issues.After reading the biographyLouisa May Alcott: The Woman Behind Little Women (John MacRae Books), I could see the parallels between LMA's father's ideals and their methods in dealing with the recalcitrant boys.The book was colorfully illustrated in the edition I reread, and was reminiscent of the book I read as a child.While I would always recommend any Alcott book, I must admit thatLittle Mendid not resonate with me the wayLittle Women (Unabridged Classics)did.

Although \\"print books\\" these days have many errors in proofreading, punctuation, spelling, etc., the Kindle versions of ALL of these books is DEPLORABLE.

In fact, for one who grew up reading, and loving it, i do not remember ever reading Little Men. So since it cost me nothing, i decided to download it and give it a try. I was transported back in time to a kinder, gentler, era where characters became family once again and stories became new and at the same time familiar.

Read it and you'll love it!"},{"Title":"Run Baby Run","review":"This book is a great read!With simple language that helps you get closer to the characters, and the inpiring goals that make you reflect in your own life!Truely one of the few books that could change your life for ever :)"},{"Title":"Run Baby Run","review":"There is something more powerful that what mortal man can comprehend in the story of Nicky Cruz: the Holy Spirit.

I have just recently finshed reading it (I only wished I had read it earlier)and wanted to know more so next best thing was to read David Wilkerson's book's (the little skinny preacher) that did wonders for Nicky.

Nicky's depiction of his journey from darkness to light was riveting. If his story doesn't touch you and you don't feel God's Spirit while reading it, then you need to pray and ask God to open the eyes of your understanding and to speak to you.For me, this was not merely abook purchase for me from Amazon,truly it was a good investment spiritually and I believe it will be for you as well."},{"Title":"Run Baby Run","review":"This book is so powerful. The story of David Wilkerson and Nicky Cruz is God breathed and inspiring. A must read!!!"},{"Title":"Run Baby Run","review":"This is the kind of book we need to give to our teenagers today. They can relate in the realest way possible. The pressures of peers, drugs, sex, the macho attitude, and lonliness. It tells of a boy and many others who just want someone to love them. It tells of how God uses other people to help these teenagers see that they are truly NOT alone. God loves them, no matter what crimes they've committed, or what kind of darkness is in their heads and hearts. Nicky Cruz shares his life with us in the most open way. He helps you see how his life was transformed from one of gang life to a wonderful life with a wife, children, and a mission to help other who were just like him. I highly recommend it. Even if you don't believe in God or His awesome power, you will still be able to relate to Nicky. I guarantee you'll be rooting for him and will feel joy in his life-changing moments. He is truly a man touched by God."},{"Title":"Run Baby Run","review":"This book starts with somebody yelling, \\"Stop that crazy kid!\\" I think right then and there was when my fears were ceased. I've really wanted to read \\"Run Baby Run\\" for quite sometime. Yet you run into somebody else's life story, and it isn't as interesting as you thought it might be. So, I did take a chance, and I'm glad I did. If you are looking for the power of Christ, you've come to the right place. If you are looking for the possible description of a street fight, you've come to the right place. If you want a little bit of romance added to the picture, (YEP) you've come to the right place! And the story is all true, that's the amazing thing. Mario Puzo didn't pen this out and send it out to his publisher. Nicky Cruz LIVED it, and he's here to tell his story. Some might be wondering if it's the same old \\"blood, sweat and tears\\" story. Hmm... maybe the words blood, sweat, tears, puke, convulsions, profanity, narcotics, spiritual warfare and MORE might fit the bill. Don't let that scare you away though.If you've ever heard Nicky Cruz speak, he isn't always the easiest to understand, yet his language of love through Christ is universal. He's ticked off at Satan, people! I believe he has every right to be. He tells an amazing story of coming from Puerto Rico to the States (New York) and almost immediately getting involved in gang activity. He talks of the Mau Maus, and how he became the president eventually. He speaks of his best buddy, Israel. He talks about friends killed in gang warfare. He goes into detail about the rumbles. But that's just the beginning. He also talks of a man named David Wilkerson. He talks of Pastor Wilkerson with much awe and reverence. And from there he talks of a great relationship with Jesus Christ. He goes into detail about Bible college, he tells of his struggles. He tells of his ministry. Now some of you reading my review might be asking, \\"Uh, Wolfe... did you just TELL us the whole story?\\" I don't think so. You'll have to get the book for that. The time invested in well worth it.There is power in the testimony of Nicky Cruz, yet there is more power in the one who saved him, Jesus Christ. Embrace the message of this book! If you are one who is still running, run to a Heavenly Father who is waiting. Then you'll run an awesome race! So don't let the title intimidate you. Pick it up, and don't run from what Nicky Cruz has to say."},{"Title":"Run Baby Run","review":"I read this book when I was a teenager (I'm almost fify now). Since I haven't reread it, I can't remember many of the details of the book. However, I do remember this book greatly impacted me in three ways. One, it showed why young people join a gang. Two, it showed how brutal gang life is. Three, it showed how Jesus can transform anyone, even a hardened gang member, if he or she will only ask Him to come into their heart. I believe everyone will benefit from reading Nicky's story."},{"Title":"Run Baby Run","review":"I read \\"Run Baby Run\\" when I was in my mid-teens, and the book had an incredible impact on me. Nicky's story of redemption from a life of sin and crime in the inner city of New York, and the story of the man who God used to bring Nicky to Christ, shows how the power of God is able to change any heart. It also gives the reader a glimpse into the life a young person lives in the inner city, surrounded by gangs, drugs, prostitution and poverty. The book is well written and impossible to put down! I came away with a new awe for the awesomeness of God and with a desire to reach out to those who are hurting, hopeless and in need of a Savior. I still read this book periodically to remind myself that there is a world that needs to hear the gospel and that nothing is impossible with God!"},{"Title":"Run Baby Run","review":"Nicky Cruz is a personal friend of mine, and I can assure you, he's the real deal -- open, honest, caring, a great husband, father, and grandfather. Ever since his dramatic conversion related in this book, he's been a changed man with a deep social conscious and a heart for inner cities and their residents. This book is a must read -- it never goes out of date. In fact, it is perhaps even more pertinent in today's culture than ever before."},{"Title":"Run Baby Run","review":"This is an inspiring and heart-breaking story.I am 50 yrs. now, and I read this novel when i was in my early 20s.I bought this book from a Christian Union Mission book store inRoseau, Dominica.

I would encourage all parents to purchase this book, with The Cross & the Switchblade by DavidWilkerson for their teenagers. There is also another hit \\"Coming Clean\\" that I am about to read for the first time. I have just ordered these books so I can read them again. NOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE WITH CHRIST.

On the first page I was hooked, and I couldn't put it down. This book combines heart-pounding suspense with the revelation of God's love for ALL of his children. It also shows how even a little man can go and do the impossible, like the pastor that saved Nicky Cruz. This is one of the best books i have ever read, and I do not say that lightly. I strongly recommend it for any christian."},{"Title":"Run Baby Run","review":"I have read this book years ago,when I myself was a teenager.After reading it,I was also lucky enough to see Nicky Cruz himself in person.I couldn't believe that a person his size could also have been one of the toughest sob's in the ghetto.I found his story very exciting and very moving.I am very anxious to find his book and read it again.I would also like to have my children read this book.It is a story that every family should have in their house and one that every family with teens should read."},{"Title":"Run Baby Run","review":"After reading Run, Baby Run a few years ago I wasvery relieved to find that I was not the only &quot;misfit&quot;Nicky's life was turned around in a very specialway.

But a preacher introduced Nicky to Jesus Christ one day and then everything changed..."},{"Title":"Run Baby Run","review":"First read some 25 years ago, this is an account of touching reality - a harsh environment of tortuously limited survival odds. That Cruz escapes is testament to the persistance of his religious preceptor. As compelling a message, however, is the strength Cruz found within to turn from his familiar and disturbingly comfortable existance. Therein lies the true purpose - it is less a bible thumping exercise than an exemplar of spiritual power. I have read the book on countless occasions and, though not deeply religious, have often drawn on it's dynamism. As with other critques, I believe that as a tale of hope, though it may not convert, it might at least reform."},{"Title":"Run Baby Run","review":"Although I haven't read this book by Nicky Cruz, I thought I'd just add my own \\"2 cents\\". This is just a bit of trivia about the author. This is the same Nicky Cruz who is mentioned in the book, The Cross and The Switchblade. He was portrayed in the 1970's movie, of the same name, by a young Eric Estrada (TV's CHIPS)."},{"Title":"Run Baby Run","review":"I first read this book when I moved to New York 7 years ago. It really opened my eyes to a lot."},{"Title":"Run Baby Run","review":"Sent book fast, enjoyed, but 30 pages missing (made up for it by sending book later one day service free)"},{"Title":"Run Baby Run","review":"I have a VERY hard time believing that many parts of this \\"memoir\\" are true. I am sure he had a rough time and was from a rough neighborhood but the book is littered with Christian speak and rings really inauthentic and manipulative to say the least. Nicky Cruz would have us believe that a minister came in to the ghetto and brought the heads of every gang to their knees in prayer on the street after preaching for just a few minutes, then somehow gets EVERY gang memeber in Brooklyn to attend a tent revival. Where are the people from The Smoking Gun, It smells like some major embellishing to me. Not to mention the writing style is dated and pretty sophomoric. There are alot of typos and grammatical errors and it pretty much feels like it's been written by someone who writes for The Watch Tower magazine.Hey I'm all for a good redemption story but this one just feels like propaganda, if you want to read a good gang redemption story, read a book called Monster."},{"Title":"Run Baby Run","review":"There was a lot of opportunity by the authors of this book- Nicky Cruz and his partner- to reach out and touch some of the thousands of troubled gang members in this country. Indeed, the chance was there for Cruz to show these lost kids what God's love is truly all about and how they can find salvation through acceptance. But instead, Cruz- apparently under the influence of Pentecostal Brainwashing- goes in a tirade of nonsense such as speaking in tongues (purely theater) and a host of holier than thou condemnation tactics- and in the process loses many kids that would have otherwise been found. I don't fault Cruz for his ministries, he is trying in his own way- but if he would leave the snake handling alone, he would reach a lot more lost souls."},{"Title":"Run Baby Run","review":"I read this book about 15yrs ago it had a great impact on my life. Nicky Cruz has a great testimony . I recently purchsed this book for my nephew .

It immediately catches your attention and the content keeps it. This book does an amazing job of showing how a person can go from living in a pit of \\"hell\\" to the point where their only view is that of heaven. The most amazing part of the book is how alive the Holy Spirit was in Nicki's life. Great book to read when you need to be inspired in God."},{"Title":"Run Baby Run","review":"Truly, I'm not into books AT ALL. My cousin borrowed me this book and it took me about 3 months before I even opened it(busy life). I thought maybe I'd read 3 chapters and give it back since I already had it for longer than expected. But, the book is truly captivating from beginning to end! Once I started, I couldn't put the book down. The fact that it is a REAL testimony and not a fictional story gives it more props!It's easier to pass judgment on street teens, gang-bangers, drug addicts when you're in the outside looking-in. But, the details in the book about what it's like living \\"The Street World\\" broadened my insight, giving me a WHOLE new perspective of troubled lives LONGING for a FRESH start, HOPING for a U-TURN in their lives, but seemingly TRAPPED in the error of their ways!When all else fails, and you find yourself TRAPPED behind the concrete walls of a messed-up life with NO DOORS to open and NO WINDOWS to break, your only way out is LOOKING UP to Jesus!

That is what Jesus does,he takes what was intended for bad and makes it good-If we let him! and Nicki Cruz Let him! Amen,Amen,Amen! MUST READ!"},{"Title":"Run Baby Run","review":"I read this book several times while still in school. I was lucky enough to see Nicky Cruz speak on a couple of occasions, and found his story fascinating. I found it exciting where it needed to be and uplifting as well. It is an amazing story and sheds light in a dark area. His story is from decades ago, but now more than ever, it is useful. Today's gang-obsessed youth could really use a book like this in their lives. Even without the religious themes within the book, the messages of hope and positive change are important."},{"Title":"Run Baby Run","review":"I was glued to this book from the very beginning.

Hopefully these errors have been corrected.A very powerfull book that needs serious editing."},{"Title":"Run Baby Run","review":"I was a young teenager when I first read this book. It has never left my mind. Now, I'm 45 years old and have children and very young grandchildren. I do not know that it will have the same affect on them that it had on me, but, since I home school my two youngest children (6 and 8) I will have them read it in a few years. I feel so much for Nicky Cruz. I always have. I felt sorrow, and pain, and hope. His story has helped me to realize that no matter how bad things seem for me, they could be so much worse.

I bought this as a gift to a mother who had difficulty holding hope and faith for her troubled son who was on drugs and living a life as such.

We see our great God in action helping our young people regardless of their circumstnces. I highly recommend Run, Baby Run."},{"Title":"Run Baby Run","review":"The first part of this book is sometimes scary and ugly to read, but so real you may not be able to put it down. Think you had a rough childhood?This book may lead you, like me, to count your blessings! The second half deals with Nicky's life after his dramatic conversion. It is the reason I did not give five stars. Mr. Cruz has mentioned elsewhere that he was not happy with the collaboration and \\"help\\" he got in \\"writing\\" this book. Sometimes, by no means not all of the time, after the time where Mr. Cruz is converted, some parts read like a Hollywood version of Christianity. Some words just don't seem to match the people who supposedly spoke them. Some of the conversions seem at least a little too fast, pat and formulaic. Overall though, I beleve the truth shines through. I really felt a great spiritual blessing in reading this book as if I were witnessing some of the true followers of the apostles in Acts. So moving. If you haven't seen The Cross and The Switchblade, where Eric Estrada plays the role of Mr. Cruz, by all means do so. Thousands have come to Messiah after watching it. It too seems to bring the presence of the Holy Spirit down upon one."},{"Title":"Run Baby Run","review":"When I was a middle school teacher in the 80s and 90s (I left teaching for another occupation), I used to read this text to my students the last 10 minutes of class (with my school principal's permission). My students were riveted to Nicky's story and begged each day for more time with the reading. Nicky's message is a powerful and positive one. I believe this story is still very relevant today. Some of the religion, although vital to the story, may need to be toned down for public school classrooms. I would edit the reading during the read-alouds but even doing this, the story remained compelling and transformative. I highly recommend the book and am pleased to see that its appearance has been updated and that Nicky Cruz's message continues to inspire young people today."},{"Title":"Run Baby Run","review":"A beautiful reminder that God is still capable of doing the impossible.There are no bounderies to his love and no limits to his power."},{"Title":"Run Baby Run","review":"i read this in highschool.

I went to church with other people when I was a child, because my parents didn't go yet, so, I have to credit this book with really being a witness to me.

For myself, I unhesitatingly give &quot;Awaken to Superconsciousness&quot; my unreserved recommendation. For these reasons:It's the least sectarian approach I've seen, thus it appeals to the widest section of readers. Unlike Tibetan, Zen, and Middle Eastern teachings, it isn't colored by centuries of priestly tradition. Yet it &quot;goes back to the source&quot;--and its very bedrock purity makes it &quot;user-friendly&quot; to Western sensibilities.It's very practical, because it's based on how our bodies are made. Paramhansa Yogananda said, &quot;At the inner end of the nervous system, the mind, interiorized, communes with the soul.&quot; This book teaches the art and science of patiently calming the breath and mind so that we can use our own nervous system to commune with the healing inner peace and joy. For my money, you won't find a better guide. (I've meditated for 30 years, and I learn something new from this book every time I open it.)"},{"Title":"Awaken To Superconsciousness","review":"I've been meditating and studying yoga for many years and thought I knew a lot until I read this book. This book grows on you--it's so full of practical ways to use meditation to improve your life, that you begin to take it for granted. If you want to know how to live like a master amidst the swirling vortices of life's ups and downs, this is the book that has the answers."},{"Title":"Awaken To Superconsciousness","review":"I have read quite a few books by the author and find his writing remarkable. He is able to take very complex topics and make them very easy to understand. So many authors want their writing to be complex so that others will think of them as deep thinkers or something. Mr. Walters works hard in his writing to make topics clear and easy to understand.You can tell that Mr. Walters writing is from his own experience on the spiritual path. To write this book, he is drawing from his own intutive understanding derived from 50 years of living a deeply spirutual life."},{"Title":"Awaken To Superconsciousness","review":"If you're a yogi, a meditator, agnostic, even an atheist- I think you'll be helped by this book. I was. Walters shares very simple meditation techniques that work. This approach has been tried and tested for thousands of years- it's all basic yoga meditation, presented in a way that Westerners can understand. If I could 'get it' from this book, then anyone can!"},{"Title":"Awaken To Superconsciousness","review":"I found this book Extremely helpful for learning meditation. It presents the principles of yoga meditation in an absolutely non-sectarian context. The ancient practice of meditation, in fact, is non-sectarian, as is so cleary portrayed in this book. The approach in the book is based on the Eightfold path of Patanjali- a non-sectarian approach if there ever was one.Walters supports his teaching with examples from different meditation paths, including (but not limited to) his own teacher, Yogananda. Meditation is presented cleary, simply, without dogma, and without any of the woo-woo new age stuff that's so common today. Yoga meditation is, after all, ancient rather than new.Even though Walters draws upon the ancient teachings of India, he presents meditation in a context that is easily approachable to modern people.His connection to the Ananda communities is clearly mentioned on the cover- the previous reviewer apparently is confused about this and other aspects of this excellent guide to meditation."},{"Title":"Awaken To Superconsciousness","review":"This book offers a thoughtful, creative, and practical approach to meditation as a practice and as a way of life. Obviously based on wisdom of a high order and drawn from a distant past, it is at the same time relevant, intelligent, well written, and even humorous. It is very inspiring and shows the writer, Walters, to be a person of sensitivity and realized wisdom."},{"Title":"Awaken To Superconsciousness","review":"Walters offers many helpful hints for meditators of all paths, novice or experienced. Even though he is the founder of Ananda (as clearly explained on the back cover), his approach is completely non-sectarian. I would highly recommend this book as an appropriate gift for a friend who meditates, or to give your own practice a boost."},{"Title":"Awaken To Superconsciousness","review":"I'm a long time meditator, and found many helpful tips and concepts in this book. There are practical pointers helpful for both beginning and advanced meditators. There are also several ideas that helped my meditation practice go to a deeper level.I would also highly recommend this book for beginning meditators. Each chapter has a meditation exercise that makes a fantastic addition to any meditation practice.I wouldn't hesitate to buy this book as a gift for a friend, whether a novice or advanced meditator, no matter what path they follow."},{"Title":"Awaken To Superconsciousness","review":"&quot;Superconsciousness&quot; is the term used for the metaphysical mechanism behind human intuition, spiritual and physical healing, successful problem solving, and the discovery of deep and lasting personal joy.

Donald Walters (founder of the Ananda communities based on the practice of yoga and the philosophy of the Indian sage, Paramhansa Yogananda) shares his many years of experience and expertise to show the reader how to use ancient yoga tradition to attain inner peace and provides the inquiring mind with inspiring meditative exercises, including chanting, affirmation and prayer.

There's a clear orientation here towardsgiving the deepest understanding of what meditation andsuperconsciousness are really all about, but also you come away having a solid handle on how to actually meditate and make it an integrated part of day-to-day life. You get the refreshing feeling from this book that spirituality isn't just a nice idea but a very real way to be more alive! This is definitely a &quot;keeper&quot;!P.S.,there's also a great companion tape available that has guided meditations."},{"Title":"Awaken To Superconsciousness","review":"As usual, Donald Walter's book is insightful, inspiring, and easy to read. I love his style of teaching and writing. I get so tired of the \\"pop spiritual\\" books being all flash and marketing and little on substance. Donald Walters walks his talk and has a depth of understanding about spirituality that is rare in the world."},{"Title":"Awaken To Superconsciousness","review":"Written by the founder of the Ananda Movement, this book is a good overview of Ananda teachings.However, the reader needs to keep in mind that this book is written from the perspective of Ananda teachings, and except for two brief references in the book, one in the author's bio in the back, this fact is somewhat obscured in the presentation.Specifically, this book is not always kind to other disciplines, such as Vipassana Meditation, characterizing Vipassana Meditation as prone to &quot;in many cases increase stress&quot; in busy people (see index in the book for Vipassana references).(I am a busy person and find Vipassana Meditation helpful to remain calm and alert and never find practicing Vipassana stressful).Overall, the book is a great introduction to mediation and spiritual technques from an Ananda point of view, and Mr. Walter's (a.k.a. Swami Kriyananda to his Ananda disciples) teachings and spiritual view. However, my main objection to the book is that it obscures its Ananda ties and Ananda viewpoint. Those looking to study meditation would be better served by knowing and being aware that this book is coming from the Ananda Movement's publisher, and take this into account when various meditation techniques and practices are discussed in Mr. Walters of Ananda's (Swami Kriyananda's) book. The fact that this book somewhat hides its Ananda roots and bias is my only problem with this book.Otherwise, it is a fine introduction to meditation and spiritual practice and deserves consideration with other books and other meditation teachings and spiritual practices for those on the spiritual path."},{"Title":"A retreat for priests","review":"excellent service and great book, easy reading, much to learn on the true priesthood and the holiness attained by reading great books like these."},{"Title":"The 2nd Scientific American Book of Mathematical Puzzles and Diversions","review":"Martin Gardner comes through again with a great book of puzzles.

However, I can honestly say that this is one of the most disappointing purchases that I've made in regards to pharmaceutical selling. Two primary distractions included the abundance of type-o's throughout the book and the fact that the authors couldn't decide on who their audience was when they wrote the book. Some of the material is directed at reps, some toward trainers and some toward pharmaceutical marketing executives. The sections of the book that focused on \\"sales strategy\\" were common sense for anyone who has a sales background. An additional disappointment was that for all of the good points and aspects that the authors attempted to make - they never provided the \\"WHY\\" for gathering the information that they suggest, following their sales tactics or other information. I would discourage anyone from purchasing this book. If you're looking for some great buys and reads then go for the following: \\"The Doctor as Customer,\\" by Dr. Andy Farah and \\"Be Brief.

I am looking forward to her next release."},{"Title":"Lights, Camera, Sex!","review":"I am a huge Christy Canyon fan and was hoping that what I'd find in her book was that she really enjoyed being a sex star. I wanted to hear that she loved the adult world and her fans and was glad to meet them every time she was performing.Instead, her real story is one of abuse that drove her from her home to a life she feels is unsatisfying. She is not a particular fan of the adult industry, even though she became one of it biggest stars, and was anxious to leave it as soon as she could find an alternative.If you want to remain a Canyon fan then don't read this book. If you do, you won't be able to watch her films or see her pictures in the same way again."},{"Title":"Lights, Camera, Sex!","review":"Being a big fan of Christys since the mid 80's I was looking forward to reading this book. I wasn't disappointed. She went to the top of an industry famous for chewing people up and spitting them out. But she did it on her own terms. From her screwed up family life to the way the adult film industry works this book was very entertaining and well written. She is not just another gorgeous face. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Lights, Camera, Sex!","review":"Let me just say that I enjoyed the book tremendously. It was very well written, and above all it was very sincere. That last part tends to be very uncommon among biographies, but you were not afraid to admit things that were hurtful as well as things that were probably very foolish. And whether you personally regret them or not, you were not shy about it.I was able to personally relate to the book, and that's probably why I liked it the most. My life early life happened to be very similar to yours even though I grew up on the other side of the Atlantic. All of a sudden I realized that what was true there was true here. I was able to relate to certain emotions displayed in your book, especially as a kid. Being split between parents, and dealing with their spouses was not always an easy task. I think striving for attention, and doing really foolish and stupid things. At the time I felt very bad. I was thinking I was the only person in the world it was happening to. And I was doing very bad things, and I felt I was never going to be anybody in life. At least my immediate surrounding made me feel like that. I think I was able to spot that in your book too. I found that to be very in common. I was thinking that if I knew you in school we probably would become friends. Of course if we knew about all of these things that we find in common. I think at the time I needed to know someone who felt this way. Just to know how to take it all inside, how to deal with it. I wonder if you felt the same way growing up? When I read your book I felt that I wasn't all alone in this. That along the lines many people were facing similar traumas, and not really knowing how to relate to it. I remember once I met a girl who also went through similar ordeal. I remember talking with her late night after work (haha-we worked at Kmart) I remember her telling me how she felt about her religion class as a child. They tell you how everything should be, rosy and all, and then you come home and it's the complete opposite. Did you ever feel like that? I really liked that girl at the time and hearing these things from her was like a revelation to me. It was like I'm not alone..etc. I think similar emotions came over me when reading your book. I felt your sadness, but I also felt your happiness.After reading this book I just feel like I know you more on the personal level. I know what went inside your head, and observed your thinking patterns. You're no longer a girl with beautiful body I happened to see as a late teenager. I think there is a lot of beauty inside you as well. I wonder to myself how I would react if I saw any of your movies now?On the other hand, I enjoyed your descriptions of the industry, most of it was really revealed to me for the first time. The fact that you've enjoyed your career was very positive. At least you didn't feel miserable like you did as a child. What an intense way to rebel. I've done quite a few rebelling acts myself. Most of which I'm not proud of, and probably should be left unspoken. In doing so, you are probably considered a legend, but you didn't loose your human factor. I really like that aspect about you. You're still approachable. I mean, even when you responded to my e-mail, that says a lot. When I read the book, I wish I could've written additional questions that popped in my head regarding some of the events. If you were to answer them all it probably could turn into an interview book.I found quite few things being very funny, and I did laugh a lot. Especially some dealing with men that you described were hilarious. Being a man myself I wondered how I would react in such situation because you can't help to think that. But, I can't help to see the difference in styles. You know like you read something, and just say that's not me, or the opposite as well. Well, life situations tend to be awkward and funny, that is why Seinfeld was so authentic and funny. You've quite a few of such moments. I think the funniest was the incident with the picture some guy sent it to you, and you gave it to that crazy woman on the street. I had a real laugh at that, very creative on your part, and unpredictable too.One thing which for sure is great is when you look back at you life, and consider how many things have happened. That's absolutely outstanding. You were able to make it into a book. And probably still have enough memories for a follow up or two. Being able to capture it in a fair, and not overly critical light''that's art."},{"Title":"Lights, Camera, Sex!","review":"Christy Canyon has done a fine job of bringing the reader right inside the adult film industry.This book somehow manages to be intelligent,informative and tittilating at the same time.Often times you think the story is wandering with the constant childhood flashbacks,but at the end of each chapter you'll understand her purpose.Very entertaining and shocking....bet you didn't know that ''Jethro'' from ''The Beverly Hillbillies'' was an absolute sex deviant that stalked pornstars.Christy Canyon lets a reader that also loves porn,like myself understand,that the performer that gives me so much entertainment is also a daughter,a lover,a wife,a friend,a student.A REAL PERSON!I for one appreciate Ms.Canyon for a lot more than I did before reading the book,and have a greater level of respect and appreciation for adult performers in general.Ms.Canyon is an entertaining writer as well.Buy it!!"},{"Title":"Lights, Camera, Sex!","review":"Christy's book is quite readable, though i agree with the use of the \\"flashbacks\\" as sort of a blaming device for the life choices she's made. It seems that porno was her only choice becuase of her parents - and even in her comeback, she kind of blames the fact that this ex of the dad's might be coming back to work. Nontheless, as a fan of 80s porn, this book is quite detailed in how a girl would break into the biz, and Christy was a star. the tidbits about her co-stars are great, but i kind of wish there were quadruple the amount of explicit stories and sordid tales. but what does make it into the book is very very fun, and it's a fun read altogether (i read it in 2 sittings.) I'm sure i'll get her next book, and i hope she's more honest about the sleaze and the sleaze she was involved in. what's great is her attention to detail - she has a cat-like memory for words and phrases - though sometimes too thorough in her recollections of conversations where maybe a sharper editor could've got to the ponit a bit more. Still, very very enjoyable and real and refreshing."},{"Title":"Lights, Camera, Sex!","review":"I've been a huge fan of Christy's since her earliest days in Adult Films. This, her first autobigraphy, has served to make me an even bigger fan by showing her human side, her humor, her stumbles and her perseverance.This is quite a lady who's been through a lot. Her writing is strong, witty and very engaging.While reading of her early days in film, a part of me felt a bit guilty about my complicity as a fan, however remote, in the early and instant success that she found in a life that so ostracized her from most members of her dear and broken family. But in an industry that chews up and spits out many pretty little girls, I learned of a Christy Canyon who grew, evolved and is now stronger than ever as a real woman.If you are interested in the woman or in the business, Christy's ride is a very good read. Buy \\"Lights, Camera, Sex!\\" and enjoy.The only reason I didn't give Christy's first work a full five stars is that she's working on her second book and I want her to have something to shoot for!Oh...and did I mention that I'm a FAN???"},{"Title":"Lights, Camera, Sex!","review":"Let us be blunt, dear reader. You are thinking of buying this book not for the everyday details of Christy Canyon's life, but really for the salacious parts. It is my unpleasant duty to inform you that, upon sludging your way through LIGHTS, CAMERA, SEX!, you will be sorely disappointed.There are a few juicy tidbits, to be sure. But nowhere near as many as one would hope for in a book about a woman who, again let us be blunt, makes her living by having sex in front of complete strangers and has it filmed for the whole world's viewing pleasure. I may not have wanted a book that was all smut and no biography, but LIGHTS, CAMERA, SEX! simply tilts too far the other way. We read over and over of Canyon's relationship with her father, her attempts to educate herself and such. Yet we read very little of what her fellow porn stars are really like, what the sex on camera was like, who she enjoyed it with and who she didn't.Added to this is that LIGHTS, CAMERA SEX! has to be the single most poorly edited book I have ever read. I am not a stickler here, but Canyon not only runs on sentences to the point of incoherence, but sometimes changes subjects midparagraph. The book is, at times, actually confusing to read as one does not know if Canyon is writing of the same time period from sentence to sentence or instead flashing back to another time without informing the readers. Even for a self-published book, it is often simply too much and really without excuse.Sorry Christy. I hate to do it. But I really have to recommend a proofreader next time around. It is the least you could really do for your fans."},{"Title":"Lights, Camera, Sex!","review":"With her exceptionally long and colorful career as a background, intelligent and quick-witted Christy Canyon has been able to create a biography above average. She worked with nearly all the legends of the 1980's and 90's adult industry and now she transmits the intense feel of the erstwhile porn scene to the reader - with all the ups and downs a young, enthusiastic artist could experience in the blue movies.While composing her book, Christy Canyon has found an excellent balance between her personal and professional life. Christy tells juicy details about her teenage years but avoids going into messiest details of her first sexual experiences. She reveals her initial, very simple reason to try her luck in the nude business as well as quite believeable details of the major porn persons and their methods to succeed and survive in that more or less ambivalent world.Christy's story is exciting, funny, instructional and from time to time a bit melancholic but basically, it's full of life. A highly readable, no-nonsense work; one of the very best biographies of a true high-end adult actressess ever published."},{"Title":"Lights, Camera, Sex!","review":"Lights, Camera, Sex! Revisited as I recollect my read of Christy Canyon's first effort I remember all the double entendres from Duran Duran's \\"Girls On Film.\\" Lights, Camera, Sex! has a narrative similar to that of Charles Bukowski's \\"Women.\\" At times when the tempo of the text escalates or desecalates I also remember the various driving rhythms and shifting tempos of all versions of \\"Gimmie, Gimmie\\" by legendary L.A. punk band Black Flag. Lights, Camera, Sex! is written by a woman who grew up in the Valley and who was on the scene in the early eighties as well as the nineties, let her tell her story, how she wants to tell it. In closing, about me, I am a published poet who has been published 7 times since 1992. I have also met Christy Canyon in person so many times over the past 10 years. Christy Canyon has invited me to read my poetry on the air for her radio show over the past year. Christy Canyon knows something about writing because when my material is good she tells me, when its bad she tells me. Christy Canyon can conduct interviews and when she is in her element she can trade one liners, entendres and innuedo with the best of them. If you are going to judge her ability based on Lights, Camera, Sex! alone then you really don't know the woman behind the stage name. In closing, read \\"Women\\" by Charles Bukowski, listen to Duran Duran's \\"Greatest Hits\\" as well as \\"Everything Went Black\\" by Black Flag. Porn King, John Holmes, once said \\"We are all from the same tree, treat people as your equal.\\""},{"Title":"Lights, Camera, Sex!","review":"An excellent book about Christy Canyon. Very entertaining book. Some great stories and a few oh my moments. Like Christy herself, a great reflection of one of the most amazing woman in the adult industry. Very in-depth and personnel experience make for a very fun read. Worth the time to read. You will enjoy it."},{"Title":"Lights, Camera, Sex!","review":"Being a huge fan over the years, Christy, along with Ginger Lynn, pretty much paved the 80s road to porn for many other women who would come and eventually go. I enjoyed the fact she pulled no punches (at least I don't think she did) when it came to telling her story. For some strange reason, the book ended on page 298 right in the middle of a conversation with her personal trainer. Confused? Yes. Disaappointed? Thoroughly. Did anyone else have this issue or is it just an isolated incident? Please reply if this wasn't the case with you. I felt the book didn't end for me and the promise of a second autobiography hasn't materialized."},{"Title":"Lights, Camera, Sex!","review":"Christy Canyon has produced a remarkably well-written autobiography. The other commentators no doubt have a point on the subject of punctuation. I have however noticed that most younger Americans writing in on any subject on the Internet, only seem to know the dot at the end of a sentence as the only form of punctuation anyhow. For those who would like to get to know the person behind the performer, this book is highly informative. Those lured to the sales counter by the promised &quot;juicy behind the scenes details&quot; are however in for a disappointment. Few performer's names are mentioned at all, and most of the time the mere mention is what you will have to be content with. The fact that most performers - like Christy Canyon - don't bother much with the script will come as no great surprise; nor, that Ron Jeremy is not to be trusted near a fully stocked salad bar. So it's a great tell-all book if all you want to know about concerns the author. And many will consider it a bonus to find that Christy has personally signed the copy that they have ordered."},{"Title":"Lights, Camera, Sex!","review":"Anyone who believes that erotic movies should have their own category at the Oscars will enjoy this book. I have only read the first 124 pages, and I'm recommending it. You will recognize all the names of her fellow performers, and learn how the sex film industry works. (In case you didn't already know how it works.) Ms. Canyon also relates a meeting with Max Baer, who played Jethro on \\"The Beverly Hillbillies.\\"One negative. The authoress has an annoying habit of employing \\"flashbacks,\\" apparently in an attempt to show that she is not merely a fantastic sex object. She does not speak well about her father, but maybe, if we talked to him, we would get another side of the story. He may not be happy that his daughter is this type of actress.Another thing. Wanting to sound like an authentic dumb porno girl, Ms. Canyon has cleverly placed misspellings and hilarious punctuation blunders throughout the book. Very effective!It's a good read. It's entertaining, it's informative.I look forward to the next book, Ms. Canyon."},{"Title":"Lights, Camera, Sex!","review":"Christy Canyon's memoir of the porn industry is great. However, her account of her own life is quite boring and egotistical. Unfortunately, her editor decided it would be a good idea to flashback to her childhood, periodically throughout her accounts of the porn industry. Christy's rise in the porn industry is a very interesting and exciting tale to read. To her credit, she writes her experiences in great detail and gives the dirt on many porn stars. I reccomend that the reader should solely focus on her porn career and skip all of the passages on her personal life with her family. Also, Christy thinks quite highly of herself. At one point she proclaims herself to be exceptionally better than a homeless woman because she EARNED her money. Christy also goes on and on about how beautiful she is.

From the porn star Christie Canyon,I thought was a typical biography cut from the same mold from every Successfull Hollywood actress.She says in her book that her father was bad.But,the funny thing is that she is just like her father who is materialistic,arrogant,self centered,selfish,drugged out of her mind,money hungry,and fat and has cellulite on her rear end and her legs.She also never even did anything good with the money she got.it all went to her cocaine,and her porche that got stolen 6days later.As usual all of these Hollywood actresses bodies are infested with cocaine and coffee.No wonder why they are so stupid and untalented.She also says to adopt animals from a shelter .she should practice what she preaches.Which she doesn\`t.The good thing about this biography is I payed 15 dollars for it.Personally I don\`t think it is worth 15 dollars it is worth about 50 cents.To all of you who read this especially you guys,remember alll beautifull women are money hungry and stupid and full of trouble degrade them when you see them guys."},{"Title":"Lights, Camera, Sex!","review":"I have seen Christy Canyon for a long time and she was in many videos in her career but what I remember is Pretty Peaches and I think that was the beginning of her career.

They are her own words, they are not edited, and dramatized by an editor that would take the feeling and tone away.Using experiences from her childhood we can get the idea of things from her childhood that effected her career and how she got into the adult entertainment industry.Told in her own words and edited by her own hands, this is an up close and personal account of her career.Very few other tell-all authors have done likewise."},{"Title":"Lights, Camera, Sex!","review":"This book is suppossed to be an autobography of porn star Christy Canyon. What it is instead is a vehicle for graphic descriptions of her sex scenes against a background of bad, bad english. The book starts innocently enough, with Christy describing how she got into porn and the feelings associated with her new career. As the book progresses, she seems to care less about the story of her life and more about how every moment of every sex scene she ever did felt and looked like. It gets tedious and boring - Wow Christy, you had sex? What next? Oh, you did it several more times. Apparently the editor of the book also got bored halfway through, because the grammer and spelling took a turn for the worse. Either that or the book was partially written by a fourth grader (shiver). Ads at the back of the book for her next book about her life stripping, and encouragements to buy several more copies of the book you just finished reading (?!) further destroy the credibility.She gets some stars for effort, and insight (albeit shallow) into the porn industry. Traci Lords' \\"Underneath It All\\" is a better read, both for content and mechanics."},{"Title":"Lights, Camera, Sex!","review":"Dear Christy,I LOVE your book. The way you look at yourself in a non-victim-way, the combining of childhood memories with backstage-images of now and then: great.

And I guess, no one could have told this better than you do.So: thanx.Robert"},{"Title":"Lights, Camera, Sex!","review":"Please Ms. Canyon, Please.If she said it once in the book she said it 100 times. Oh poor me,mommy and daddy actually had other things going on in their lives and that is wrong, because you have to devote all your love and focus all your attention on me.I am reminded of a Border Collie who never stops begging for attention until the owner can't stand it any longer and gently banishes the dog to the back yard,if just for peace and quiet. Many people have had less than perfect parents,but very few use the fact as a crutch,or a reason for choices made.I suppose I bought the book out of curiosity.I have always wondered what makes a person get inolved in the adult industry, when the stories so often end in heartbreak. If I take this story as truth,Ms. Canyon started and stayed(quit and came back),etcetera,etcetera because she found the one thing she could do where all the attention was focused on her.Perhaps she does not on a conscious level understand this.Nobody ever watched her films,they looked at them,which is what I gather she really wanted anyway.I found great humor in the way Ms.Canyon labels other people freaks for their...ahem,peculiar tastes,yet expects us the reader to view her as just another hardworking American Girl. I also took particular exception to her derogatory descriptive terms regarding the homeless.They are what they are, but they never exploited themselves.If you have read the book...did anybody but me notice that Ms. Canyon eventually finds fault with each of her friends?Overall,I was very disappointed in the book.I learned nothing,other than the fact that Ms.Canyon thinks very highly of herself and she expects us to do the same.I'm sorry I spent the money to give her the attention she so desperately craves."},{"Title":"Lights, Camera, Sex!","review":"Porn is without a doubt,one of the most vile evils that this world has ever seen.Porn has inspired rape,incest,pedophillia,sadomasichism,and so many other sinful acts.Just way too many to mention.Porn has also destroyed millions of lives and families all across this world.Whether it's porn addiction,marriage break up's and/or other evils.Porn is sick! Not only does it cause all of this,it also degrades women and puts them to the lowest of standards.Many of women that have had involvment in porn,will even admit to the shame,guilt and disgust that they have felt when doing this.Most of which,have done this for money,and needed a quick buck.The porn industry takes advantage of this,and lines their own pockets.They make their loads of cash,by humilating these young women and stealing away their innocence.Many times,putting an emotional scar on them for the rest of their life.America and everywhere else on the Earth,NEEDS to take a stand against this filth that has polluted our culture for years."},{"Title":"Lights, Camera, Sex!","review":"Scarlett O'Hara is one of the few protagonists who is completely unlikable but incredibly compelling. Christy Canyon is a whining brat who insults others' appearances in order to build herself up and seems completely clueless on WHY her family and friends react to her life choices.She goes on to say that she had no other choice to survive, but it's so hard to believe. Especially when she cries over and over again that it was the lack of paternal attention that drove her to her lifestyle. Okay, so you learned you can't count on your dad. All her musings are completely superficial, and she never goes on to say HOW her upbringing affected her choices and mindset.No interesting inside information of the industry whatsoever and it feels like she transcribed her diary word for word. Especially since she introduces characters for the first time as if the reader had already known who they were from the get go.If you're a fan of her movies, skim through for the sexual memories. If you're a fan of literature and memoirs, skip it.One must admire the self publisher; a writer who receives countless \\"no thank you\\"s from publishing companies but still believes her manuscript is worth reading by anyone but her family."},{"Title":"Lights, Camera, Sex!","review":"Christy Canyon's biography is a stunning achievement because it shows the person behind the pornstar. Brilliant, candid, graphic, hilarious, revealing, and with all of its pain and beauty, Christy lets us in.

Her life is not unlike any of our own thus making her journey accesible, fun and harrowing all at the same time. This book is not just for the fans, its for everyone. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Lights, Camera, Sex!","review":"I did enjoy this book, but it ends half way through the story, enabling a follow up to written. A lot of the chapters begin in this book but are incomplete and reading the follow up will neccesitate to find out the complete story. Christy is where a lot of teenagers are at, entering a maze that can send you down the well or you sink then swim to survive. It would appear on her career choice she was heading towards the well and again when involved in drugs, but she surfaced an astute business person, comfortable with her career paths."},{"Title":"Lights, Camera, Sex!","review":"Christy Canyon proves how wrong negative stereotypes of female porn stars are. Her curves and bedroom talents arouse fans of her movies; her brains and honesty in this first volume of her memoirs excite our admiration too. Professional editing would improve her writing, but take this for what it is: a strong first book by a writer without literary training. In that light, this book is impressive indeed. Everyone interested in porn should read Ms. Canyon's book, whether they favor porn or despise it. Ms. Canyon is fair-minded, harsh on those who deserve it, kind to everyone else, endearingly candid about herself, and artlessly eloquent. May her literary skills grow with her wisdom as she lives on, and may she live long and happily."},{"Title":"Lights, Camera, Sex!","review":"This book is a good effort by almost anyone's standards. Christy comes across as candid, articulate, and reflective - the opposite of the trite \\"porn bimbo\\" sterotype. Better, unlike certain other memoirists she declines to play The Victim, or to rage in bitter resentment over the unfairness of an industry driven by youth and money. Christy (or her helpers) are not contending for any literary prizes here, but the prose is vigorous and interesting throughout. Her story is told -- good and bad -- with perspective and maturity. Clearly, her intelligence must have always been one part of her tremendous sex appeal."},{"Title":"Lights, Camera, Sex!","review":"Christy Canyon was one of my fave porn stars back in my teen years.

Christy shipped the same day she got my purchase order, too, which is absolutely fantastic customer service!The story Christy tells contains more details than I would have thought possible to remember from years ago. Her story is open and honest, not sugar-coated or aggrandized. I have always wondered what it looked like behind the scens in the world of porn, and this seems to be a real, gritty story. One woman's viewpoint, certainly. I look forward to her follow-up volume.The editing mistakes herein are of a pretty basic sort. It seems a spell-checker was used, but the book would have benefited greatly from a more exhaustive proof-reading. Example: referring to high-heeled shoes as &quot;heals&quot;. Heals is a valid word, but obviously not the one intended. The layout of the book could have been better physically. There are widowed lines on pages, and publishing information appears on the frint of the title page, not on the back.Still, the content is what is most important, and the content is solid.

One story that stood out was a scene with a guy who dripped sweat onto Christy, which immediately grossed her out.The book has some slow parts, mainly some of the mundane stories of her non-porn life. Still, I enjoyed this book. I liked that it did not seem to over-sensationalize the business. I recommend checking it out if you are curious about the industry or Christy."},{"Title":"Lights, Camera, Sex!","review":"One of the most celebrated names in porn ,Christy Canyon is insightful as she is poetic to read.

I am waiting for her second book.The pictures were a nice addition."},{"Title":"Lights, Camera, Sex!","review":"I've never written a review for a book before in my life, and it'll no doubt show, but bear with me. I felt like this book was worth an attempt!I didn't buy this book for the sex. A strange statement, perhaps, but it's true. I bought it because I love a good, interesting story. Often, books dealing with time in the adult industry make for uncomfortable reading. \\"Ordeal\\" by Linda Lovelace being one example. So I kind of began reading this with one eye shut and in a state of uneasiness. However, upon completing it 48 hours later, I'd have to say that this is not the book I expected it to be.One of the effects of porn may be that it traps individuals in the roles they play. So that after the dvd or the vhs tape is ejected they remain forever in the memory wearing stockings and suspenders, insatiable (and unnaturally flexible!). It's often hard to think of those stars as people with family problems, having trouble finding stable relationships, who make these bold statements of sexual liberation and then have to deal with the social stigma that can accompany it when they go back to the world. But these are the things that are laid out in honest, forthright detail by Christy over the course of the book.It strikes me as being two very distinct parts; \\"less control\\" and \\"more control\\". The first part deals with all the personal circumstances leading to Christy becoming involved in the adult film industry. It seems, to me anyway, that Christy still hadn't yet fully gained control of her life at this stage. She details her struggles to make ends meet, her extremely close relationship with her sister Clair, and her tentative steps into modeling which brought her, gradually, into adult movies. This is the half which details the drug problems, the difficulties in maintaining relationships with her family, and the often unsavory business practices of some photographers. Yet it's at this point, having been on the receiving end of an improper advance from a photographer called \\"Ed\\" that the \\"less control\\" portion of the book ends, with Christy screaming \\"IT'S MY JOB! IT'S NOT WHO I AM!\\". It's almost like a switch is flicked and that's the final act of Christy working \\"for\\" the porn industry to the road which would lead to Christy making the porn industry work for her.There is then a gap between leaving the adult business, working in her fathers office, and then making a comeback but it's the style of the return that intrigued me. From the decision to see a counseller to address the issues in her life that troubled her, to the way that rather than being at the behest of an agency she walks into the offices of Vivid and lays out what she requires before she'll work for them. In an industry which is accused of dis-empowering women, it's great to see someone so in command of their own life this way.In closing, I really enjoyed reading this book. I don't know Christy but through reading about her life, I feel like she's emerged from a potentially destructive business with a level head and only a few scars to show. I hope that's the case, because what she went through to get where she is a testament to her determination to succeed on her own terms. Whatever your views on porn, you have to admire her spirit. I look forward to the next chapter."},{"Title":"Lights, Camera, Sex!","review":"As soon as I received my copy of Lights, Camera, Sex, in the mail, I knew it would be good! I've read biographies from other pornstars but was anticipating this one because Christy is my favorite pornstar. As with everything else she has done in her career, the book was great! It was a real eye opener to hear her talk about her experiences in the field with such porn legends as Peter North, Ron Jeremy, and Tom Byron. The reader learns about what a certain underage porn star was really like behind and in front of the camera! It was also refreshing to hear Christy talk about life with her family, and how she coped working for her father when she decided to leave porn.The book is an honest look at porn and Christy makes no excuses for choosing to work in the industry. By reading this book you can truly tell that this is a woman who is truly happy with herself and the choices she has made in her life! As for the nitpickers who are complaining about the typos, they are corrected in the second printing, which I am buying : ) I loved the cliffhanger ending and I eagerly await book 2."},{"Title":"Lights, Camera, Sex!","review":"I happened upon this book due to it's catchy and interesting title and bold red covers!! I knew, or rather heard of Ms.Canyon, so I was excited yet didn't know what to expect??! Well needless to say this was a great read. This is no ditzy broad who was exploited, blah, blah, blah.... Christy tells you her story in a very frank and abrupt manner. She did what she had to do in order to survive and live, and her story is phenomenal. Hard to put down once you get into it, so expect to knock this book out rather quickly. Just found out that part two is in the works, well I'll definitely be picking up that! So if you are interested in the world of porn, \\"and who really isn't?\\", this book will give you an idea of what goes down on and around the sets, other stars both from porn and hollywood are mentioned and overall it's a great book. This is the life story of Ms. Christy Canyon for better or worse!! ENJOY ALL!!"},{"Title":"Lights, Camera, Sex!","review":"Among the jobs you don't want to tell your parents you got is porn star. In a way this was easy for Christy Canyon. At eighteen, she wasn't speaking to her parents anyway, and she had left them to get on her own. Nonetheless, one of the themes that even the most conservative will approve of in _Lights, Camera, Sex! An Autobiography_ is that Christy loved her family, as disrupted and misguided as her parents may have sometimes been, and wanted to be back with them and accepted. It won't be giving anything away to say that she got her wish. After all, among the generous three pages of dedications at the front of the book are loving notes to her mom and dad, and especially to her sister who during some periods had to act as her ambassador to them. Among the other dedications is one to her producer at Vivid Video, the last studio she worked with, thanking her lucky stars that &quot;... you spoon-fed me all those years under contract and never asked me to do anything you knew I wouldn't do anyway.&quot; Even when as close as she could get to family was her cast and crew making sex films, Christy found supportive friends, and it seems she remains sweetly grateful. It is impossible to say how representative her experience in porn was. However, it is hard to say she was taken advantage of when she was making deliberate decisions to promote and protect herself, and she was able to get out of many uncomfortable situations and assignments. It might be a little surprising that there is so much self-examination in her book and so much reflection on family matters, but it can't be surprising that she has some good stories to tell, and it isn't at all surprising that she is uninhibited in telling them.One surprise is that she tells the stories in an unexpectedly sophisticated way. She has not told the chronological story of her life. The first pages deal with her first appointment in Hollywood at World Modeling in 1984, but throughout the book, a memory will lurch her back into some experience from her past. On one page, there might be intercalated sentences of memories alternating with events of the moment. She was tricked into going to her first movie shoot, which she thought would be merely the nude still modeling she had been doing. Her agent said it would be a piece of cake: &quot;It's nothing that you haven't done in your personal life. It's one quick sex scene.&quot; He even assured her it could be in her favorite position. Canyon was remarkably inexperienced in sexual matters for one who had rebelled against her parents and hit the road, but to help her agent out, she agreed just this one time; the pay for the day's work being $1,500 was one of the advantages. She froze on the first shoot, but eventually got to enjoy doing scenes. She realized that with the few men she had been with in her personal life, she was inhibited: &quot;I never wanted the guy to think I was some sex-crazed maniac&quot; so she had reined herself in. On camera, though, nobody minded &quot;how loud I moaned and groaned... I realized how much fun it was just to enjoy sex.&quot; She learned she enjoyed sex when it was with another woman, or with more than one person, and she did not at all mind getting paid for it.Not everything went smoothly. Canyon developed a coke habit, which she later shook, and she had to fend off unwanted advances from some sleazebags. She had to deal with lots of criticism from strangers, some of whom would write her to say that if she only had faith, God would save her from the business she was in. &quot;I was always perplexed by how these types acquired my fan club address as it was only printed in porn magazines.&quot; She got burned out on making films and went to work for her dad's accounting business, but came back to porn with a renewed business sense and also an interest in her paychecks funding her education. Years after she left home, she was even accepted back by her mother and dad, even while she continued her chosen profession; her book makes clear that for all she has managed to do for herself, regaining the love of her parents was the accomplishment she valued most. _Lights, Camera, Sex!_ is a unique look at one woman's experience in the porn film industry. It is unpolished; there are spelling and punctuation errors throughout, but while this would be a difficulty in other works, it is part of the book's charm that Canyon wrote it all herself without hiring an editor or an &quot;As Told To&quot;. When a company expressed interest in publishing the work, but wanted to change it around, she published it herself. Look elsewhere if you seek a confessional from a porn star as victim; this is a story by a victor."},{"Title":"Lights, Camera, Sex!","review":"I had no idea what to expect, had no idea that the woman could even string two sentences together. Guess what? This is one of the best autobiographies I have ever read. Yes, I knew her from the videos; no, her acting wasn't much, in fact, she never could act worth a...but how many of us rented her videos to see her act? Right.Know what else I'm glad about? That deep down, in her heart and soul, she turns out to be monogamous and has finally settled down with a decent guy.Yes, she was always a looker, hot, not a great beauty, per se, but put it all together and, man, she had it. I can't even put my finger on it exactly...maybe a Sophia Loren type...Maybe some other guys out there were like me, found her incredibly attractive, but always wondered what this person was like; was she human at all? Was she capable of being with just one guy, all that. And the answer to that question, and many others, is in this book.Troubled childhood? You better believe it. On her own before she turned eighteen. Lived through her share of hard times. Some of it sad enough to almost bring tears to your eyes, and some of it is hilarious enough to actually do exactly that: bring tears to your eyes.It's worth reading...and, in my opinion, would make one hell of a motion picture.So why then, after all this praise, would I not give our Christy five stars? Here it is: (and it can easily be corrected) punctuation throughout this edition is off; commas are missing and there are typos that can easily be taken care of.First couple of pages (title page, etc.) also should be re-done so that it does not look like a self-published book).A professional editor could take care of this without breaking a sweat. It really would be worth it, Christy--because you have one hell of a story here. And don't worry, it'll still be your book, your writing, your baby. Greats like Hemingway, Thomas Wolf, etc., etc., all of them, have had help in this area. It won't take away from the fact that it is ENTIRELY YOUR CREATION.Can't wait for part II."},{"Title":"Lights, Camera, Sex!","review":"80s porn legend Christy Canyon shares the professional highs and personal lows of her life as a porn queen. The book alternates between harrowing (her very first hardcore shoot) to hilarious (the shooting of her first comeback scene) as Canyon goes from a naive and rebellious runaway teenager to a therapy strengthened professional ready to earn her true worth. Canyon manages to tell very personal, and sometimes quite painful, stories while maintaining a level headed distance from the subject matter (herself). Thus the reader gets a pretty detailed look at how working in such an industry can either be empowering or demoralizing, and how easy it is to be taken advantage of or to be treated poorly for doing so. Love or hate the adult film industry, by the book's end you will probably have an admiration for the financial success and mental balance that Canyon has obviously worked so hard to achieve. Recommended."},{"Title":"Lights, Camera, Sex!","review":"I read this book because I've always thought that Christy Canyon was the smartest and probably most attractive of all the porn stars I have seen over the years. While I have to say this is probably still true, the book at best is mediocre.It does start out strong and it is intereting how she got into pornography. After that though, you should probably put down the book and stop reading because it doesn't get more interesting. Thus the title of my review; the other reviewers must be fans of her on-screen capability. So much so that they are willing to give her a pass for her book.On the other hand, it takes much longer to read a book and it is substantially more of an intellectual exercise than to watch one or even most of her films. The investment should have more payoff and reward from an intellectual standpoint vs. a carnal one.With the above in mind, her book leaves a bit to be desired.1. It doesn't blow the lid off of celebrity. She really only discusses meeting one major celeb and that person is a has-been. If I go by her book, she really hasn't met or didn't articulate any experience with real big time Hollywood talent. Or New York or even Michigan talent for that matter.2. The overviews she gives of porn's celebrity such as the owner of Vivid or Ron Jeremy is pretty weak. Again, I expected some reasonable detail for someone that has been in the business as long as she has. Her descriptions of interactions with Tom Byron, Ron Jeremy and so on is lacking. Her best description was of her interaction with Tracy Lords. And it took some serious verbage for her to get to that (the payoff wasn't worth the work).3. She dedicates much of the book to her parents. Without spoiling the book, I have to say this perplexed me, especially when the bulk of the book is dedicated to spelling out some major shortcomings of her parents.There are gaps in logic in the book. The end of the book really leaves you wanting and end of the book. She fails to tie up loose ends and adequately give the reader what she desperately needs; closure.After reading her descriptions of her sex scenes, the reader is led to believe she only had sex only a hand full of times and that she really didn't enjoy it, it was just a job that she muddled through. Unfortunately Christy downplays her ability to actually do what she was good at and again that logic thing comes up, she actually did a substantial number of films, her later one's being far more mediocre than her mid-career flicks. It misses the essential description of dynamics of her films, what made her exciting in them and why she thought her chemistry was right for the screen (which it is in many cases).I'll put it as simply as I can - I expected much more. A disasppointing read at best."},{"Title":"Lights, Camera, Sex!","review":"Ever wonder what a porn star's day-to-day life is like? If you're reading this review, I'm thinking the answer is \\"yes.\\" Here is Christy Canyon to answer the questions you may have on what happens \\"behind the scenes\\" in the life of an adult film starlet.Christy is one of the pioneers of the adult film business. Sure, there were XXX actors before her. However, she blossommed during the mid-1980s, at which time the business exploded thanks to the invention of the VCR.Christy takes us on a \\"grand tour\\" of what happens inside the world of porn. We're introduced to all the shady characters who lurk in the shadows, as well as what REALLY happens on a porn set.Christy is far from a perfect human being. However, she never professes to be bereft of shortcomings. This auto-biography is a very intimate look at Christy the person, and it does not attempt to cover up the shortcomings of her character. She openly writes of her struggles with cocaine as well as her flakiness. As an honest approach, I found that to be very refreshing.Along those same lines, she does not pull any punches when it comes to her opinion of people. She slams people she doesn't like and she speaks glowingly of people she does like. It seems to me that most every male who ever crossed her path is in one of two categories: she either adored them or absolutely hated them.For those who may wonder if she is explicit in detailing her sexploits, there is no need to worry. She gives a visual description of several of her scenes. There are no \\"oblique references\\" that could be found in other biographies (I've heard that Traci Lord's bio is like that).An unexpected touch of the book is humor. For a woman who has sex for a living, it's surprising how difficult it was for her to find a partner who was not a \\"freak\\" outside the business. Christy's hilarious sexual mis-adventures are sure to bring a smile to your face!If you want to know about the \\"old school\\" pornstars, or are simply curious about the world of porn in general, then this book is for you. The bio starts out with a bang with Christy's first interaction with the business. Her going into the studio to arrange her first photoshoots reminded me of the hero crossing the threshold in a Jungian \\"hero's journey.\\" The rest, they say, is history. Christy's history. And, it's worth your time to read."},{"Title":"Lights, Camera, Sex!","review":"I enjoyed this book, but it wasn't everything I was hoping for. Christy doesn't dish much about the industry or her colleagues, and I think her book would have been a better read if she gave us some juicy tidbits, as did Jerry Butler in his (admittedly self-indulgent and self-serving) book. She was in adult films for decades and has worked with just about every star that anyone's ever heard off, yet she only mentions a handfull (Peter North, Ron Jeremy, Billy Dee, Traci Lords, Ginger Lynn), and says little about them. She shares even less behind-the-scenes insight, other than in the context of her \\"firsts\\" (first black man, first threesome, etc.). C'mon Sweetie, you're just dancing now -- what are you afraid of?If you're a fan of Christy's, however, you'll enjoy reading about her life and her path to porn. Although there's little to learn beyond the stereotypical didn't-get-along-with-my-family story that most porn chicks and strippers relate, it's her story, so the hardcore (no pun intended) fan will be into it. The book has some editorial glitches (\\"heals\\" vs. \\"heels\\") but overall it's worth the time. And mine came signed by the author herself, so, to paraphrase Bill Murray in \\"Caddyshack\\", it had that going for it. Which was nice."},{"Title":"Lights, Camera, Sex!","review":"Christy's candid (and often painful) recollections lend heart to this book, something not found in recent adult star memoirs.Sure, there are juicy tidbits from behind the scenes and anecdotes suggesting that the freaks aren't necessarily the ones in the show (refer to Max Baer and the &quot;silver bullet,&quot; respectively), but there's no hint of Raw Talent's arrogance or Underneath It All's sugar coating.Equal parts cautionary tale (particularly for parents and those contemplating adult entertainment careers) and personal triumph, Canyon proves herself a self-respecting, resilient survivor. She (refreshingly) refuses to shy away from or downplay her past and self-assuredly forges into the future.Not a bad read from a first time author, there's an ease to Christy's story telling that will only grow with future works."},{"Title":"Lights, Camera, Sex!","review":"Overall I enjoyed the book, but I feel a need to point out a few shortcomings.This is really volume 1 of at least 2 books, the second one which is apparently in the works. So this book has no strong conclusion. If you're expecting a tidy finish to her story, forget it. This book follows Christy up to about 1992 or so.This book starts off with the literary quality of a seventh grade book report. However, the writing quality steadily improves as Christy finds her voice. Still, the lack of a real editor is glaringly apparent. I honestly don't think there was an editor aside from Christy and whoever she ran the material by. That's my impression from the way the book reads, and that it was apparently self published.The book bounces around between her childhood traumas and her porn career. That is actually a blessing, because if she started off with her childhood and worked linearly through her life I probably would have lost interest in the first few pages. The flashbacks to childhood contain a lot of whining about her parents, who apparently were standard LA-issue self-absorbed upper-middle class types. Nothing ever clearly answers \\"why porn?\\".If you're looking for lurid sexual details, you will find few in this book. If you're looking for an expose on the porn industry or cameo biographies of major porn players, you'll be disappointed.If you want to know more about Christy, how she thinks, and how she views the world you'll like this book. Personally, I wouldn't spend full price on it if I had it to do all over again. With that said, if the sequel has a professional editor and the price is more like that of a pulp paperback, I'll give it a read."},{"Title":"Lights, Camera, Sex!","review":"That's what Christy wrote on the inside cover of my copy. And you know what? I did enjoy the ride (no pun intended). Although the poor editing of this book is difficult to overlook, I found that the content more than made up for it. There is plenty of gossip and detail in this book, but what sets it apart from the rest is Miss Canyon's sparkling personality. She is beyond witty and just plain laugh-out-loud fun. If you're looking for deep insight and wisdom regarding the porn business, this is not the book for you. If you're looking for an entertaining inside story about the porn business and one of its stars, then you may really enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Lights, Camera, Sex!","review":"Christy Canyon has written a very interesting book about her career in pornography. The words feel like the truth. You won't be seduced into believing this is a great career move and you won't be fooled into thinking that Ms. Canyon is the woman you want to take home to meet the folks. She is neither a victim nor a proponent.I have read other insider books (e.g. Jerry Butler) and outsider books (e.g. Luke Ford) and sexpert books (e.g. Susie Bright, Carol Queen) and saw Boogie Nights but this book was the most satisfying in terms of my curiousity of what it is like to work in XXX. I recommend this book for those who are similarly curious. Those looking for a simple turn on will be disappointed.Some have criticized this book for an excess of typos. One that I spotted was \\"striper\\" instead of \\"stripper\\". Well, a spell-checker program would miss that one also. But I have read technical books with more typos than this one. More distracting was the sloppy page layout. I suspect the phrase \\"orphan management\\" refers only to the musical Annie as far as this book's producer is concerned. The book would also be better with some pictures - even simple black and white photographs showing Christy Canyon in a pose not intended for a video cassette box."},{"Title":"Lights, Camera, Sex!","review":"It is not difficult to understand why there are so many mixed reviews of Christy Canyon's autobiography. But the majority of the less-than-stellar reviews are made by readers who really missed the point of the book. These reviews are largely based on superficial shortcomings which include typos and the lack of titilating material. But we all know that including such content would be an easy way out for the author. This is the author's perspective of her own life in her own words. The typos come with the perk of reading Christy's work in her own words and this makes the content all the more geniune and substantive. If this book wasn't self-published then Christy wouldn't even have the option of choosing its title.Naturally, an autobiography will be colored by the author's perspective on her own experiences. This is inevitable. But if you can identify with some of these experiences (I know there are many readers with dysfunctional families and bad relationships) you'll definitely find this book an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Lights, Camera, Sex!","review":"Christy Canynon is one of adult films first female superstars and gives a great insight into the making and lifestyle of the adult film industry.Christy relates her encounters with adult films famous and infamous stars including, Ginger Lynn, Ron Jeremy, Peter &quot;Don't touch my hair&quot; North and Traci Lords.Christy also gives insights into her childhood and her family life both before and after the adult film career. This book is a worthwhile read for fans of Christy and the adult film genre."},{"Title":"Lights, Camera, Sex!","review":"I didn't love or hate the book...I felt it reflect what the adult industry likes to show about the porn business...poor young mistreated girl needs to survive and goes into the porn business, trouble family...only mental abuse...and she find the love and attention she has craved. ( She does admit she was very popular in high school and was loved by all and everyone wanted her.) Okay sorry back to the book she never recieved the attention from her Daddy and Mommy as she puts it...because their lives are messed up also. To survive she takes the hard step gasp and goes to a modeling agency and soon is having sex on film. She makes enough money to move to a nice area and buy a car, her life is loveless. So she finally empowers her self and quits the business only to make come backs when a.) she needs money,b.) her Daddy makes her mad...in all of these tell all adult books no one ever bites the hand that feeds them, they never say the porn industry was a bad choice, I was young, I was used. The people are alway like family and even though she admits most of her first 8 months she had almost no time and was constantly booked for films and photo shoots. The book seems to skim quickly through those months when she is a novice in the business, she is 18. At one point I though she had to be at least 24 from all the work she had spoken about and she still is only 18. I also started to skim through her mistreatments by her Daddy toward the end (She constantly alternates between her present porn experiences (at 18) and her childhood traumas; one of them he would leave them with their grandmother if he had a date, oh the horror.)(Her whining about a homeless woman who was conning people, instead of working was comical; hadn't she been running the biggest con, blowing money as fast as she could make only to go back to fake some orgasms when her bank account dipped.)To sum up, as one person said in their review: they felt like she started to hold back her life story for her next book. Oh life does imitate her art."},{"Title":"Lights, Camera, Sex!","review":"There are three types of readers who might like this book: bored young housewives who need to fill time on a slow 3-day flight to China, middle aged men who remember watching Christy's early films like Battle of the Stars and finding an urge to squirt a certain white fluid after they got home, and obsessed psychotic fans who must read a detailed diary of every thing she does, favorite clothes, freaky dates, etc. to add to their collection of warning notices (\\"Keep away from Christy's house\\") big enough to paper an entire wall. All of you in group two will wish you kept your money with all the put downs of the men in her life. Max Baer is an impotent voyuer who incurs a huge dose of her wrath. Typos are in the text while she once again gathers sympathy Traci Lords style for her childhood with a divorced, stingy father who later rescues her from career burnout and cocaine abuse to work for him as his secretary. Christy Canyon had what most people envy, an expensive home in Burbank where she attended a wealthy private high school. She proves my opinion with this book that she's really a spoiled bratty bitch searching for punishment or rebellion in a porn career. She now hosts a show on satellite radio along with Ginger Lynn to interview porn legends and give beginners advice on porn acting. She ends telling us she found a guard for her new strip show tour. After so much cocaine abuse, maximum security or minimum cell? The great irony is that when staff from her radio show sue for sex harrassment, maybe the bodyguard is needed to protect Christy's public FROM her, instead of vice versa."},{"Title":"Lights, Camera, Sex!","review":"This book is fantastic. I have been listening to Christy Canyon on Playboy Radio's night calls for over a year now. My husband used to watch her movies. I love her even more after reading her book. She has been through so much in her life and has come out on top! She is inspirational. I recommend anyone who has seen porn to read this book. I can't wait for the second one to come out. I couldn't put it down. I got my book in a respectable length of time and in great condition. I am very pleased!"},{"Title":"Lights, Camera, Sex!","review":"As a fan of christy during the 80's and 90's, i enjoyed the book very much. My title explains just that, she can't disclose everything ? Any time someone of her stature and position, i think has the right to write want she/he wants to. I think she is going to write a second volume which is well worth the wait. I just plain out enjoyed her book. I think if she wrote about everything from day one till, when ever, she would have lost the reader ? You can only write about sex so much that it gets redudant. I highly recomend this book for all that enjoyed the ground breaking vhs era of the 80's ( adult video 0 and to all of Chrity's fans...a must read..."},{"Title":"Lights, Camera, Sex!","review":"This is a nice written, entertaining book. I would like a bit more on the 80's porn subject and scene and a bit less on her troubled personal life and relationship with his father. But it is a nice purchase, and there aren't that many porn actress bios out there!"},{"Title":"Lights, Camera, Sex!","review":"Whether friend, fan or curious stranger, read this! \\"Lights, Camera, Sex!\\" is a must for any fan of the legendary Christy Canyon, considered by those who know and care as one of the greatest adult stars of the twentieth century, if not the greatest. But it's more. It is an always interesting story of the adult video industry by a lady who not only survived but thrived. She intersperses industry behind the scenes stories with insights to the life and times of an intelligent and witty \\"valley girl\\" and the people and experiences that shaped her.This book may be disappointing to those who like their adult stars stereotypically stupid sluts. But like other successful and enduring performers, Christy does not fit that clich&eacute;d pigeonhole. Ms. Canyon self-published this autobiography. If a mainline publishing house distributed her work and marketed it as a roman a clef by an exciting new author, people who never heard of Christy would have made this the best seller it deserves to be. Canyon refused to compromise, refused censorship, and succeeded her way.The author, encouraged by her creative writing instructor, has written a lively narrative that will make you laugh and make you cry, while providing introspective on a remarkable life in an entertaining business. Her attention to detail, descriptive prose, prodigious memory, and well-researched vignettes coupled with fascinating flashbacks of the author's formative years make this much more compelling than just another star's life. It follows the author's brief but productive early career, her surprise departure from the adult business, and her first comeback. The author promises a follow-up about her life on the road dancing, but this deserves more than just one sequel. We look forward not only to her continuing story, but some advice books, some comedy, some romance novels and perhaps a screenplay. Turn on the reading lights, put down the camera, and focus on \\"Lights, Camera, Sex!\\""},{"Title":"Lights, Camera, Sex!","review":"I enjoyed this book. However if you're looking for dirty details, you won't find them here. Christy was careful not to burn any bridges (except Jethro maybe) which resulted in a somewhat censored feel to me."},{"Title":"Lights, Camera, Sex!","review":"Maybe all of us do have a story within us, or think portions of our lives would make a good read, but there are perhaps no stories as compelling out there as there are in the world of adult entertainment, or more bluntly referred to as \\"porn.\\" If said subject interests you, the market is indeed full of choices of adult film stars who have had other authors or ghost writers help them pen their memoirs. It is this readers humble opinion that there are NO better autobiographies out there than that of Christy Canyon. Her (handwritten!!) story, \\"Lights, Camera, Sex!\\" is not only an inside look at the rollercoaster of 80's and 90's porn, but a look inside her life so compelling, I often sat on the edge of my seat as my overactive imagination playing the scenes out in my head like a movie.Porn enthusiasts will discover much to keep them aroused here. Christy spares no expense dropping almost every name worth dropping in the 1980's, from Peter North, Ron Jeremy, Billy Dee, Ginger Lynn, and 80's scandal poster child (yes, CHILD) Traci Lords. The sex-shooting scenes are described so vividly and graphically no one would blame you for toweling off and grabbing some Subway after reading them. And then of course there is the other side of porn she shares with the good reader, which more than once may bring about a howl of laughter. Being a male who finds himself unable to perform in a scene, we learn, is a fate worse than death.But Christy's sexual on camera exploits are actually the side dish to this tale. The real story, we learn right from the start, is about Christy Canyon the young woman, who we get a glimpse of as a cute and innocent child in the first chapter. Her young life, told often in flashbacks when a memory is relevant to the story, is often moving and touching, without being a \\"victim\\" as so many other stars try to play themselves. I hung onto every word as Christy laid out her childhood with her Mother, Father, and sister, blushed a bit as she recalled the young age when she discovered Mother Nature had \\"big\\" plans for her, and literally ate the book like it was a sandwich during her climatic end to her life as secretary to her Father, which led to a triumphant return to porn.From sexual exploits, personal drama, and celebrity encounters, Christy Canyon treats the reader to a fun and erection inducing ride with flat out honesty and humor. I praise her for choosing to take the helm on this piece of literature as a personal project, and like many readers, wait in anxious anticipation for its sequel, which may or may not come. Sequel or not, I promise the reader one thing from this book : by the time you reach the final page you will come to the realization that the largest part of Christy Canyon's anatomy is not the pair of breasts that helped make her famous. It is her heart that is truly big, and she shares it with us in Lights, Camera, Sex! It may not even be fair to call it a story of porn. It's the story of a life. A life worth living."},{"Title":"Mysteries of the Crystal Skulls Revealed","review":"I love reading about crystal skulls and anyone who is interested in the subject I would highly recommend this book.

Best when paired against a more 'practical', physical examination of the skulls, for the sake of fact-checking and drama-reduction.

Author Stephen Cox quiets the cacophony of finger-pointing moralizers, who so confidently distinguish heroes from villains in this tragedy, with his careful and thoughtful analysis of the ethical paradoxes associated with the event. This impartial treatment and the annotated bibliography are worth the price of admission. But the real treat is the drama of the Titanic Story. Intertwined with the factual descriptions are excerpts from exciting eyewitness testimonies, taken primarily from the American and British inquiries after the disaster.

It has something to offer everyone interested in the story of the Titanic, whatever their familiarity with the facts.Everyone knows how the maiden voyage of the Titanic ended. It's so much a part of cultural literacy, Cox argues, that the real essence of the story -- the people who were involved and their complex choices -- has been lost. The Titanic Story offers an alternative interpretation of the event, courageously treating the victims of the disaster as people instead of moral archetypes, and showing how they, as individuals, were subject to the timeless challenges of being human.His argument is compelling. After reading the Titanic Story, one is likely to agree with Cox that the Titanic disaster not only deserves, but in fact needs, to be apprehended as a complex human drama. Viewing it this way re-establishes the individuality of the victims, and draws them off the drab, flat canvas that popular history has confined them to. Cox reminds us, through judiciously selected stories and interviews, that the choices of passengers and crew aboard the sinking Titanic were the result of difficult, mostly impromptu balances of facts, and that even apt foresight isn't always enough to avoid a moral (or literal) disaster.The Titanic Story is also easy to read, and it has a friendly, discursive tone that's a lot like listening to an unassuming person talk about a matter in which he is well-informed and thoughtful. It brings a literary interpretation to bear upon a serious historical event without getting maudlin or indulgent (he uses the stage metaphor in moderation); it is funny when it's appropriate to be funny; and what's more, it is convincing.Professor Cox's book is an important, unique addition to the corpus of Titanic literature."},{"Title":"The Titanic Story: Hard Choices, Dangerous Decisions","review":"Stephen Cox's THE TITANIC STORY is carefully researched, offering new insight into a fascinating story. More importantly, it is a delight to read: Cox is a brilliant writer."},{"Title":"The Titanic Story: Hard Choices, Dangerous Decisions","review":"When I began reading, I thought the subtitle should read &quot;Fair Play for Ismay&quot; or &quot;Don't Bash Poor Bruce.&quot; His only fault seems to be that he left his valet and secretary behind on the ship. Then I thought the purpose of the book was to ridicule government inquiries and regulations, since the author make much of belittling the &quot;lifeboats for all&quot; legislation; saying that had Titanic enough for all, it would not have helped since they could not launch the 20 they had. (If there was less belief in Titanic's unsinkability, I'm sure the 4 collapsible lifeboats would have been stored in less awkward places and so would've been launched before the ship sank. The belief was that Titanic was a &quot;Floating Lifeboat&quot;) Neither Lusitania or the Eastland were able to use their lifeboats because they sank so fast and Eastland capsized because it was overloaded with people on one side of it's deck. The ship owners suddenly cried &quot;boats for all&quot; because they did not want an outsider (i.e. the government) meddling with their monopolies and cozy old boys clubs; just like the movie moguls &quot;regulated&quot; themselves 10 years later. The wireless law was necessary because of the proliferation of mixed up messages that cause some newspapers to say &quot;All safe. Titanic towed to Halifax.&quot;; but Cox does not mention that. As to the survivor accounts, they appear to be there to pad the book. There was no new information and no insight as to why they decided to go or stay. It's ok reading because someone had to point out that Mr. Ismay was scapegoated. He should not have been given the wireless message (much less keep it in his pocket) if he was considered an ordinary passenger; but he was brave to have tried to help and to go in nearly the last boat, since he knew from Thomas Andrews just after the collision that the ship would sink. And he did feel some guilt that so many who put their faith in his company's ship had perished."},{"Title":"The Titanic Story: Hard Choices, Dangerous Decisions","review":"A crisp and engaging read, Cox offers up fresh perspectives on this oft-told maritime tale. A veritable life preserver amid the flotsam of current 'Titanic' literature, I heartily recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Titanic Story: Hard Choices, Dangerous Decisions","review":"It was hard for me to follow the direction in which the author was trying to lead the reader. From a literature professor, especially, I expected better structure and organisation: a set of assertions in the introduction that would lay out the overall theme of the book, a body of information to support those assertions, and a concise summary to cohere the information together into the theme described in the introduction. Instead, the author meandered from topic to topic, ending in an unexpected attack on Mr. Ismay and Senator Smith. I did not feel that the information presented was fully balanced, but instead supported only one side of the author's argument. I found a similar bias in the appendix, where the author gives his own interpretation of others' books on the subject. Not only did I find myself disagreeing with more than half of the author's opinions, I saw no reason for dissecting others' works in this book. There are some thought-provoking arguments sprinkled throughout the book and a reader knowledgeable with most of the aspects of the tragedy can evaluate them in a proper context."},{"Title":"The Titanic Story: Hard Choices, Dangerous Decisions","review":"If you had a clear-cut opinion about the Titanic tragedy, Stephen Cox will probably change that. This book not only disputes and destroys certain popular myths, but raises many questions that do not have definitive good answers. Though I would have liked more of the author's opinion, this book is a compelling discussion of the Titanic story."},{"Title":"The Titanic Story: Hard Choices, Dangerous Decisions","review":"As a teacher and lover of history, I have read nearly everything I can on this subject. This book is undoubtedly one of the worst I have encountered.The back cover is infuriating in its suggestion of providing a &quot;fresh take&quot; on the Titanic story. Worse, is the assertion that Stephen Cox refutes the &quot;popular myth&quot; (whatever that is) and shows that the &quot;true story is more interesting...and much more disturbing&quot;. Talk about literary spin! There isn't anything new in this book, infact most of it - the first person accounts -are transcribed word for word as they are in other books.Stephen Cox reads like a smug, know-it-all academic who sits in the safety of his ivory tower and waxes philosophic, dismissing a myriad of perspectives on the Titanic story as being without any value. Instead, he chooses to reduce the real-life persons involved to mere &quot;characters&quot; and likens the moment of the ship's sinking to be somehow a stage-set loaded with actors and actresses:&quot;These were all superb performances, whether they were meant to assist others or only, at last, to assert the actors' sense of themselves. Were they only performances? Perhaps. But if so, the roles selected were appropriate to a moral drama...&quot;Stephen Cox is a pedantic and condescending professor of literature; he is not a historian and this is blatantly obvious throughout. His supposed revolutionary ideas about the disaster come to very little, ie: even if there had been enough life boats, maybe they wouldn't have been utilized anyway given the situation. Maybe the captain of the Californian was a good guy after all...maybe &quot;women and children first&quot; is not a natural decision but rather a contrived moral position, blah blah blah.It all amounts to boring speculation that at times reads like the musings of bloated professional student. At times his writing style is bewilidering:&quot;This, it appears, was their difference from Captain Lord, who took account of every risk except the risk of being the kind of person who cares only about the risks.&quot;Enough said. This books stinks, and it's offensive to real historians; he speaks so scornfully about many of the witnesses and their recollections, that it reeks of insensitivity and self-righteousness."},{"Title":"The Encyclopedia of Soviet Spacecraft","review":"This hardcover book describes Soviet ( Russian ) hardware at its best.

Sadly, he was never that popular and most people probably don't know his works, excepting his Star Wars trilogy. Any of his books are good enough to be on the same shelf with The Lord of the Rings and Dune, and his style of writing has always appealed to me.In Jinx on a Terran Inheritance, this style is taken to the max. The humor and irony is there, and so is the action. This is also the longest of \\"The Trilogy\\" (for lack of a better name). Alacrity and Hobart are on their way to Blackguard, a planet infamous for its oppression of the weak and poor by the powerful, who made it into a theme park where they can play out fantasies such as being Lord of a medieval castle, etc. This is also where Hobart's inheritance, a ship called Astrea Imprimateur, is being held. With no idea where the ship is on the planet, or if it has fallen into an evil warlord's hands, they set out towards the planet with no funds, and no way to get there. Eventually, they get employed as breakabouts by a ship captain, and off they go. One of the funniest parts in any of the books is where they make a stop on a planet in the process of a funeral for the mayor of one of the cities or something like that. I won't give it away, but you'll get there soon enough....I don't think it's possible to dislike this book. Any fan of good sci-fi should get this, and anyone who calls himself/herself a fan of Brian Daley should already have it.Long live the Srillans!"},{"Title":"Jinx on a Terran Inheritance","review":"In this 2nd installment of the adventures of Hobart Floyt and Alacrity Fitzhugh, the reader is once again caught up immediately in sharing the trials and tribulations of the spacefaring duo.

The harried and hounded friends manage to survive one mishap after another, and gain vital information along the way, that makes the ending of this book absolutely riveting. Brian Daley is at his best with this book, his writing captivates the reader with vivid descriptions of the environment to the point you really feel you have &quot;been there&quot;, and the interaction of the two friends is such that it often seems as if these are people you really know.

I didn't mind to read any of this trilogy out of order; each book sets itself up strongly.What Daley created was a pair of great characters and some top-notch adventure sci-fi.

He also has a nice list of recommended readings, although it's only two pages."},{"Title":"Sex For Sale: Prostitution, Pornography, and the Sex Industry","review":"When I first saw this volume, I thought, \\"It's about time.\\" While we talk behind closed doors of the sex industry, we seldom discuss it openly except as a joke. At the same time, it appears to be growing! And we pretend that those involved in it are not really human beings, people, in fact, who are trying to make a living. As if they were prisoners, we sequester them and ignore them, pretend they don't exist, except when we need what they offer.Of course, I had some cynical suspicions. Was this the excuse that some sociologist came up with when his wife caught him? At least that suspicion was quickly abated.One cannot help but be fascinated by some people in the \\"sex industry.\\" Who are the people who answer the phones on the sex calls? Why do people get involved in making porn movies? The book covered some of that, how, for example, some of the women who do sex calls aren't as stupid as we'd like to think, how they even get some of their ideological points across while on their calls.Some of the text, however, I found to be silly. There was some that amounted to fairly boring and pretty meaningless statistics. Some of the rest of the text I found valuable. How many of the street prostitutes are crack or heroin addicts? How many are physically abused by their johns? And others I found offensive. There was an entire essay on a group in Oregon who ostensibly trains street prostitutes to get out of the business. That in itself is commendable. But they use \\"radical feminist ideology\\" that offends me. While, for example, the word \\"victim\\" has been shunned--replaced with more acceptable terms like \\"survivor\\"-- what the women are taught is still no less than their roles as victims. It's the Catherine McKinnon school of fem-rhetoric, that women who have sex are inherently victims--err, \\"survivors\\"--of the prevalent, powerful patriarchy, and on and on. And men are NOT victims of some of the same workplace politics? It leads me to believe that many of the feminists who proclaim this stuff have never really gone out and gotten a job.What's more, the author of that essay praised the project, despite its weaknesses, for its phenomenal success rate, which I read as somewhere substantially beneath 20 percent. That to me is far from success. Further, if it is success, the women who partake of it believe in the man vs. woman theology that keeps such \\"radical feminist\\" organizations in business. And that's at least sad.The chapter dealing with the brothel industry in Nevada is fascinating. Granted, there's a little feminist speculation (something of which I may be over-wary because I know the institution at which the editor teaches has a women's studies program--some graduates of which I know all too well--of dubious scholarly merit.) But one fact the chapter ignores has been obvious to me for years: among the reasons prostitution AND gambling are legal in Nevada is that the state is a desert! What else would they do there if you didn't have \\"industries\\" traditionally shunned elsewhere! Anyway, there were worthwhile observations and insights in the chapter, and I can't allow a few ideological squabbles to overshadow that.The final chapter went to United Kingdom for reasons I didn't understand. The writers were able to discuss with various English police departments their views toward prostitution. And many of them felt--as do lots of people, I suspect--that legalization of the practice should be seriously considered. It's \\"the world's oldest profession,\\" and despite regulations and the like, it ain't going away.Anyway, much of the book is a bit dry, rather statistical, a bit too pedantic. The subject matter is important, something we really should think about. I wish it had been just a smidgen more titillating, though to have been less serious would have invited the allegation that the writers weren't taking the subject seriously, were perhaps covering up their embarrassment over discussing it.So, despite its weaknesses, I'm glad it was written. Next step: get decision-and law-makers to read it and institute some changes."},{"Title":"Sex For Sale: Prostitution, Pornography, and the Sex Industry","review":"very informative book on sex work, takes the reformist approach which is very helpful to those seeking a new and more informed approach"},{"Title":"Sex For Sale: Prostitution, Pornography, and the Sex Industry","review":"the two reviews here are for the 1st edition of Sex For Sale (2000) NOT for the 2nd edition (2010) on this page."},{"Title":"Shoplifting","review":"I liked the book but, I found it lacking in useable details.

It is an excellent guide for those of us who are interested in caring for our own dead rather than handing them off to a funeral director."},{"Title":"Alison's Gift: The Song of a Thousand Hearts Opening","review":"Facing the unthinkable--the sudden death of a child--this thought lurks uncomfortably in the corners of my and every parent's mind. What is the big picture of life and death, destiny, the love and role of parent and child, family, and the friendship of others? Alison's Gift is the story of the sudden death of a child of a mother that could easily be in my own circle of friends. Beth Sanders, with the support of her friends and family, follows her own intuition about how to handle the physical, emotional, and spiritual details of the crossing of her child from this life into the next. I found myself fasciinated, touched, and, yet, strengthened by the telling of this story by author, Pat Hogan. The results were a sense of inner calm and that \\"unthinkable\\" feeling subsiding. This book has that ability to show the reader how to tread down a path that we all are unsure of. It is a book to read and pass around."},{"Title":"Alison's Gift: The Song of a Thousand Hearts Opening","review":"Alison was a delightful and loving little girl who lost her life all too soon.

We love Alison."},{"Title":"Alison's Gift: The Song of a Thousand Hearts Opening","review":"This story is the tragic account of the completely unneccessary death of a young child because of an airbag. I often found myself crying as the author spelled out some of the details of the ordeal that he and his family lived through as a result of that car accident. I found myself crying both for them and for me (because I, too, have suffered loss because of an airbag). I think that this book was probably a tremendous avenue for the author to deal with his grief, and I applaud his courage for doing so. At times, I found myself to be disturbed by the descriptions of some of the things that the family chose to do related to final arrangements for their daughter. Everyone, however, deals with grief and loss in his/her own way...and has the right to do so. Once again, courageous, but disturbing. Overall, a pretty well-written story - almost more of a journal,really. I found myself wanting more to be said about the dangers of airbags than was said. I realize, however, that the author's focus was honoring the loss of a child in his life....not &quot;righting the wrongs&quot; of the automotive industry. And in that, he did a good job."},{"Title":"Alison's Gift: The Song of a Thousand Hearts Opening","review":"Alison's Gift - The Song of a Thousand Hearts Opening - reads like a symphony, as the notes and chords tug at our heart-strings throughout the book, and as each \\"instrument\\" in the orchestra builds momentum adding layers of emotions and textures to an urgency . . . the urgency to unfold the true story of a child's life and death, and spiritual \\"resurrection\\". Alison's mother, Beth, embodies both the lioness mother protecting and fighting for her wounded young, and Mother Mary in Michelangelo's Pieta, as she courageously surrenders her broken heart to the acceptance of unnegotiable Death. Alison's father, Rob, suffers the tragedy by descending into a state of Inferno, where he heroically fights monsters with his aching soul and comes out with a gift of his own.Pat Hogan, as the narrator in this captivating book, leads the reader into a labyrinth of an unfathomable tragedy - a minor car accident, the explosive opening of an airbag, and the resulting loss of an innocent child. The miracle that rose from the tragedy is the transcendence over despair by a community of family, Christian Community priest, and school (teachers, parents and students alike), who together wove the golden thread that offered healing and redemption to the thousand hearts shattered. Bold, direct, and yet vulnerable, Hogan's writing trembles like earthquakes, stirring the reader's so-called calm, normal existence into inquiries beyond."},{"Title":"Alison's Gift: The Song of a Thousand Hearts Opening","review":"i think mr. hogan has done a wonderful job in spinning alison's tale. a very good read!"},{"Title":"Autobiography of Anthony Trollope (The Seaside library. Pocket edition)","review":"Unfairly the author was deemed a disgrace during his school days and he burns with indignation over his treatment fifty years later. At twelve he went from Harrow to Winchester. His father had taken two farms, had no capital, and had given up his career as a lawyer. After Winchester Trollope returned to Harrow.When his mother wrote a book about her stay in the United States, it was a success. The family's pecuniary circumstances improved, but the boy remained friendless. DOMESTIC MANNERS OF THE AMERICANS was the first of Mrs. Trollope's travel books. In her case politics was an affair of the heart.At Orley Farm the mother surrounded the family with moderate comforts. After two years the family decamped to Belgium to avoid creditors. Mrs. Trollope wrote novels while a son and her husband were dying of consumption. The author then hurried to London to assume a job at the Post Office. After the father's death, Mrs. Trollope moved back to England. The author's father had had a life of misery through no fault of his own, suffering a blighted ambition.Seven years later Anthony went to Ireland to work as a surveyor clerk for the Post Office. He met his wife there and married in 1844. In 1845 his first novel was finished. Two Irish novels and an historical novel were failures. He surveyed postal facilities in England and conceived of THE WARDEN story at Salisbury. It was begun in 1852. When it was published in 1855 there were notices of it in the press. It was not as great a failure as the others. He wrote BARCHESTER TOWERS in railway coaches as he traveled in them on Post Office business. The author's brother supplied the plot for DR. THORNE.To pursue his other career Trollope allotted himself so many pages a week. (This bit in the autobiography is famous.) He finished DR. THORNE on one day and started THE BERTRAMS the next. Trollope went to Egypt, to Scotland, to the West Indies for the Post Office. He created FRAMLEY PARSONAGE for CORNHILL MAGAZINE. John Everett Millais illustrated FRAMLEY PARSONAGE, THE SMALL HOUSE AT ALLINGTON, PHINEAS FINN, and RACHEL RAY.Anthony Trollope settled at Waltham Cross and in 1866 became a member of the Garrick Club and subsequently a number of other clubs. His comments on other novelists of the 19th century are interesting. He claims authors and critics should not be in the same company. In 1867 THE LAST CHRONICLE OF BARSET was brought out in monthly installments. That same year Trollope resigned from the Post Office. Evidently Anthony Trollope inherited his mother's stamina."},{"Title":"Spaces of Creation: The Creative Process of Playwriting","review":"The writer of a play, looking at the first blank piece of paper has to first create a world. It is a world that will exist only in the mind of the audience, but it is a world none the less. He has to start with some kind of image of the space he is creating along with the emotions that he has to make the audience feel. To do this the author must look at the conflicting ideas inside his head and bring them out to mere words on that piece of paper.Susan Zeder is the head of the playwriting program at the University of Texas at Austin. Jim Hancock is a teacher of acting and movement. Over many years they have jointly developed their approach to teaching acting. This book summarizes their efforts. It combines an array of psychophysical and theatrical approaches to playwriting that is unique.Following a series of short exercises, this book will enlighten and entertain while uncovering ways to invigorate your writing from within."},{"Title":"The Class (Dedalus European Classics)","review":"\\"The Class\\" is a good reading experience. It's always a bit of a stretch to read a work written over 75 years ago and in another language. Translator Mike Mitchell does a good job of creating the flow and pacing from the original German as it was originally published in 1927. Ungar was a popular novelist before World War II, often mentioned at the time with Kafka. The main character Josef Blau is a secondary schoolteacher at a boys' school. Apparently not all that comfortable as a teacher, he spends a good portion of his time in mental agony over his ability to maintain control of his students. His insecurity also extends to his beautiful wife Selma whom he suspects as having an affair with a blond schoolteacher Herr Leopold who exercises \\"naked\\" (i.e. no shirt) with his students. Blau & his wife have a young son born in the midst of the tale, which only heightens Blau's insecurity. When word arrives that one of his students has bought a note which would make the poor teacher indebted to the rich student, Blau's insecurities mushroom resulting in the unfolding of events including his wife shaving her head to show that she is not trying to attract other men. Ungar gives us the flavor of a time when opportunities were limited and people struggled for the little they had. He also delves into some heady theological discussions on the existence of God, which actually has a unifying effect as the tale concludes. I found \\"The Class\\" a somewhat difficult although an ultimately rewarding reading experience. Ungar's novel does stand the test of time and does speak to us seven decades after it was written. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Class (Dedalus European Classics)","review":"Have you ever wanted to get inside a self-tormented, paranoid, and obsessive-compulsive mind? Josef Blau is the kind of neurotic specimen approaching a mental break down that makes for morbidly compelling reading.Set in the 1920s, Hermann Ungar's dark and melancholy novel is a psychological thriller focused on Blau's precarious mental state. He is a schoolteacher at a wealthy high school who suspects his class of boys are conspiring against him. Blau's preemptive strike and classroom philosophy is strict discipline and order. Even the manner in which he sits down at his desk is highly controlled, on account that Blau fears turning his back to the boys at any point will break his authoritarian hold over them. Blau is the epitome of insecurity, which is intensified by his lower class upbringing and intense jealousy of his beautiful pregnant wife.The cast of characters are small and while they behave realistically, Ungar clouds their motivations in ambiguity. As I was reading, I didn't know if Blau's suspicions were completely unfounded or clairvoyant of the truth. Indeed, this novel favors psychological suspense over intricate plot points. Most of the writing explores Blau's disturbed mind, paranoias, and delusions. I must say Ungar writes with authentic insight into the troubled mind. The reader experiences in detail all of Blau's obsessive thoughts, exaggerated fears, self-afflicted guilt, and far-fetched justifications for his behavior. As a result, every scene contains a level of tension, whether it's Blau's routine at school, his interactions with family and acquaintances, or his agitated and distant relationship with his wife.Remarkably and to my disappointment, this novel is not a tragedy and does not push the protagonist over the edge as I would have liked. There is one tragic event that puts Blau on a self-destructive path, but Ungar ultimately delivers an optimistic finale.Bottom line: Unlike Ungar's earlier novelThe Maimed(1923), there is very little violence, perversity, or decadent flavor in \\"The Class\\" - it's more like expressionism lite. Nevertheless, it is a fascinating read for those interested in psychological torment, guilt, and brooding madness."},{"Title":"The Class (Dedalus European Classics)","review":"Joseph Blau has an infriroity complex and maintains a rigid regime to keep his world in order. He is convinced his class hate him and want to destroy him and lives in fear believing that every word, every thought has a consequence that is linked to fate.This isn't a comfortable read and you find it hard to sympathise with Blau at times, but Ungar gets into the mind of a madman and the whole story is seen from that viewpoint.'The Class' is very much of its age;ie between the wars bohemia in thinking style and philosophy. To me this is what makes it a curio of interest. The first World War effectively ended Regal rule-it was part of the class war that had raged in Europe since the French Revolution,and between it and WW2 (the next great realignment of power war) a lot of avante garde work was produced of which this is one. Blau is haunted by his own station in life and that of his superiors."},{"Title":"The Emperor Who Ate the Bible: And More Strange Facts and Useless Information","review":"This is an excellent book.

The most famous is \\"A Christmas Carol.\\" Most of us are familiar with this story from Mr. Magoo, Disney or whomever. It is refreshing to read the original story that spawned the plays and the movies. Sometimes the between book and the movie, one disappoints. The book does not fail here.The other two stories are less well known, \\"The Cricket on the Hearth\\" and \\"The Chimes.\\" I will not spoil the stories by revealing the plots, but I will say that \\"The Chimes\\" is a New Year's story.Dickens is a legendary storyteller and his skill shines through in these stories. This is a good seasonal reading. Start just before Christmas and end, with \\"The Chimes\\" on New Year's Eve. Happy Holidays!"},{"Title":"With Fire and Sword, Vol. 2: A Tale of the Past","review":"If you are a fan of historic epics with a whirlwind plot, tons of bloody battle scenes, dueling lovers and fascinating characters then \\"With Fire and Sword\\" is ideal for you. This is the first part of the renowned Trilogy written by Nobel Prize winning novelist Henryk Sienkiewicz. The novel is a story of a romance between an officer and a young woman. The story is intertwined with the bloody peasant rebellions and Tatar wars which took place in eastern Poland in the 17th century. Sienkiewicz's main credit is the degree of depth which he bestows upon his characters. The characters are full packages of human emotion, desires, fears hate and paradoxes. Personally I vote for Zagloba as my favorite. The historic detail with which the book is written provides the audience an opportunity to witness the events in the eye of their mind. As he does with the characters, Sienkiewicz goes into great detail in describing the surroundings such as the interiors of the castles or battle scenes. The novel is not gory simply for shock effect, the author portrays the battles of the 17th century with brutal honesty. I've read the original Polish version as well as the English and found that the translated edition is very true to the original. The only flaw with the version available is the lack of illustrations, which would be useful for the novice reader."},{"Title":"With Fire and Sword, Vol. 2: A Tale of the Past","review":"This is a fantastic book that comes highly recommended, as you will see by reading the full set of 40+ reviews. There are about 3 Ukrainian-Americans, however, who have gone through every review and panned it out of ethnic axe grinding. A shame. Whatever you view on its historical accuracy (it's a novel folks), the values of true honor the book endorses are universal, and the story is a page turner with well-developed characters. Those people who wrote the reviews were highly motivated to write them by the book's excellence.And as for the historical perspective, the fact is that the Polish rule of Ukraine, however harsh by Polish magnates such as those that Sienkiewicz describes, was nothing compared with the bloody repression of Ukrainian culture and language by the Czars. And the Soviet Union destroyed virtually all of Ukraine's religious traditions and starved and executed millions of its people under Stalin. For this the people of the Ukraine can thank Hymelnitsky, who by destroying the unity of the Commonwealth opened the door to the tragic rule of Ukraine by Muscovy. In the end, Sienkiewicz's view of history is vindicated."},{"Title":"With Fire and Sword, Vol. 2: A Tale of the Past","review":"The first volume gives a powerful image of Medieval Poland and of the permanent strife between different ethnic groups in this part of Europe. Willing to liberate themselves from the Polish rule, the Ukrainian Kosaks ally with the Tartars of the Golden Horde against their masters. Taken by surprise by the force of the uprising, the Pollons are thoroughly beaten - but their spirit never broken, despite being forced to retire over and over again, they will dug in at Zbaraz and wait for the royal troups.The young colonel Skrzetuski has completely renounced the hope to find his lover Helena alive - even more, he dreads finding her alive, for she'd certainly be raped and abused. This her lover thinks unsupportable (remember, this is a highly Catholic country, and the morals are very strict). Embittered and hopeless, he's waiting for his death at Zbaraz, for the king has no knowledge of his men peril and no one can go through the Tartar and Kosak siege lines. Famine and disease soon enter the city and the last defenders are reduced to praying for merciful death instead of a life of slavery.Unknown to Skrzetuski, pan Zagloba - one who never does much if he can help it, but manages to be highly praised even for doing nothing - has learned of Helena's whereabouts. Even if he's scared to death of her captor, Bohun, Zagloba has grown to love the young woman as a father, and will face the greatest perils for her sake. He finds her again and takes her to join the queen's ladies of honor. Fearing Skrzetuski's sanity of mind if the girl would be lost again through some twist of fate, his friends keep all news of her secret from him... even if the young man's pain reaches out to all of them.One last hope remains for the defenders of Zbaraz: if one man could break through the siege lines and carry a message to the king, the Pollon army could get there in time to save them. As the first one to volunteer is killed by the Tartars, Skrzetuski grabs the chance of a rapid death instead of starvation and offers to break through to the king... Too late his friends realise that knowing Helena is alive could've stopped him... Completely devoted to his honor, after giving his word to try to escape alive, Skrzetuski faces indescribable horrors and disappears for days - ill, dying, and starving - from the face of the earth - managing to reach the king and deliver his message. He's only half-healed when the siege of Zbaraz is lifted by agreement and his friends join him as he finally meets Helena again.The Kosak uprising lost a lot of force due to internal battling and with the leaving of the hordes (satisfed with the gold they'd gathered), the Pollons managed to turn the fate of the war. Even if not all the historical facts are accurate, this is great literature and a picture in words of a half-savage world struggling towards real civilisation.This is only the first in the historical trilogy (even if they can be actually read apart, and manage different time settings)that also includes \\"The Deluge\\" (possibly THE best historical novel written to date) and \\"Pan Michael\\". If you want to know what good, strong literature feels like, you won't miss this one. Get them both - get the whole trilogy.

And the way the story depicts the fulfillment of end-times prophecy will have you convinced that the author's got that nailed too."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"James BeauSeigneur may be an experienced politician and diplomat, and after reading from the reviews here, people seemed to think he's also a great storyteller. So when reading the book, I was surprised at his inability to write an interesting story. Here, he has come up with a pretty good idea, the cloning of Jesus, and turned it into a very boring book. It starts out okay with the Turin expedition and the cloning and later, Decker's kidnapping in Lebanon. After that it's just endless descriptions of political and diplomatic dealings of the United Nations, which gets boring after a few pages and lasts throughout the rest of the book. And the story is extremely choppy as a result of constant jumps in time. It's two decades earlier, ten years later, three months later, seven years later, three years later, twelve years later, etc. Every time it seems like something is about to happen, the chapter ends and the next chapter starts weeks or years later. As a result of this, you never get to know the characters so you never care for them.After the first few chapters, I thought perhaps I would read the whole trilogy, but after finishing this first book I don't feel like wasting any more time or money on it."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"If you're like me, you've read the Left Behind books with considerable pleasure. And, most importantly, you've been LEFT WANTING MORE. Well, I'm here to tell you that MORE is here, right now, with In His Image, book 1 of The Christ Clone Trilogy.Say you're at your favorite restaurant and you order your favorite starter dish--escargot, smoked salmon, beluga caviar, it doesn't matter. You're savoring the delicate, delicious flavors, BUT NOW YOU'RE READY FOR THE MAIN COURSE. What if that was all the food you got? Wouldn't you be disappointed? I know I would. That's what it's been like for us who're Left Behind fans. As we've gone through the series, we've encountered an endless string of appetizers--good, as far as they go--but not really totally satisfying.Listen. Your problems are over. If you're at all like me, you'll DEVOUR In His Image--probably at one or two sittings. And the great thing is, books 2 and 3 just keep getting better and better. And you'll get up from your easy chair COMPLETELY SATISFIED. At least that's how I see it."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"Regardless of genre, this is one of the best series of books I've ever read. You 'live' these books as you read them. It is almost too believable. The author's talent for blending in fact (backed up by footnotes) require you to keep reminding yourself that you are reading a work of fiction. These are exceptional books!"},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"The premise here is great. Seriously, this is the perfect formula for a Christian Fiction novel. I don't read many of the genre, because a lot of times they're either extremely preachy (I'm already a Christian, so I know the deal) or just boring. This one had nowhere to go but up, the author just... isn't very good. His prose is extraordinarily bland. Like what would result if Stephen King were struck on the head by a large board. He obviously never heard the old adage of \\"show, don't tell\\" as the book (well, what I could read of it before I got bored) does almost nothing but tell. When I came upon what should have been an exciting, dramatic moment but was just a bland telling of basic actions, I knew I was done. I do a bit of writing myself, and enjoy it quite a lot. I'm by no means an expert, and have nothing published. But I firmly believe that if I had the basic knowledge and research on the subjects discussed within the book, I could write it to be much better."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"The idea of having Jesus cloned is a compelling theme for any story. I have read some of them, and they are quite original. One book had Jesus cloned as a female!BeauSeigneur's story lacks interest. The characters are just a little too shallow, the beginning is full of \\"convenient coincidences,\\" and I thought these coincidences were just used to get the story started. But just when the story gains momentum, there is a gap. Then another, and in every other chapter, there are gaps everywhere. There's nothing better than a story with a sound continuity and a structured development.Then the story takes place in the UN, and it just becomes monotonous. It was around here when I gave up.The dialogs are too contrived, forced, and contributes very little to the story.But not all of it is bad. Loved Rosen and his theory of the Covenant and loved also the footnotes.BeauSeigneur researched this topic very well, but he just can't write a novel.I recommend \\"Divine Blood\\" by Martinez Helwett or \\"The Miracle Strain\\" by Michael Cordy"},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"I had gone to the library to find smething to read. I picked an aisle and went looking. All three books of the series were there so I checked them out. It was a good thing that the person I was training knew enough to let me just sit and answer some questions as I couldn't put the books down. I'd read most of the day at work, then go home and read till 12:30 or so (I am usually asleep by 10, I love my sleep). I liked the portrayal of Christopher as he is what I would expect of the anti-Christ. Very deceptive, likeable and blames everything on Yahweh. I was a bit scared in book two as Mr. Beauseigneur was making New Age appealing, as it very well may be after the rapture, but the truth was revealed in book three. I loved the coming of Jesus and his tears for the lost. Wonderful read."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"Clearly many people love this book so I am not going to denigrate their opinions.However, this book is very poorly written. The characters are extremely two-dimensional and the dialogue is weak. The author is not a good writer. What he does have, however, is a great imagination. I liked the story of this book and thought the hook (ie. Jesus cloned from the Shroud of Turin) was enticing.I think you would have to be a lover of Christian fiction to be blown away by this book. If you are not, this is an average thriller and not \\"edge of your seat\\" stuff. I am not feeling inclined to read the rest of the series and I feel slightly suckered that I bought this book based on the glowing reviews which are found everywhere else, it seems, on Amazon.com."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"The sheer volume of research and the magnitude and breadth of the story's scope are impressive, and the plot devices and twists are creative and entertaining. Surely, the premise has been done before but perhaps never as ambitiously or completely discussed since the Greatest Story Ever Told. It's just that BeauSeigneur isn't a fiction writer, really. His characters lack depth, his dialogue is contrived and lacks a normal conversational flow present in much better writers. I keep thinking as I read this, that if BeauSeigneur just plopped his notes and research on Stephen King's lap and said, &quot;make this work&quot;, we'd have three (or if you know King, six) marvelous books of well-written prose *and* some really creative twists. It's certainly far-reaching in its scope, but I don't think this former speechwriter was up to the task of writing it down. Given the other reviews, I'd say my opinion is unpopular, but I'd do readers a disservice by offering fake praise."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"I'm 57. In my entire life, I've only read six novels from cover to cover and they were all less than 250 pages. I'm a skimmer, not a reader. I couldn't even bring myself to read the &quot;Left Behind&quot; series. But a friend of mine strongly urged me to at least page through The Christ Clone Trilogy. Once I started, I found myself reading almost non-stop and finishing the third book less than three weeks later. BeauSeigneur has changed many of my views about the return of Christ."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"As the first book in a trilogy, &quot;In His Image&quot; sets the stage for the two books that follow. An intriguing plot, and well-developed characters combined with pain-staking research combine to make this perhapse the finest End-Times novel. This book (as do the others in the trilogy) reads like a mystery, a techno-thriller, and a science fiction novel all rolled into one. I'd give it five stars except for the mild profanity. You'll probably want to think twice before using the Christ Clone Trilogy in a Bible study."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"I enjoyed the book and I thought the concept was interesting but I did find myself wincing a little at the language. I tend to read all books of all kinds, but when I read a &quot;Christian&quot; book, I don't expect to find bad language. I read Christian books because I want to be edified spiritually, grow in the knowledge of the Lord and hopefully come away from the book a little wiser, even with fiction. I just want others to be aware of what it contains. I may still move on to the second in the series."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"I am very pleased to have read this book. I have read all the left behind books myself and found this to be just as good. Kinda spooky at times. If you like the left behind series than you should really get this also. The second book really keeps you on your toes."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"I bought this book because many of the reviews I've read here at Amazon have mentioned the Christ Clone Trilogy as being as good as We All Fall Down, by Brian Caldwell. I was skeptical, simply because Caldwell's novel is such a singularly extraordinary novel and as a whole, the genre is pretty poor when it comes to quality. Still, I gave it a try and my only regret is that I didn't order all three novels at once, and have to wait for the next two to find out what Beausinger has planned next. This novel is actually very diffirent from Caldwell's, but the quality is very much the same. Beausinger is a real pro when it comes to writing ability. He creates a truly believable endtimes scenario and really draws the reader in. This is a great novel."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"Seemingly prophetic stories of &quot;biblical&quot; proportions are trendy in the science fiction genre. With the 'Left Behind' series far ahead of many of them, you would hope people are reading these books for entertainment value and not &quot;biblical&quot; fact. One more to add is James BeauSeigneur's trilogy &quot;The Christ Clone Trilogy&quot;, with the first one here, 'In His Image'. The Story of the Shroud of Turin and the possibility that its either of Jesus, the one we know from Nazareth some 2000 years ago, or of a Knights Templar a little later in time. According to the carbon 14 dating, the Shroud enters a later period than that of Jesus Christ. But the snag here is there is some blood, a small minute drop that appears to be still living. So who's blood is it? A scientist decides to find out for himself and make a clone of the blood, and thus you have the beginnings of our story. Christopher is the product of that blood (Christ - Christopher). BeauSeigneur was a former intelligence analyst technical manuals for the military, and decided to take a swing at writing fiction. His background is fitting for the worldly affairs that take place within the political arena, however, his spiritual verse needs some discipline. While the story moves quite rapidly (time jumps in decades at a chapter), his writing does not have any life in it. Especially in the beginning of the novel which might read like some of his technical military manuals, referring to the Bible on end, DNA authorities like Francis Crick, along with the literature written on the Shroud of Turin. As the story moves past the &quot;historically&quot; accurate (speculatively interesting), and takes place in the possible future, our humble writer loses his grip on technicalities and focuses on the aim of the story. There is a lot of political jargon, so it may help to be familiar with world politics. I felt the characters were drawn two-dimensional, and the dialogue overall was flat. The book stands at 4 stars because of its informative and speculative factor as well as the main thrust of the story which is one of the better end-time stories I have come across. I look forward to reading the following sequels."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"After reading the Left Behind books, I thought I had been cheated. Those books started out well and ended very badly. The Christ Clone books are completely different. They are well-written, believable, and truly inspiring for a Christian. I did not understand why someone would follow the Antichrist in the Left Behind series, but Christopher hit a nerve so real that it is terrifying. I would encourage anyone to read these books."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"This book is incredibly well thought out though the one knock I would have is that I think the characters could use just a little more depth. That said this book brings up many thought provoking subjects. I would suggest this for anyone who is a fan of great science fiction. And as a Christian I would encourage anyone who starts this book to just keep reading as the book will hit on some sensitive topics but the payoff is worth it."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"I first read the original editions of these books years ago, after much debate. I've been wanting to read them again and the expanded editions do not disappoint.James' interpretation of prophesy fulfillment is very different that what I have read in other apocalyptic books and yet extremely believable. The story brings our own recent history into play and helps to envision one way the Tribulation may play out.The footnotes are a great source for biblical references and the author's explanations for for certain story points. Don't let the title turn you away as I almost did. These books should be be a standard in everyone's apocalyptic collections. Believers and non-believers alike will enjoy these books."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"Many, many years ago, while I was still a practicing Christian and a deep fundamentalist, I read the books \\"666\\" and \\"1000\\" by Salem Kirban. Christian fiction to me at that time was a novelty and I dove into the books. Long story short, they were so bad, I was embarassed for the man who wrote them and embarassed for my church and the people who thought they were \\"good\\" books.I have since rejected Fundamentalism with its inhuman belief in Hell, though I still cling to my faith. So recently I read the \\"Left Behind\\" series which everyone near me was raving about and came away with almost the same embarssment that I had when I read Salem Kirban. These are NOT \\"good\\" books, people. They're terribly written, with poor characterization and grammar school... grammar!Then I read this book because the premise seemd very interesting. A clone of Jesus?!? I'll bite! I was a bit hesitant because of all my previous encounters with Christian fiction (Those two I mentioned were not the only ones by the way. They were the first and the most popular, in that order.) So I ordered the book from Amazon and waited......and Oh he comes so close. The author is, without doubt, a good writer. There are instances in the book that are simply astounding and keep you riveted and turning the pages. I loved his take on the Rapture (an idea I had floated by my pastor back in the day only to have it slapped back at me) and his style of telling the story from the point of view of the antagonist is, while becoming a cliche in the fiction circle, a stroke of genius in the arena of Christian fiction.His characters are interesting and well developed but they're all left incomplete. As soon as you start to care about a character they pretty much disappear. My main gripe with his writing however, is his irritating habit of leading you to the edge of a cliff and then... \\"SIXTEEN MONTHS LATER.\\"This happens repeatedly throughout the book and made me want to tear my hair out. If you don't know why this would be infuriating, read this book and find out. If he could fix this glitch in his style I'm sure he could be a very convincing writer.So while the storytelling is not embarassingly bad it still falls short of good storytelling and I'm left still waiting for a truly \\"good\\" Christian fiction book. I would recommend the book but with all those caveats in mind."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"I bought this book because it was recommended along with the Left Behind series. Buyer beware: if you are looking for an end-times story that is solidly based on biblical prophecy, this is not the book for you. The author takes certain biblical references out of context and weaves them into his own New Age interpretation of &quot;all roads leading to God&quot;. He even blatantly makes up lies that seekers who aren't familiar with the Bible might swallow. For example, he says that the apostle John was the true betrayer of Christ, not Judas. I would hate to see anyone be led astray by the theology in this book. If you enjoy Bible-based reading, stick with the Left Behind series."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"And that's not saying much. The only reason I'm comparing this book to Dianetics is that it employes much the same marketing methods. Throw enough recommendations out there and some poor sap is sure to bite. Though I find it hard to believe that the author actually has the time to recommend this book everywhere on amazon, I find it easy to believe that misguided lunatics trying to save everyone from themselves may have the time."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"This was a great surprise after reading a couple of the LeftBehind books (one of which, from the kids' series [believed] that those &quot;left behind&quot;were not &quot;true&quot; christians). Christ Clone is FAR more intelligent, better written, and closer to the truth than Left Behind, with its comically literal approach to Revelation and its smug attitude toward anything secular. Christ Clone was suspenseful, gripping and great fun. This series and Place of the Lion by Charles Williams are my favorite Christian-themed books.Burn your Left Behind books and read Christ Clone. Jesus will approve :)"},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"Mix one part historical fact, add science, mix in Scriptures, toss in some not very credible science fiction, bake in a New Age oven, cool with religious speculation, and ice with geopolitics in future scenarios. Voila! You have this most unusual book. I have never read anything like it. If you are like me, you will find yourself drawn to the unusual plot and combination of story origins. On the other hand, you may find the characters to be underdeveloped, the emphasis on warfare and political intrigue excessive, and the plot too disconnected from likely events to be credible. I suspect that you will find reading this book a rewarding experience, for changing your ideas about now a novel can be constructed. If I were only grading this novel for originality, I would suggest that it was worth more than five stars.The book opens with a journalist accidentally finding a way to be part of the scientific team that plans to examine the Shroud of Turin, the linen that many believe was used to cover the body of Christ after His death. The story closely follows the actual scientific investigations into that relic, and includes many footnotes to the actual news reports.The flight of fancy begins when a scientist discovers some cells that can be used to clone other cells, and a person. The references here are well beyond anything that science was able to do in the timeframe described here, so you just have to play along. If you like your science fiction to be literal, you will probably be disappointed in this section.The story then evolves around a person being grown from these cells. Here again, science fiction takes many unlikely turns. For example, there is a theory that a clone can remember experiences that occurred in the original's body.Around this plot revolves helpful people in the background who seem to be playing the role of prophets, religious conflict that turns into terrorism and warfare, and a changing role for the United Nations. Of these themes, I found the one involving the United Nations to be quite interesting. If that body were to become more effective, how would it have to change from its current make-up and governance? You will find the author's answers to be quite useful, I think.The story is fast-paced, cutting quickly from one story line to the next. I found myself sitting up late to finish it.As you are aware, I'm sure, having lots of action means giving up other things. In this case, having lots of characters and plot complications means that you do not spend much time with any characters but two. Only one of these seems to get decent development. The other one is deliberately kept as a mystery. Since I love character development, that made the plot less interesting for me. If you like action, it will make the plot more interesting for you.This book is the first in a series called &quot;The Christ Clone Trilogy.&quot; From that title you can see that the story will probably parallel the life of Jesus in important ways, but there is less of that than you might imagine. In fact, if the book had hewn closer to a Christian theme, I suspect that I would have enjoyed it more. On the other hand, by not doing so, this book will be more accessible and appealing to people of all faiths and beliefs. So it is very democratic in that way.You should be aware that the book leaves you hanging, like an old Saturday morning cartoon serial just before the cereal commercial. If you decide to read this one, I suspect that you will feel compelled to read the rest of the series. I have not yet read them, but I must admit that I am curious about what comes next.There is a serious side to the book in that it realistically portrays the dangers of proliferating weapons of mass destruction. Anyone who reads this book will end up thinking quite a lot about what needs to be done to make the world a more humane and less dangerous place. That's a very worthwhile lesson to get from an action novel.What can you do to help with the issues of making this a better world for every one in it?Live with love and hope in your heart, and share them with all you meet!"},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"This is not a bad series, but I think perhaps I was going into it expecting too much. The reviews here have been so strong and so overwhelmingly positive that I was expecting a masterpiece. I didn't get it. The only two End Times novels I've ever read before this was Left Behind and We All Fall Down. This is certainly better than Left Behind (To be fair, I've only read the first one)but doesn't come anywhere near the quality of We all Fall Down. I baught all three books at one time and wished that I hadn't. This is a facinating premise, but that's all. There's no real exploration of Christian life and I certainly don't feel like I have a better understanding of my faith. This certainly didn't illuminate me or help me in that area. The characters are also fairly unengaging. Again, this is quite a bit better than Left Behind, but that's not really saying much. Perhaps if you read it with lowered expectations you will enjoy it more than I did."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"This is a book about the end of the world. Although it never tells you that. There is no need to because it is written so well. This is a book written for smart people. This is directed toward the general masses and not just Christians. You do have to have some knowledge of the book of Revelation in the Bible to understand the subtleties.The writing in this book is just superb, real top-notch. The characters and story are very well developed. You really feel like you are a part of that character as you basically watch him grow up. This is a fast paced book that spans decades. Some revelations in this story are just chilling (i.e. the pregnancy).&quot;Left Behind&quot;, another book about the end, is good, but &quot;The Christ Clone Trilogy&quot; is the definition of an &quot;end-times&quot; books. This makes you think without throwing anything at you. The research on this book is incredible, it even has footnotes! After reading this book you will realize that you have to get the next two. It really is just that good."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"overall, i thoroughly enjoyed In His Image, and purchased the 2 sequels prior to finishing it. what kept me from rating it &#34;5 stars&#34; was one very glaring ommision----&#62;where was the internet in this book?i found it absolutely preposterous that decker and christopher had never heard of the KDP prior to arriving in israel. if, in fact, 144,000 psychic people were running around the middle east with red letters stamped on their foreheads, one wouldn't need a cabbie's explanation as to the who/what/when/where/why of it all! in reality, the internet would have been abuzz with such news; throughout the book, i consistently marvelled that the main characters neither mentioned nor used a tool that most of us use daily. wierd!"},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"The strength of this novel is a very inventive plot that keeps you intrigued. To me, it's different with a little more depth than the Left Behind series. If you want a novel to share with your unchurched friends that presents Christ in a subtle but powerful way, check out The Gravel Drive by Kirk Martin. thegraveldrive.com has excerpts. If you want a fascinating read with which to escape, so to speak, check out In His Image. It won't disappoint."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"I bought two books from Amazon, BeauSeigneur's IN HIS IMAGE and A.T. Nicholas' THE FIST OF GOD. I could hardly finish IN HIS IMAGE. I'll buy the next one in hopes of improvement. But I was greatly pleased with THE FIST OF GOD. The story was moving and interesting, and the plot was well done. It could have been better,but not bad for a first novel. There's too much cussing and violence in this book for some, but I can overlook it for the better of the message. There's a great message for all of us in Nicholas' novel. Read it. IN HIS IMAGE was OK, looking for better work on number two. The Fist of God a solid (three and a half star). Can't wait for his next attempt."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"This is a zerox of the \\"left behind\\" books. And for that matter of every other doom and gloom end of the world book. Except the difference between those and this is that this one is badly written. It has a ton of editing mistakes. I can't believe the publisher let them slip. But when I say it's badly written I'm not talking about poor grammar. I'm talking about a horribly mismatched story that is that disappoints. The dialogue is horrible. Kind of like the dialogue in \\"Attack of The Clones\\". Ugh. I struggled through this baby hoping it would get better and getting ever more disappointed. I don't think this author should quit his day job. I don't recommend it."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"Best Premise since &quot;DRIVEN&quot;, by W. G.

By waiting, I missed Amzaon's return period. I am a HUGE fan of the Left Behind series. I have the originial versions in print and I recently bought all the updated electronic versions. Once I finished Left Behind again, I wanted something similiar and I saw alot of reviews on The Christ Clone TrilogyWith that being said, I couldn't get past the first couple chapters. The plot seemed like it could be interesting but it wasn't. I actually started getting a headache while reading. May be for some, but it wasn't for me."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"I had no idea when I picked up this series that there was anyone as entirely brilliant as James BeauSeigneur writing in this genre. The way in which he weaves his apocalypse is as elegant as it is amazing. Beginning his story with historical events, BeauSeigneur brings his reader along ever so gently into a world of incredible fiction that he makes entirely credible. BeauSeigneur's use of footnotes was at first a bit unsettling but I came to realize the author was less interested in pulling me into his fictional world and far more interested in invading my real world and turning it on its head. I can honestly say that never has my waking life been more disturbed by a work of fiction. BeauSeigneur is a master."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"In my frustration and annoyance at the disturbing popularity of the Left Behind rags, I was interested in the many strong opinions I read on the Christ Clone Trilogy. I had seen so many positive comments on BeauSeigneur's series that I wen tout and bought the first of the trilogy.I must say, this is indeed the best end-times book I have read; however, seeing as how I have read so very little of them, this is not saying much. The story was interesting, but not consistently. I was gripped by the Shroud of Turin stuff and the neat theories behind the Ark of the Covenant...I love that stuff, so the beginning really had me. But the book did not keep my interest; moreover there were some major issues that I had with the books.First, the Clone himself. I'm not a history revisionist by any stretch, but it seems to me that if Christ were cloned, then this person would look like a first century Jew - a darker skinned person. Well, the Clone in this book was ablr to pass himself off as a white person (the nephew of a scientist) and was clearly thought to be of European stock! While BeauSeigneur seemed to want to be as accurate as possible by all the &quot;footnotes&quot; he has (most of which were just Bible quotes), he was clearly lacking in this regard.Second, I'll set aside the whole bad theology of the rapture; I'll rant about that elsewhere. Let's assume that it's good theology (which it isn't!). Now I was intrigued by BeauSeigneur's way of handling it - VERY different from other renderings of this event. BUT - don't you think the world would have made a correlation between all the people who left in the &quot;Disaster&quot; with the fact that they were all Christian? That was a major hole to me. There was not even an attempt to pretend at a reason why all these people are gone - they just refer to it as the Disaster.Third, I did not like the treatment of Jewish theology. BeauSeigneur may be right that Jews are not allowed to predict the coming of the Messiah in Daniel, and perhaps they almost never read Isaiah 53, but I really doubt it. In fact, I have read numerous sites on the Web where Jews have given their own perspective on this prophecy. As a Christian, I may disagree with their translation, but I do not claim that they are as ignorant as BeauSeigneur implies.These are the major problems that kept staring me in the face. That's not to say it was not an interesting book. I would like to read the rest of the series, but I don't really feel like paying for the other two books! I will grant that BeauSeigneur delved into more speculative and fantastic ideas; I don't think that he sees this entirely as the way it WILL happen as the LEFT behind authors do."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":". . . So the author of this book and all his insipid religious fanatic fans will be transported to a place where they can no longer bother thinking people with this ridiculous tripe. I too fell for the &quot;customer recommended&quot; scheme. Christian? Maybe. Hypocrite? Definitely."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"My reviews are not as eloquent or verbose as some, so I will say simply, READ this book and the following volumes. While some may not appreciate the worldly way the scenario is presented or JBS's interpretation of Biblical prophesy, I can testify to the fact that the conflicting emotions evoked thru the reading are strengthening and valuable to those of us who look at the news and follow the shifting emphasis in the markets to Technology and Bio-Technology every day. Along with the Gilbert Morris OMEGA TRILOGY books, IN HIS IMAGE:Book one of THE CHRIST CLONE TRILOGY and the subsequent works by James BeauSeigneur dull the impact of the LEFT BEHIND series. DO not despair Jenkins-LaHay fans. All books that reflect the truth of the GOOD BOOK are good books ."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"James Beauseigneur's Christ Clone trilogy could have been SO good! The plot is intriguing, but author's need to use every &quot;end-time&quot; prophecy was distracting and weak. Also, the stupidity of the characters, both named and un-named, takes away from the plausibility of the storyline. For example, when &quot;millions&quot; of people in all parts of the world mysteriously die all at the same time, bio-terrorism is assumed to be the cause - NO ONE suggests the possibility of &quot;Rapture&quot; even after no cause is found. Please! I can't believe that someone, somewhere wouldn't start shouting &quot;The end of the world is near&quot; at this point! I cancelled my order for the 2 sequels as soon as I turned the last page of the novel, which I had to force myself to finish!"},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"I had ordered all three of the Trilogy books, but cancelled my order for 2 & 3 after reading the first one. BeauSeigneur started a lot of interesting stories -- like the mysterious disappearance of about a quarter of the World's population, the cloning of Christ, the life of a news photographer and struggles of Israel to be independent, then got bogged down in a United Nations quagmire that skipped through 5-8 years of the story at a time. I found myself flipping through pages looking for continuations and answers, but never found them. There's probably a good reason BeauSeigneur self-published the book to begin with -- he couldn't find a publisher to do it."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"After reading this book I felt like I only had part of a whole. This must be a trilogy (The Christ Clone Trilogy) that you have to read together. \`In His Image' by itself is interesting but not very impressive. The time lags and story switching are not smooth, but I again must stress that the concept is thought provoking. Many readers seem to draw comparisons between this series and the \`Left Behind' series. I have not read the \`Left Behind' books but none of its advertisements, movies, or word of mouth ever interested me. This series, on the other hand, still has my attention and respect."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"This series MUST be read in it's entirety. Under no circumstanc-es can you stop on book one or two, or you will do yourself a total injustice. This series by far exceeds the Left Behind's. I was so 'afraid' as I was reading, worrying about where it was actually going. As a Christian, I was reading things that had me wondering what this author was truly doing. For him to be able to have written and have the reader actually wonder to that extent, only shows the extreme talent and gift this man has(plus obvious years of true research this man has done). As I finished book three this morning, my husband came out to find me crying as I read. The emotion that you feel is overwhelming and as real as if you are experiencing the events. When you find a book that can do this, you must not allow yourself to be deprived of this read! We are avid readers of assorted subjects. But this is by far my favorite. The author does not spend wasted and unnecessary time on trivial details and 100 different characters who have no meaning in the end anyway. Yet, he is still able to give you such detail that you can 'feel' and 'smell' and 'sense' each event. You can create a personal feeling toward, or against, each person you are being introduced to in this story. I have not read a better book. No one can KNOW what it will truly be like, but Mr. BeauSeigneur has put this book of fiction into such an excellent masterpiece. Although we have read many of the Rapture books, including the full series of the Left Behinds, this trilogy is in a class of it's own. The L.B.'s feel like books for youngsters to me now after having read the Christ Clone Trilogy. Book 3 is your climax, but you must read the previous two first. It is easy to see how some people could actually be 'swayed' or question themselves when this time comes. It WILL happen so quickly and seem as the 'right' thing to many at that time. Millions will be fooled. The personal relationship with Christ will be needed to survive the Tribulation, in addition to knowledge of God's Word. The Lord has told us all; we all have the information, the prophesy's (done and remaining) have been made available for all. This is truly a Christian's book. Kudo's on Kudo's for this book. I personally hope to be able to contact Mr. BeauSeigneur via email or letter, (that information is available at the end of the book) to tell him how moved and truly blessed by his writing and that I sincerely hope to see more of his work soon. That is how much I loved this book! He is an exceptionally talented and gifted man! We thank him for his obvious love of the Lord and look forward to more of his wonderful work!"},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"THE CHRIST CLONE TRILOGY is the perfect addition for readers of the LEFT BEHIND series. See the Tribulation from the other side with an Antichrist you'd be proud to take home to meet mom and dad. He's just sooooo good at being bad! But hang in there, the truth comes out in the end. I loved the TRILOGY so much I'm going to read it again while I wait for THE REMNANT to come out!!!"},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"A team of research scientists is given brief access to study the Shroud of Turin, believed by some to be the burial cloth of Jesus. Decker Hawthorne, a journalist, finds out that one of his old professors (before he changed his major from pre-med to journalism), Harry Goodman, is on the team, and manages to get himself included as an assistant. Although their findings are largely inconclusive, Goodman later discovers live human skin cells from the shroud. These he uses to develop many promising cancer and AIDS treatments, granting Decker exclusive access to publish his findings first. But Goodman also uses the cells, believed to be from the ressurrected Christ, to create a clone whom he initially passes off as his nephew, Christopher. Before long it becomes apparent that there is something different and special about Christopher, and some believe he is to usher in a \\"New Age\\" of religion.Evaluating it merely as a suspense thriller, it certainly has it's moments. Some of the early sections of the book are particularly good, such as battles between Israel and several Arab nations which is reminiscent of \\"Red Storm Rising\\" by Tom Clancy. But around the middle of the book (this is only the first of three) it bogs down as both Decker and a grown-up Christopher become involved in the United Nations. Some of the intrigue between various members provides for some interest, but it's mostly coasting on the steam built up in the first half of the book.And while I'd like to evaluate the book only as a fictional novel, it's impossible to ignore that fact that this is a religious-based book. The author includes a statement at the beginning asking readers to remember that the opinions expressed by fictional characters in his books do not necessarily represent his own opinions. And while I personally found some parts rather distasteful (particularly the excerpts from the next book), I must admit that his story and ideas are interesting. Even some of his historical explanations were interesting, such as how the Shroud could actually have been what some claim it to be, in spite of carbon dating proving it's not that old. Additionally, it seems well researched, even containing many footnotes (I assume they're legitmate references), and he certainly seems to have a good knowledge of scriptures.Overall, it's a very interesting idea and has some very good parts but it bogs down too much and becomes very boring. And the excerpts from the second book certainly didn't make me eager to keep reading the trilogy."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"No matter your background, the Christ Clone Trilogy will make you think, and I think that is the trademark shared by all of the best fiction. Most readers will find parts in the series that will challenge their views and preconceptions. Such challenges are good, because they cause us to explore our own beliefs, which can either change them or make them even stronger.There are elements in the series that may seem surprising, and possibly even objectionable, but I urge everyone to read through the whole series before coming to any judgements. The Christ Clone has so many twists and turns that it often seems headed in directions that it may not really be going. I promise readers that if they stick it out until the end, they won't regret it.A must read for this current age!"},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"It is difficult to put in words the power of BeauSeigneur's The Christ Clone Trilogy holds without the grave risk of understating. Using real events to pull the reader into the story (or as another reviewer put it - invading my real world and turning it on its head), BeauSeigneur has created the scariest, deepest, most intesting, and undoubtedly the best book I've read in a long time. When I started In His Image, I couldn't put it down. When I finished Acts of God, I immediately began to reading the series again. Even now, after I've finnaly somewhat gotten over it, there are still some nights I can't sleep thinking about this unbelievably incredible book."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"It's hard to imagine how Mr. BeauSeigneur could go any further than a story about cloning Jesus from live cells found on the Shroud of Turin. But as if that's not earth-shaking enough, this premise is only the tip of the plot iceberg! For below the surface there lurks intrigue, destruction of Jerusalem's Wailing Wall, the mysterious \\"Disaster\\" that takes 15-20% of the world's population, Arab-Israeli religious war, conspiracy and nuclear destruction in Northern Asia, political deceit in the United Nations, the clone's reluctant rise to power, and war between India and Pakistan. And all of it is neatly and tightly held together. This is the kind of story line folks like Tom Clancy or Stephen King can only wish for. BeauSeigneur is a wonderous storyteller and this is an A+ plot."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"I stopped reading the LEFT BEHIND series after the third book because of the lack of depth to the characters and the authors' seeming ignorance of the scale of the plot. Many of the reviewers on the LEFT BEHIND board recommended this trilogy, so I decided to give it a try. After reading IN HIS IMAGE, I was pleased and will gladly read the next two books as soon as I can.Characters first. There are many of them, and they are genuine and varied. There may be a few too many of them, and BeauSeigneur seems to lose track of them over broad swaths of time. There are Jews, Christians, Jewish Christians, agnostics, and \\"New Age\\" spiritualists, but religious beliefs hardly figure prominently in the book, although they are discussed in depth when they matter. That's because the plot takes place over 30+ years. Most if not all the characters seem like good people, but BeauSeigneur paints a vivid portrait of a world in which well-established characters with good intentions compromise their way into becoming bad guys. It is not fully realized by the end of the book, but the inklings are there.Setting next. BeauSeigneur treats the religious and political subject material professionally and appropriately. The reader will appreciate his deep knowledge and fair treatment of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. He also comes off as knowledgeable in missile defense and air combat. Much of the book deals with the internal politics of the United Nations. These settings are sufficiently credible to immerse the reader in this fictional world.Finally plot. Whereas in the LEFT BEHIND series the plot drives the characters, here the characters drive the plot, which I cannot emphasize enough. You get a sense that what is coming is not fixed precisely by prophecy, which gives the book a feeling of constant suspense. BeauSeigneur wastes no time in moving it along at a swift pace. He doesn't belabor a point, and this quality of understatement in my opinion is what makes it head & shoulders above LEFT BEHIND. The only frustration I had was that the enormous ground covered by the plot did not allow some characters to be fleshed out as much as I wanted."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"I've read the Left Behind Series, and I agree with the large number of reviewers who believe The Christ Clone Trilogy and \\"Conquest of Paradise\\" are superior to the popular series. Both books offer an element of reality that is lacking in the Left Behind Series. With \\"In His Image\\", BeauSeigneur begins his tribulation series with the adventures of Decker Hawthorne, a young journalist and former student of Prof. Goodman, a man who clones a human being from blood samples found on the Shroud of Turin. The result is Christopher Goodman, a young boy of astounding intelligence and worldly insight. This first book follows Christopher's maturation into a man of influence and power, under the stewardship of Hawthorne following his mentor's death. This is definitely a great alternative for those who believe the Left Behind Series is too \\"cartoon-ish\\" and simplistic in its portrayal of world events. Fans of the genre will also do well to read \\"Conquest of Paradise\\" and \\"The Last Day\\", two books that also offer the same quality alternative to Left Behind. Overall, a great book!"},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"I can't believe some people have actually given these books bad reviews. The Christ Clone Triology is one of the best series ever. If you just read the first one, you are truly missing out, because the series gets better as it progresses. I think the author did a wonderful job of intergrating scripture, many perspectives, and a new concept. The trilogy didn't leave me with any unanswered questions, which is unusual for a book. Cudos to James BeauSeigneur, your work has not gone unappreciated."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"This is a very readable series that covers some very problematic themes. BeauSeigneur, in the first two books anyway, does a great job of combining religion, history, scifi, and mystery into a hard-to-put-down story. There are likely to be some uncomfortable moments for any reader, as BeauSeigneur sends us through historical details and quite a bit of both conventional (Christian) and unconventional (New Age) theology.The series begins with an enthralling recounting of an investigation of the Shroud of Turin. I had a hard time deciding what was fact or fiction, but BeauSeigneur provides enough references to make us (at least those like me that are not well-versed in the actual events surrounding the Shroud) believe that this version must be fairly close to the truth. Tragedy follows for the lead characters, and the most gripping moments in the series are in the first book.The momentum of the storyline, and BeauSeigneur's obvious depth of research easily move us through questions and &quot;weirder&quot; moments; e.g., I kept asking myself through parts of the 2nd book, &quot;does this guy really want us to buy into this New Age stuff or not?.&quot; Theologically, this book was the most uncomfortable of the three, but in a good way.The final book was very much a let down for me. The series transitioned from something that made me question my own perceptions and beliefs, and hardened into BeauSeigneur's vision. His views don't follow closely to mine, so other readers are clearly more satisfied with book 3 than I was. Even so, I rate this series as an excellent read: four stars out of five."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"I'm a skeptic. Since my childhood days seated on hard floors in darkened church gymnasiums where end-time movies played with seventies schmaltz, where the only thing left behind was any feeling in my buns, I've wondered why so many get fixated on this subject of the apocalypse. Out of curiousity, I caved in and read the first few \\"Left Behind\\" books. I soon found myself frustrated by the lack of depth.Then, on a friend's recommendation, I gambled on \\"The Christ Clone Trilogy.\\" Man alive! This first book convinced me there is hope for this sub-genre. James BeauSeigneur paints a broad and sprawling canvas that, nonetheless, remains focused. He mixes in biblical prophecy, Jewish tradition, scientific study, and political intrigue. He startles with his twists and turns. He creates a believable and entertaining scenario for the earth's last days, as spoken of in the Bible, yet leaves us guessing as to where he's taking us. Judging by his research and the conversations of his Messianic Jew characters, I'm willing to believe that all will be revealed in its time.The author does, I must warn you, use a few naughty words--you know, the ones that you could find in old western books. (Not the hangup for me that it seems to be with a few other reviewers.) BeauSeigneur doesn't get caught up in much character development; he lets the framework of the plot reveal these people to us. Considering the scope of this story, he still manages to maintain our interest in the individual characters, and I guess that's all we need. Sure, they lack some of the emotional intrigue of the \\"Left Behind\\" books, but at least I didn't feel I was being duped by corny twists and off-the-wall late-morning-TV drama.Most amazing of all, to me, is that BeauSeigneur has put so much of his own time and self into the publication of the book. I'd love to see his stuff in the hands of a big-time publisher who could do some minor editing and give this book the attention it deserves. I've already purchased the next two in the series and plan to get reading soon."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"Finally, out of the ghetto of the evangelical subculture, comes a refreshing, well thought out, and methodically researched look at the end of the age. And not since, C.S. Lewis have we seen such creativity and imagination in its presentation. Bravo! More! -J. Nordmoe, Vanderbilt University Library"},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"The first book of the trilogy starts off with two chapters detailing the project to prove/disprove the legitimacy fo the Shroud of Turin. From there the novel gets into the fictitious part of the story, which is very very good.Now, every reviewer so far has compared this trilogy to the &quot;Left Behind&quot; series, and I vowed to not do the same. However, I will say that the author is much better at creating characters who have some depth. He is no Charles Dickens, but these are not as paper thin as the Rayford and Chloe Steele's in the Left Behind. Furthermore, the first novel alone covers more than thirty years in which things are slowly changing, whereas in Left Behind events take place at the speed of light.The plot is much more developed than I might have expected, as BeauSeigneur combines political, scientific and military themes in a well thought out tapestry. He includes military conflict not only between Israel and her Arab neighbors, but between China, India and Pakistan. When you combine this with the overall religious theme of the end-times, you can't miss."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"I have read the &quot;Left Behind&quot; series, the &quot;Omega Trilogy&quot; and now, this trilogy. There is NO comparison. I read the entire trilogy in five days, and was riveted from start to finish. It is not the easiest read, as it is very thoroughly researched, in-depth, and maturely written. An interesting premise comes from the fact that it is told from the perspective of the Anti-Christ. There are surprises around every corner and the ending will take your breath away!"},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"This is the first book in a fantastic trilogy. It portrays the end times in an extremely engaging story, which is very intelligently written. The reader is slowly guided into a Christian perspective over the course of the series. In fact, it is difficult to tell that the first book is even a work of Christian fiction, as it deals with the last days from a very secular perspective which will appeal to Christians and non-Christians alike. I personally loved the way in which various end time prophecies came to pass in non supernatural ways. The events prophesied in the Bible are initally brought to fruition using natural forces that God has already put into place in this world. I could not put this series down and literally plowed through all three books, one after the other. Get these books."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"Intelligent accurate fiction with a Christian world-view: Is The Christ Clone Trilogy a new genre or has Christian fiction, in a single leap, both come of age and surpassed the quality of most secular fiction? Whichever it is, James BeauSeigneur has established himself as both the creator and master with his first three books. The tremendous scope of the novel and the way that BeauSeigneur weaves fact, fiction and faith is extraordinary. I eagerly await whatever BeauSeigneur puts his awesome talent to next."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"I was reading some of the reviews that rated this book poorly, and I think their reviews are based more on bias than the true nature of this book and the series as a whole. The writing isn't perfect, or flowery, but it is a well crafted story that makes this an excellent read.The Christ Clone trilogy is written in a secular way, because it's not preachy like the &quot;Left Behind&quot; series, which I thought was dreadful. This series of books will actually make most Christians squirm, but I PROMISE YOU that if you read the whole series you will be thoroughly satisfied. The author does a superb job at making you believe what he wants you to believe, and then turning it all on it's head. I don't want to give anything away, but I want you to know that this is an excellent trilogy that you should read ASAP!"},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"This is one of the best series of books I have ever read...regardless of genre. You &quot;live&quot; these books as you read them, never being quite sure what did/will happen versus what *might* happen. It is all too believable. The author's talent of mixing historical fact and footnotes throughout the book require a constant reminder that you are reading a work of fiction. Five stars are just not enough."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"I'm not all that articulate to begin with, but this book has really challenged me to come up with anything coherent at all. It's such a powerful book that I'll never be able to come close in words to describing its effect on me. But as G. K. Chesterton once said, &quot;Anything worth doing is worth doing poorly.&quot; So here goes.The first thing I noticed when I began to read it was that I was totally wrapped up in the story. In other words, I was able to suspend disbelief entirely without even realizing I'd done it! When that happens, I know I'm on to a great story.The second thing I noticed is that I had the hardest time figuring out what was going to happen. That may seem like a bad thing in a novel, but, frankly, I've read too many end times books that were almost totally predictable--not to mention any names. So it was refreshing for me to be all the time trying to figure where the story's going, only to be fooled at the last moment.But what really got me is just how hard-hitting and impactful this story is. You don't often get that with religious fiction. Too many times it's watered down. Not this book. It ran over me like a bullet train.So what's the wait? Read this book now. Before you get left behind."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"I had been reading the Left Behind Series and saw the Christ Clone Trilogy listed as books that others had bought. I read the reviews of the trilogy and thought I'd give it a shot. And I was very pleased with the results. The books are fantastic. As a Christian, I was almost ready to put the book down because I felt the direction he was going was anti-christian, but I stuck it out because I wanted to see where he would go. The author does a great job keeping you on the edge of your seat and building a deceptive belief of what is good and what is evil. If you like the Left Behind Series, you'll like this trilogy much better. And if you didn't like the Left Behind Series, I think you will really enjoy this one. Excellent books!"},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"After being left hanging by Left Behind series I was desperate for a conclusion to an end times story. I had heard that this trilogy was exciting and well done so I bought all three books. I forced myself to read the first book, yawn. It laid the groundwork for the story, but it was boring. The second book was a bit better, still no real rush. The third book had promise, but ultimately was a race to the end. The climax was a huge disappointment. I'm giving the books to the used book store. Not something I'd recommend."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"I personally didn't enjoy this book very much, but I will try to write a fair review.To start off, this book is not compareable to the Left Behind Series. Not because it is better or worse than the LB Series, but because it isn't the same type of book. When I bought this book I was looking for an edge-of-your-seat type of thriller. I was disapointed. There is almost no action in this book. Mostly talk with a lot of disjointed events. I am not knowledgeable enough to speak on the accuracy of the end times prophecy(did I spell that right?). The foot notes at the bottom of the page indicate he correctness of the reproduction of real events. This is why I gave the book two stars. Well writen, for a person who doesn't want to stay up all night and read. I had no problem puting this book down! This book is also written from a non christian's perspective. As a result, there is A LOT of profanity. No sex, just offensive words. I kept a count in the back of the book of the number of words. The final Tally: FIFTY-EIGHT offensive wods and phrases. To a christian that is enough to turn you away in disgust. I am sorry that I was decived by the glowing reviews of this book. I hope to warn others about this book. Please cosider carefully before buying this book. It lacks the suspense of the LB Series and the language will lower your standards."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"The concept of cloning Jesus is interesting, and it's rather too bad that you know from early on that Christopher is going to turn out to be the AntiChrist. He's such a likeable character that the author could've strung me along for quite some time on that point, making me wonder if he was supposed to be the Second Coming or one of the Witnesses or something.I was also struck by how unaffected the main characters were by the tragedies they endured: Decker & Tom didn't seem to be psychologically harmed by two years of solitary confinement and torture. And sure, people missed their loved ones lost in The Disaster, but the grief seemed a bit hollow. And no one ever put together that it was only the born-again Christians that were affected by the Disaster - don't they have BLOGs in the post-apocolyptic world?I see from other reviews that I will have to schlog my way through the second book to reach the joys of the third, so if I can find some *really cheap* used copies, then maybe I'll finish this trilogy."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"I came across this title as I was reading the mediocre reviews for the Left Behind series. For whatever reason I was in the mood to read an \\"End of Days\\" novel (who knows why?). I found the concept of \\"In His Image\\" intriguing so I ordered the book. After finishing it I can say it is a fantastic read; thoroughly researched, fast paced, and very suspenseful. In all honesty I was expecting an average piece of fundamentalist propaganda disguised as a fiction piece. Instead the book truly did read like a Tom Clancy novel but with a realistic science fiction edge to it. What impressed me with the story was how convincing the world politics parts of the story were handled. Everything in the book seems very plausible in today's geo-political climate. Even the theory/story behind the cloning of Jesus was somewhat believable.After reading the first third of the book I went out and ordered books 2 and 3. That's how good I think it is. In fact I'll probably read them back-to-back. Highly recommended.PS I'm not hardcore religious but I know that there are people who are. If those people are offended at the cloning concept of the book I respectfully request that you give the book a shot (even if you approach it as a pure science fiction novel).

If you think he's busy, you'll be blown away by all the events of this book -- they come fast and furious. Decker's old mentor asks him to be a witness to his having found living cells on the Shroud of Turin, but it's not until years later that he realizes his friend and colleague has cloned the cells and is raising the child, named Christopher Goodman. Decker's relationship with the boy as he grows and realizes his destiny is the subject of this first book.A minor complaint I have is that the time jumps are erratic -- several chapters are a few weeks apart and then there's a jump of seven years, then a few weeks, then years later, etc. Otherwise, the plot is mind-blowing, the writing is very good and the characters are interesting.I thoroughly enjoyed this interesting and exciting speculative thriller, and am anxious to read the second novel of the trilogy."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"Will human cloning result in the Antichrist?It sounds like the stuff of pure science fiction. Until......until you read Revelation 17:8. Then suddenly it all makes sense.

So in 60-90 A.D. the Angel could tell John, &quot;he once was, now is not, and yet is to come.&quot; And what if 'he' tickled people's ears by telling them exactly what he wanted to hear?I dare not say more for fear of spoiling your enjoyment, and yet there are so many more amazing twists and turns, that cloning is just the beginning. For instance, did you know there is an Old Testament prophecy that gives a partial physical description of the Antichrist? Or that when you write 144,000 in Hebrew characters (Hebrew uses the same characters for numbers and letters) that it spells the Hebrew words &quot;Koom Damah Patar,&quot; which if you're not a Hebrew scholar, means &quot;Arise, Shed Tears, and Be Free,&quot; which when you think about it, exactly describes the mission of the 144,000 to Israel (see Zechariah 12:10).And, I know novels aren't supposed to have footnotes, but THE CHRIST CLONE TRILOGY is so grounded in fact that it includes more than 200 footnotes from an amazingly wide range of references.Now tell me Left Behind or any other end-times book even comes close to that!"},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"The Christ Clone Trilogy is is a taut, intense, adrenaline-rushing techno-thriller that leaves its readers gasping for breath between pages. The plot is rich with twists and turns waiting to jump out when you least expect them. BeauSeigneur's characters are well developed with believable strengths and very human flaws. The dialogue is smart and believable and occasional humorous twists allow a smile through the tension. The trilogy is well conceived and meets every criteria for a plausible, engaging mystery, regardless of your theological beliefs. Reminiscent of Tom Clancy, Stephen King and C.S.

That's like comparing apples to oranges. I thought the overall books were so much more cerebral. The only character I invested in was Decker Hawthorn so did not miss a deeper characterization from peripheral characters. I had some issues with some of the theology, but felt the author more than explained his reasons in his footnotes. The few issues I had were more about the time lines of the tribulation and not the story or events that occured. I found the trilogy as a whole to be a very satisfying complete work. I will admit that I was a touch bored in book two with the set up and description of the meteors.

You have to keep reading for a bit before you understand where things are going, but it is WELL WORTH IT!! I consider this to be the most well-written, Scripturally accurate, and exciting books written on the subject, and I have read a LOT! James BeauSeigneur has great imagination to tell a story that the Bible says clearly is beyond imagination, and in fact, un-knowable. Many have tried to say what it will be like, but most are either incredibly boring, or too melodramatic, even \\"cheesy,\\" IMHO. The days preceding THAT DAY of the return of Christ are spoken of in the Old Testament, and by Jesus and the apostles in the New Testament... however, we are also told that He will return \\"like a thief in the night\\" and \\"just as in the days of Noah,\\" i.e. everyone will be surprised! I think that this trilogy gives us insight to have faith, to be aware, to share the Good News boldly, and to serve the Lord fervently as the only means of being ready for His coming!He who testifies to these things says, \\"Yes, I am coming quickly.\\" Amen. Come, Lord Jesus. Revelation 22:20"},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"This end-time thriller takes you through the years of the Tribulation as seen through the eyes of unbelievers. But don't be so sure you'll know the good from the bad, and the truth from the lies! This Antichrist is so believable, you'll understand why Jesus warned in Matthew 24:24 that &quot;were it possible&quot; &quot;even the elect&quot; would be deceived! Even if you know your Bible, you may never be certain of who's who until the final book of the series. With the Russia-Israel war (Ez. 38-39) and prophetic judgments that are so frighteningly real and technically accurate, this trilogy will make you feel as though you've lived through it all! This is also a perfect gift for your skeptical non-Christian friends."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"James BeauSeigneur has done the most amazing thing in this remarkable series of books--he's written something that both believers and skeptics can rejoice about.If you're anything like me, you've looked at End Times books with more than a little bit of a jaundiced eye. Too often, everything is given away right at the start of the books. The rest becomes simply preaching to the choir.Not here. Finally, at last, we have a series of books that leaves the reader in doubt as to what is REALLY going on until the middle of the third book. The great thing about this approach is that it MOST CLOSELY ACCORDS WITH HOW END TIMES EVENTS WILL ACTUALLY UNFOLD. In other words, for believers and skeptics alike IT IS ALMOST AS IF THEY ARE EXPERIENCING THE END TIMES AS THEY READ THESE BOOKS.Think about it. If we were actually living in the End Times as the Bible describes them, WE WOULDN'T KNOW IT, WOULD WE. Nor would we know the either the identity of the Antichrist, nor how he would go about enacting his agenda. That's what sets these books apart. The author has written them in such a way that WE JUST DON'T KNOW ANY OF THESE THINGS. It's as if we're living through the End Times as they are actually unfolding.That to me is a great accomplishment, and one that enables readers of whatever stripe--Christian, atheist, agnostic, skeptic--to have an authentic reading experience."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"The author of this book ran for Congress against Al Gore, worked for the NSA, taught political science and edited a newspaper, so he knows what he's writting about.\\"What if Christ was cloned?\\" is the basic premise of the book, and intervowing it with politics and diplomacy, the author crafts a very interesting tale. This book has everything I was looking for in (and did not find in) \\"The DaVinci Code\\": a great story, believable characters, messing with Christian values in a way that some may consider blasphemy, descriptions of Christian, Hebrew and Muslim practices, and a good dose of suspense, without all the overblown hype.I consider this book to be a page-turner. I was hooked by page thirty. I'll definitely get the next two installments. It is important to consider that this is the kind of trilogy were very little is resolved by the end of book one."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"This review is for all three books of the series. If you are going to read this first book, be prepared to simply read all three in succession because the pace and suspense dictate it.The basic premise and storyline of the book series centers on the depictions of the end times prophesied in the Book of Revelation found in the Bible. Unlike other works on the subject, like the popular &quot;Left Behind&quot; series, this story focuses on the events from the perspective of someone who is unaware and even hostile towards the idea that the events unfolding are part of the Biblical story.The story begins with a surprising twist: dermal skin cells are found at the heel of the Shroud of Turin, and subsequently used to clone the person whom the shroud originally covered. This sets off a chain of events that come at you at a dizzying pace. Unlike the &quot;Left Behind&quot; books, the depictions are graphic and disturbing, and the vast destruction caused by asteroids hitting the earth, and various plagues are depicted with a stark horror. The \\"new age\\" references are woven into the story in a way that seems quite similar to how that movement is already forming. It is difficult to tell throughout the story, across all three books, what the philosophical and theological views of the author are, so well written is the perspective of the main character. We are taken along on the journey with him, with little insight into the eventual conclusions. Also excellent are the political workings behind the world government run by the U.N. The rise to power of the political structure is seemless and realistic.The writing is fine, and the story and characters are explored with enough depth to resonate. Essentially this book is about the story of one person who is thrust into the center of the events simply by being &quot;in the right place at the right time&quot;. I recommend the book series for a very different perspective of a familiar story."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"I was drawn to this book because of its premise, and because I also read the first book of the Left Behind series. Be warned that this book is dramatically different...the characters are more fully developed, as is the plot, and the content is geared towards a mainstream audience.During the first 100 pages or so the author painstakingly lays the foundation for the entire trilogy. This is NOT a fast-paced thriller by any means, but it is a startling account of the end times that will challenge you intellectually with shocking, vivid references, and over 200 footnotes. Just when you think you don't get where this book is going, you realize that the whole plot is unfolding right before your eyes. A neat trick by a cunning author.Four Stars because of its use of scientific facts and true-life accounts. BeauSeigneur masterfully weaves these details into a work of fiction that is not only believable, but shocking...and from a literary viewpoint, his writing is flawless.Enjoy.Cris"},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"I found out about this series on the Left Behind web site, it was the best tip I've ever received. The Christ Clone Trilogy is far and away the best end times series I have read. I did think Left Behind was great but this series blew me away. The books are fast paced and amazingly factual. James BeauSeigneur does not pull any punches and shows the reader in detail what is in store for the world. Do yourself a favor and read all three books. Some people think it wraps up at the end of book two but the author will really open your eyes in book three. These books are incredible, I can't praise this trilogy enough."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"Christians who judge these books based on the concept or after reading just the first one or two books need to consider the words of John 7:24, \\"Do not judge according to appearance but judge with righteous judgment.\\" And the words of Ecclesiastes 7:8, \\"The end of a matter is better than its beginning, and patience is better than pride.\\"You may not be able to imagine how a story about cloning Christ could be turned to God's glory, but God has given Mr. BeauSeigneur enough imagination to do exactly that, and to do it VERY VERY WELL! I urge everyone to read these books."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"This is the first book in a trilogy about the end times described in the bible. Having already read other end times fiction, I can recommend this series as the best out there.Unlike the more popular end times fictional series, these books were written for readers who want to think. Character development is three dimentional, rather than flat. Science is carefully joined with end times prophesy for a very chilling, but realistic feeling.If you are looking for &quot;cotton candy for the brain&quot;, these books are not for you and I would point you towards the &quot;Left Behind Series.&quot; If, however, you prefer fiction for the intelligent adult, then these books are just the thing for you.One tip...buy the second and third book in the series together with the first book. You will not want to have to wait for the remaining two books to arrive once you finish book one."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"He's a sly one, this James BeauSeigneur. With red herrings liberally scattered throughout, it's really hard to tell where he's coming from. Is he a New Ager? A fundamentalist Christian? Only The Shadow knows, and he's not telling.As with many other reviewers, I, also, do not like this genre. Haunted by the likes of Salem Kirban, A Thief in the Night, and the notorious Left Behind series, it's not the most happening category around. The Christ Clone Trilogy is different. For one thing, it's far more carefully written and researched than any other End Times fiction I'm aware of. For example, there are all kinds of delicious little plot bombs just waiting to explode in the careless reader's face. The author's knowledge of everything from geopolitics to obscure culturial practices of the Inuit people is remarkable.All in all, a story about the end of the world that's very credible, even persuasive. Try it out, you might like it."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"Like many people I've been reading the Left Behind series and while the authors intentions are noble, the story and writing are elementary.After reading reviews where so many people had recommended the Christ Clone Trilogy as a superior alternative, I felt I had to at least try the first book to compare.I don't know that there is a comparison. For me this book stands head and shoulders over any of the Left Behind books.BeauSeigneur has such a well researched book on his hands, it reads like part sci-fi, part political thriller. And it feels believable. One of the things I loved about the book is that through three quarters of it you really don't know who's good or who's bad. The Left Behind books have such cardboard stock characters there's never any surprises.It also feels very focused. The Left Behind books are on their ninth installment, and it's dragged out narrative has readers losing interest. By making his story complete is three books, BeauSeigner makes every second count, creating a taut tension filled narrative with characters you want to see what will happen to, and a Biblical prophecy brought to life in Tom Clancy/Stephen King dimensions."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"This is one of the most clever concepts I've seen in any book and author James BeauSeigneur executes it perfectly. Left Behind fans should love this series, but be forewarned, there is a smattering of harsh language -- though it's nothing you won't hear on network TV these days. Also, you will have a great deal of difficulty telling who the evil characters are until everything is revealed in Acts of God, the third book of the trilogy. Great books! Enjoy!!"},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"I stopped reading the Left Behind series after #4 (Soul Harvest). I kept hoping it would get better. It didn't. I also read (actually started reading) We All Fall Down, but there the foul language was SO EXCESSIVE I couldn't keep going. Finally I read the books of The Christ Clone Trilogy (why do I feel like Goldilocks here?) and they were &quot;just right!&quot; Actually they're GREAT! So if you're tired of Buck and Rayford playing James Bond, and all the females in the Left Behind world cooing, get The Christ Clone Trilogy."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"I liked how the author used real biblical facts and combined them with a little sci fi. You can't stop with this one, you must read the entire series. It is worth it."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"A masterful job! Something for everyone. And the author has really set us up for a shocker in Book 3!"},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"An excellent series in all. An intelligently written story that takes a different perspective of end-of-times fiction. Vastly more entertaining than the Left Behind drivel..."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"If you can't eat one potato chip, you can't read just one of these well written and well planned books. Even with the strongest beliefs, you will still be carried along until you are broad-sided with the startling turn of events in the last of the trilogy. If you buy one, buy them all and treat yourself to some smooth reading with all the proper footnotes. Bet you can't read just one."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"This book is actually very good once you have read the other 2 books that BeauSigneur has written: Birth of an Age and Acts of God. After reading those 2 books, you'll find yourself going back to re-read this one, In His Image, to fill in some of the plots holes you may have skimmed over.The headline of this review above refers to the pace of the book. It starts off quick, then gets bogged down in Chapter 3, twenty years later. It picks up again when Christopher is a teenager and the Rapture/Disaster occurs.Then it slows down again as the author begins an ultra-tedious description of the setting up of the new United Nations based on 10 regions of the world. Then it picks up again right near the end and never slows down through the next 2 books.Without spoiling things, one does wonder about some of the theological conclusions that the author comes to: about the origins of Christopher, and his seeming lack of choice in fulfilling his destiny. That question is the big letdown throughout the trilogy.But no more spoilers -- for now!! Keep reading, the next 2 books are the pageturners!!"},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"Wow what a rollercoaster thrill ride and thats just the first book! I am hungry for the next installment a great religious thriller I was glued to every page!"},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"This entire series is great. For me, the detailed approach to explaining prophecy made it all so believable. The plot is fast-paced and enthralling, and the writing style is smooth and pleasing to read. A great beach book, or night stand reader."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"Even though I don't agree with BeauSeigneur's positions on some things, I must admit that he's done a remarkable job in writing this trilogy. I read too many books to keep everything I read, but these books have earned a permanent place on my bookshelf. I will be reading them again soon."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"In the first few pages of this book published in 2003,we are informed \\"Every type of nondestructive test that Decker could imagine was included. One experiment that had been rejected was carbon 14 dating, because the then-current method would have required that a large piece of the Shroud be destroyed to yield an accurate measurement.\\"And yet in the real world Samples were taken from the Shroud on 21 April, 1988, and given to laboratories in Arizona, Oxford and Zurich for testing where it has been proven beyond any reasonabledoubt (notice the word reasonable, not nutball), that the shroud was a fraud worked up around the 14th century.That kind of kills my interest in this gibberish right at the start of the 'novel'. If Christian literature is ever going to escape the big-foot, UFO category, these folks are going to have to start paying attention to reality a little bit more."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"The Christ Clone Trilogy is a series that deals in another view of Revelation. Unlike the &quot;Left Behind&quot; series this series is seen from a personal view of one close to the Antichrist and until the third book very little is related to the Revelation. However, the 3rd book does cover all aspects with quotes and references. Since the \\"Left Behind\\" series is not complete the Christ Clone series does present the entire view of James BeauSeigneur.In all I found the series thoughtful and different."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"I got this book based on the overwhelming popular reviews that I read here on Amazon.com. Please do not get this book if you are into end times fiction. I could not even finish this book because it was boring and it was not scriptural. For all the people who says the \\"Left Behind\\" series is awful, then they really need to read this book. The author is way off base with his ideas."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"GREAT book! I like the Left Behind series better though."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"I don't want to give anything away about this story, but even if I did, I don't think I would spoil it for you. The Christ Clone Trilogy is packed with mysteries within mysteries within mysteries within ... (well, you get the idea).If you've read the Left Behind series, you may may begin to wonder what they've gotten yourself into. Things don't happen the way the do in Left Behind, but you'll find that the author has done some amazing research and analysis (including studies of the original Greek) before telling the story in such an unexpected way. The best example may be how the Rapture is portrayed. It's nothing like Left Behind, but if you can't wait, go to pages 119 and 120 of book 3 (Acts of God). The author explains his presentation very convincingly (he changed my mind). But while the story is very different, BeauSeigneur and LaHaye have the same pre-trib/pre-mil eschatology, so if something doesn't seem quite right, keep reading: it will be explained.The Christ Clone Trilogy is much more real life than Left Behind and you may lose track of what is real and what is fiction, especially in post-9/11 America. It's grittier than Left Behind and aimed at the lost more than at the choir. Some characters in these books occasionally use harsh language (less than in some of C.S. Lewis's best known fiction), but don't expect BeauSeigneur's false prophet and the Antichrist to say, &quot;Golly, gee!&quot;Over all this is a ground-breaking series, and if you've been secretly or openly disappointed with the quality of Christian fiction, I think you'll agree that with The Christ Clone Trilogy, Christian fiction has finally come of age."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"I can't believe I bought all three books!!! I could just kick myself!!! I started to read book one and I got about half way through. I kept reading, hoping that it would get better but it never did. This book had very short segments of interesting reading followed by whole pages and pages of boring super way too detailed stretches of reading. I love reading but this book turned it into a chore for me. I was definitely fooled by all the positive reviews, never again will I buy all the books in a series before reading book one. I know! I know! My bad! I would not recommend this book! Please stay away!"},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"I had read a review where the Christ Clone Trilogy was compared to Dan Brown's DaVinci Code. I love Dan Brown's books so based on that review I purchased the first two books in the Christ Clone Trilogy. THEY ARE TERRIBLE!! I was greatly disappointed. There is so much focus on disaster, the writing is stilted, the characters are shallow, and the misrepresentation of Jesus Christ and his apostles is just too much. This is the worst book I've read in a long time. The \\"disclaimer\\" at the beginning of the book asks us to suspend judgement until all three books have been read, and I admit I only got half way through the second book and just couldn't go on. It was SO DEPRESSING and it twisted the teachings of the New Testament to an uncomfortable degree. I know these books are fiction, but I still wonder what Mr. BeauSeigneur was trying to accomplish. I ended up throwing both books away - I wasn't about to donate them to our local library for anyone else to read them because they were so bad. Any Christian would be very uncomfortable reading this book."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"I read this series years ago and couldn't get it out of my mind. I bit hook line and sinker just like Decker (the main character) did and I was very angry at myself. Years later I had to read the books again to try to figure out how the author crafted the facade that fooled me so. The book is a real eye opener, a great series. Book one was a little slow but makes perfect sense and was the building blocks for the other two books which were hard hitting and nightmarish. A great read."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"This series is awesome. I wished I had picked it up a long time ago. I'd have to say that it completely blows away the Left Behind series and it's only 3 books. Don't get me wrong, I think the Left Behind series had its place, but this series is much more accurate in describing what will happen and much much more realistic. The detail that the author goes through is great and this book really gets you thinking about what could happen during this terrible time. I give this book 5 stars because it will have you at the edge of your seat and wanting more."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"As the author ofThe Second Virgin BirthI would have to say that the book started by introducing characters and setting a real scientific backgroud for the premise of the story. I would recomend this book to anyone who has read and enjoyed the \\"Left Behind\\" series as an alternative view of their future,"},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"Note: This review is for the original, unedited first editions. The newer edition is edited from its original content.This book was recommended to me by some people in a \\"Left Behind\\" reading group, and I enjoyed it immensely. This book is very realistic- much more so than the Left Behind books. Sure, there are the occasional profanities, but it is well within what those particular characters would actually say. Yes, the AntiChrist is evil and encourages his people to do terrible things later on, but isn't that what the AntiChrist will actually do?This author is a fundamentalist Christian who did extensive research in writing the series. Where else can you find footnotes in fiction, referring the reader to where he found the material backing up his fictional tale?If you want pleasantries, stick with the Left Behind books. They are good, but these are better. If you want a realistic and powerful portrayal of the End Times events, read this series now. These books will encourage anyone to become a believer so they can miss out on the Tribulation!"},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"An engrossing blend of politics, religion, New Age, end-of-the-world prophecy, and science, James BeauSeigneur's In His Image keeps readers turning pages. His masterful plotting weaves an international cast of characters through world-changing events (including the cloning of Jesus and two nuclear holocausts) that are made entirely believable because of BeauSeigneur's meticulous research and eyewitness-quality detail."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"Good book. Very thought provoking, offering explanations and theories you've probably never thought about. Brought together in a very orderly fashion, great ending! Looking forward to part two!"},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"Considering myself spiritual AND literate may make me a commoditiy, but I think hardly a rare one. This thinly veiled telling of John's Apocalypse appeals to neither side of me. An addition to the growing list of fundamentalist novels, it will have appeal to the Wednesday night study group, but I fear, not to many more. As a Christian, I found the pseudo-scientific approach to Christ's return insulting. (Do we really think that He will come again by being cloned from cells scraped off the shroud of Turin? Really!) As a reader, I thought the writing too weak to grab me in its own right. (I never learn enough about the manchild to really care about him.) I see that it has been revised to a second edition. This must be a unique event; a novel rewritten to make the story more accurate. Per haps my expectations were too high, but I fear that Christian Literature has not found its Faulkner. Read this if neither mind nor soul need exercise,"},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"After reading several of the Left Behind series book, which I enjoyed from a spritual standpoint, I heard about these books through the Amazon reviews. This series, though less spiritually nurishing, (I don't think the authored intended it to be.) provides a realistic and exciting interpretation of the end times. You don't have to develop a huge mental \\"suspension of disbelief.\\" The characters are real. The anti-Christ character is well developed from beginning to end. You route for him NOT to turn {bad}. As soon as I finished part one, I jumped into part two and the couldn't wait to finish part three.I do not personally believe in rapture theory, but I thoroughly enjoyed this read."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"Unlike Left Behind and most other fiction books on prophecy, The Christ Clone Trilogy is anchored in the real world. This gives it a sense of authenticity that other books/series are missing. In light of current events, I was particularly struck by the way BeauSeigneur fulfills some of the Seal judgments of Revelation with a war between India and Pakistan, which ultimately goes nuclear and draws in China. I was very impressed with In His Image and will definitely buy the other two books of the trilogy."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"For so long, every fictional novel written about Christianity has seemed like it was aimed squarely at a third grade reading level. Why? If ever there was a topic that screamed out for intellegent exploration in fiction, Christianity was it. But all anyone ever seemed interested in was preaching from a stance of self-rightousness and writting about cardboard characters. The Christ Clone trilogy breaks that mold and I was thrilled to read it. If you want to read an intellegent exploration of Christianity, buy this book. I'd also strongly recomend Brian Caldwell's We All Fall Down. Caldwell looks at Christianity from a slightly diffirent angle, but his exploration is every bit as penetrating and his writting nothing short of brilliant. These two authors have finally done the topic justice. About time."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"Like many end-times fiction works, this story parallels biblical prophecies, mostly in tune with the interpretations espoused by Hal Lindsey in THE LATE GREAT PLANET EARTH. Unlike most other works, however, BeauSeigneur weaves a rich, gripping tale, told from the perspective of the confused &quot;man in the middle.&quot; The protaganist is not an &quot;almost Christian,&quot; who converts as soon as his loved ones disappear. Rather, he is an intelligent, thoughtful man who struggles through the series, trying to do what is right. We struggle with him--understanding why he does not immediately &quot;get it.&quot;There are many twists and turns in the plot that keep the suspense level high. The author creates a true dilemma--stretching all readers--regardless of their current religiosity. Additionally, there is a sophistication here that many other novels in this genre lack.The bottom line: read this book! My hope is that a major publishing house discovers this talented author."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"All three of the Christ Clone trilogy books will peak your interest if you're into theology or science. The age old debate of religion vs. science is a hot one, and James BeauSeigneur does an excellent job of raising questions that interest many of us. Don't go into this expecting a typical view of the Bible and religion. If you keep an open mind and realize it's one man's interpretation and imagination, you'll find it an excellent read."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"I bought the three books at once and I've never read a end-time serie so brilliant. Now the Trilogy will be released in Portuguese (my native language, I live in Brazil) and I'm anxious to give the Trilogy in Portuguese to all my friends. You can't leave the opportunity of reading ALL THREE BOOKS!!!"},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"I was turned on to the genre by reading the Left Behind series, but thought that there was much more to be desired. Mr Beausinger more than delivers this with a good story backed by his in-depth research. I have already ordered the next two."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"I can understand why readers would compare THE CHRIST CLONE TRILOGY to LEFT BEHIND, but allow me to be blunt. LEFT BEHIND is not even in the same league with the books of THE CHRIST CLONE TRILOGY! The LEFT BEHIND series jabbers on endlessly about paper-thin characters and barely deals with the events of prophecy. More time is spent in book 4 of LEFT BEHIND talking about renting a car than is given to three of the prophetic trumpet judgments.THE CHRIST CLONE TRILOGY is filled with plot twists and turns that could Tom Clancy's head spin, but it stays completely within prophectic boundaries. There are some things that BeauSeigneur protrays in a very manner different than what you might expect, but he backs everything with facts and scripture. Whether he is right or not in how he presents the story, we'll have to wait and see, but when you finish this trilogy you will feel as though you have lived through the last days of planet Earth."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"James Beausigneur combined christian mythology about the apocalips with the best of espionage, thrillers and science fiction novels. He researched the basis (on for instance the shroud of Turin) very well, which makes the story even more believable. And he carefully unfolds the filosofical and political implications of the cloning of Jesus at the end of the 20th century. He has a good eye for the historical and biblical facts and the way the international powers of today work. It's a must read. Unputdownable!"},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"On the one hand, this book has a lot of flaws. I found it very hard to read, and had to take frequent breaks to get back with the game. But I read it, and I'm going to buy the next book. I don't understand that contradiction any more than you do.The dialogue is written as though the author was still learning the craft. He has a tendency to bundle together punctuation marks as though he were writing a comic book script (?!). This People speak in well-wrought complete sentences, and at key moments, every line is heavy with portent. Dialogue-heavy sections are kind of hard to get through.The narrative hopscotches over long periods of time. Chapter headings will begin with &quot;Eight Years Later,&quot; like the title card in a Flash Gordon serial. And a lot of narrative is wrapped in long character monologues, the kind of speech science fiction editors deride as &quot;Well, You See, Timmy...&quot;Author James BeauSeigneur knows a lot of facts regarding the Bible, exigetical research, Jewish national history, and scientific research regarding holy relics. He throws these facts in, but feels the need to footnote everything, as though this were his doctoral thesis. Unless BeauSeigneur doesn't trust his audience, why would he pepper his novel with source notes? There are sixty-six footnotes in the book, including no less than two that simply urge readers not to kill the messenger.If this book weren't carried forward by the idea of a living clone of Jesus Christ from the Shroud of Turin, I doubt any respectable publisher would have touched it. Yet it IS about that idea. And the consideration is so thoroughly in keeping with contemporary social and political impetus that we can imagine a cloned Jesus might indeed behave in the way depicted if he came along in this day and age (though with more organic dialogue).The viewpoint character is Decker Hawthorne, a sometime journalist turned political operative, who through a bizarre quirk of events comes to be the warden of Christopher Goodman, who was cloned from biological traces left on the Shroud of Turin. The plot is Gordian in its convolutions, and there's a strong sense that it's setting up for the next book rather than telling its own story. Yet the setup is complex enough that, if you take enough aspirin breaks, it will hold your attention just fine.The book is somehow awful, yet it's compelling enough that I intend to buy the next book. I don't understand. Neither will you, but you'll read this one and go on to the next as well."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"James BeauSeigneur shows himself to be a master at keeping you on the edge of your seat! His plot twists keep you guessing, even if you're familiar with the prophetic end-times. Even though the Trilogy is a work of fiction, the scientific, medical, and political scholarship is extraordinary. BeauSeigneur has certainly done his homework! And while the technical detail in the book is incredible, it does nothing to bog down the story. In fact, it enhances the story all the more.The Christ Clone Trilogy never strays outside of what Scripture tells us, though it does take some very unexpected twists. While the trilogy may not follow the usual &quot;party line&quot; on all subjects, BeauSeigneur never, ever violates Scripture. In fact, he documents Scripture more than any other end-times writer I've read.This book is a must-read. If you haven't read it, you're missing out on one of the best reads of your life."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"I read these books after seeing them compared to what would result if Stephen King had written Left Behind. So I figured they must be like King's novel The Stand which loosely deals with the same topic.Unlike The Stand, however, The Christ Clone Trilogy (TCCT) sticks very closely to the prophecy of the Bible. Unlike Left Behind, TCCT is intelligently written with plot twists and a roller-coaster pace that will have your heart pounding almost from start to finish.There's one other thing TCCT has that most fictions books are missing: scholarship. I highly recommend these books to everyone!"},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"As a big fan of the &quot;Left Behind&quot; series by Jenkins and LaHaye I thought that I hit it big when I saw another series of books that I thought delt with a Christian topic. I sure was wrong! THESE BOOKS ARE NOT BASED ON CHRISTIANITY! Not only that, but the writing is horrible."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"Poor James BeauSeigneur. Wait til he goes to heaven and finds out how annoyed God is over these terrible books. Maybeif the author realized that people enjoy reading books with plot and character and sense, he might try his hand again at writing. God knows, he needs professional help."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"The premise of this book is intriguing: a clone of Christis made from cells found on the Shroud of Turin; eventsensue from there. You can easily debate just how Beauseigneurgets around the fact that the Shroud is pretty convincinglyproven to be a hoax, but after a lifetime of reading sciencefiction and fantasy, I can forgive a little hand-wavingover technical details to advance the plot.And its a good plot; the story really drew me in deeply.While I don't agree with Beauseigneur's literalist scripturalinterpretations, I am inclined to enjoy apocalypticfiction.It's a plot that draw me in, despite my disagreements withthe author's theology and politics.That being said...on purely technical merits, Beauseigneuris a hack. Page after page of exposition in the \\"of courseyou know\\" style. Generally flat and uninteresting sentences.Brick subtle foreshadowing. The story may be good, but theliterary style is high school creative writing.On a side note, I've noted reviews that complained aboutvulgar and/or obscene language in the book. Now, I'm notas likely to notice such words as some are, but I've personallybeen surprised by the lack of such language. Perhaps itwas \\"cleaned up\\" for the new hardbound edition."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"Absolutely a MUST read series. I've read all three books and literally could not put them down.MUCH, MUCH better than the Left Behind series which frankly is getting a bit too long now. However, BeauSeigneur crafts a story based on information of today. He hits all the major issues and does it without preaching or becoming parochial. I have been telling everyone to get the books and so now I will tell EVERYONE to get the books. They are well worth reading.I want more of this author and the sooner the better."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"Having just read all 3 books in the Christ Clone Trilogy, I have to conclude that it was an extremely well done series. In the first book, I was unsure whose side to be on. Certainly throughout this trilogy, plot supersedes characterization. Nevertheless, I feel it is much better than the Left Behind series. The plot line is really, really good. The message of the story is also excellent. I'm sure the author was most concerned with making a point, and he accomplished this goal.My only minor complaint is that as a Roman Catholic, I took exception to the almost nonexistence of the Church. Of course the theology of the Rapture is within 200 years new, and the Church does not interpret scripture the way ths writer presents it. But I read the book as a novel. In that sense, it was very satisfying.I would strongly recommend reading all 3 books in the series, as the third book is by far the best. You will be neither bored nor disappointed in the development and finale. Also, there is a thought-provoking twist to how the Antichrist is able to deceive the multitudes, convincing the multitudes that evil is good and good is evil. If I'd have to summarize the moral to this story it would be that \\"The devil was a liar from the beginning.\\""},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"Absolutely devoured this book.I was hesitant to order this book because of the \\"religious\\" overtones, although the reviews were simply too good to ignore.This is the type of book I really enjoy - faction - or fiction based on fact. The facts are the numerous biblical references (and footnotes). They're not overwhelming and blend perfectly with the story. The fiction is the story of cloning using cells recovered on the Shroud of Turin.What a great read. The book was fast-paced and a great read, well-written with well rounded out characters.I just finished and it left me wanting for (much) more. I've just ordered the next 2 and am anxiously awaiting their arrival.If the reviews tempt you at all - get it. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"I found each of the books of the Christ Clone Trilogy to be thoroughly absorbing and entertaining. Some may be a little intimidated by the depth at which BeauSeigneur deals with his topic, but I for one appreciate his attention to detail. For me, it makes the entire story all the more believable and gripping."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"I just have to say that this book is amazing. I've read other end times books, but none can compare to In His Image. The author wrote this book very well, and even had me rooting for the Antichrist. And, if you hate the French, this book will really be for you."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"I've been reading that other series and thought I understood the end times as well as could be, but In His Image has really made me think. The way that prophetic things happen in this series makes a lot more sense to me. In the other series things just happen. There's no explanation other than that &quot;God did it.&quot; Here everything works together to make a really interesting story. It's strange because even though I know what's supposed to happen according to prophecy, when it does happen, and HOW it happens is TOTALLY unexpected. I am really looking forward to Birth of an Age!"},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"Character development leaves much to be desired as the story moves along at a breakneck pace, focusing more on the events that unfold rather than the protagonists.One notable effect of this is the time and place as the story reveals itself, the thing that erked me the most was how the author uses or rather misuses time. e.g21st November 1978.bla bla bla... something happens. Then the next paragraph8 years later.bla bla bla more things happened because of the previous chain of events.Expect the timeline to progress rapidly from several days to several years. To make it a point. The story started in 1978 and by the end of book one. It's already 2020!!!The world is seen through the eyes of Decker, the journalist through twist of fate the adopted father to the clone of Jesus Christ - Christopher. I would not want to reveal the plot else this review will come as a spoiler but enuf said, the author tries to link events throughout history to come up with a probable scenario of how the end of days would be.Although lacking in style and finesse the author makes up with his knowledge of the UN as well as his background as a journalist and speech writer (There's one really grandiose speech by the UN secretary general) As you can see Decker pretty much mimics the author's life. As the proverbial saying goes writing is like going up on stage naked and slowly putting on ur clothes...I'd say, the author isn't all that pretty naked, and shud just keep his clothes on :) And you can't help but to wonder if the power struggles mimics the experience that the author has been through. To summarize, this book reads like a diary, the characters hardly stands out, but then, with the amount of action going on the book would probably be 3 times longer if character development is thrown in.Nontheless, kudos to the author for tying things up to make sense of the biblical and historical mumbo jumbo. To those who are already well versed with the bible, judaism and particularly revelations expect to be patronize by the author as this book is really for folks who don't really bother much about the historical elements that make up Judaism and Christianity.Would be alot cooler if Islamic elements is thrown in but unfortunately, you can sense that the author stayed clear of topics which he is not well versed in and focused primarily on his forte.Wud give it 3.5 but becoz of the research and gripping storyline I guess it can be a 4."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"I went into this, on a dare. You see, it is not possible for me to care less if the story conforms to scripture. I wanted story, I wanted plot, I wanted character and I wanted science.This book delivers - not as well as a similarly themed Blood of the Lamb by Tomas Monteleone. The characters while far too goody goody for my taste, we solid. The science of the Shroud and the Ark was fascinating and more importantly accurate. For the first time, someone took the time to puzzle out the age and the carbon 14 dating. That alone is worth the cost of admission. It was also nice to see other traditions woven in, it made the book more palatable to those of us not deeply Christian. I could have done without some of the explanations, for instance the detailed discussion of Messianic Jews. Sometimes the author doubts the intelligence of his audience and forgets dictionaries exist.Basic story: A child is cloned from cell samples of the Shroud of Turn, setting the stage for the End of the World.I enjoyed it enough that I will purchase and read the second and possible third books. I do however, recommend the Monteleone series over this one, for those looking for good apocoplyptic literature."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"Two years ago, I stumbled upon the self-published versions of \\"The Christ Clone Trilogy\\" and loved the premise. When live dermal cells are discovered on the Shroud of Turin, an agnostic scientist clones them, leading to the arrival of a Christ clone. Is this child an offspring of God? A replica of an advanced and ancient race? Or something more sinister?The plot blew away shallow attempts at End Times fiction--I won't get too specific, but BeauSeigneur \\"left behind\\" the competition!--and the themes explored were far-reaching in their implications.Alas, the writing and editing were weak, the presentation inferior, and the marketing limited.The news of a major publisher getting behind this trilogy thrilled me. I hoped that a good editor and a bigger advertising budget might bring this series the wide attention it deserves. With some hesitation, I passed along my cheaper paperbacks and plunked down the money for the hardcover.Yes! This book is worth every penny. The cover and layout look great. The text is much smoother. Although the professional editing could've been more extensive, it does make this book that much better; also, so as not to alienate some of the intended audience, the publishers sliced away minor profanity.I hope this new look leads to big things, because \\"In His Image\\" and the remainder of the trilogy represent some of the most gripping and memorable fiction I've ever come across. If you've never read this, you're in for some mindblowing entertainment. If you've already discovered the series, you'll love the sleeker packaging and tighter storytelling."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"James BeauSeigneur has done some very unusual things in his apocalyptic thriller, The Christ Clone Trilogy, and he's done all of them well. First on this list is that (until the third book) he gives no clue who's good and who's bad, who's right and who's wrong. Instead BeauSeigneur acts as an unbiased reporter of the events, and the reader is left to evaluate and discern the truth for himself. This makes for a very good mystery, but it will make some readers very upset as their own beliefs are so cleverly challenged. One word of advice: do not make the mistake of thinking you know which characters speak for the author.Second on the list of unusual approaches the author takes is that he has built his story so closely on carefully researched real events, real science, real politics, real belief systems (when was the last time you read a fiction series that included footnotes?), that you have a sense that you may be reading a non-fiction book written in the future and sent back to our time for publication.One final thing that makes this series so extraordinary is BeauSeigneur's use of well-developed minor characters and vignettes to give the reader a view of the global scope of his story. Unlike so many authors who try deal with global issues with contrived attempts to put the story's main characters in close proximity to every important world event, BeauSeigneur draws on a boundless stable of rich characters from around the world to give every page a full measure of realism and depth.I highly recommend these books to all."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"I have certainly seen worse books but this ranks there in my Wastebasket Shelf! His plotting and poor editing are atrocious. The characters are cliche. The prophecy seems tacked on like an afterthought. There is much better Christian fiction out there."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"This book is great! After less than 3 days of not being able to put it down, I finished it last night. I actually first heard of the book last week while browsing other book reviews on Amazon. The Left Behind series never captured my attention, but the premise of this series was so captivating that I had to check it out- - A clone being produced from Jesus' remaining cells on the Shroud of Turin? What a starting concept.This book has something for everyone: Biblical history, science, behind-the-scenes political maneuvering, End-time prophecy. It even raised goosebumps on my skin to consider how easily the political climate in the book could become reality. Very disconcerting.Anyway, if you have the opportunity to check this book out, please do. If nothing else, it would be worth the factual information you'll get on the various topics that I previously mentioned."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"This trilogy is a must read for all! I have been an avid reader of the &quot;Left Behind&quot; books and when I saw that these books were recommended in addition to or in lieu of the &quot;Left Behind&quot; series, I had to order them to see what all the hype was about. Well, I have read the entire Trilogy in just 4 days. I could not put it down. Word to the wise...you have to buy the whole trilogy at the same time AND you CANNOT stop at book 2. Book 3 is where it all comes together. I just finished book 3 two hours ago, and I cried, laughed and felt this incredible peace all at the same time. As a Christian, this trilogy has soldified my beliefs beyond measure. For the non-beleiver, this trilogy will definitely show them the Christ's love in a whole new way. I must admit that stopping at book two both for the believer and non-believer is detrimental to the growth of faith, so make sure you read all the books!These books have been three of the best books I have EVER read!"},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"I found these books disappointing. I read the first one in its entirety and thought it rather amateurish in style, although there were a few good moments (and I did like the Shroud of Turin aspect and storyline, just not the way it was developed.) I skimmed the second volume, but couldn't finish it and will not read the third. The two I read were very simplistic, I feel, and predictable, following the old, standard, fundamentalist Christian line. That's my honest appraisal for what it's worth to anyone considering risking money on these books."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"I found this trilogy by accident while surfing a website. All three books are great. James BeauSeigneur is a little slow getting each book started but once he hits his stride it is hard to stop reading. Its too bad that this book wasn't highly publicized in Christian bookstores because this is hands down a better read than the Left Behind series."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"What if Christ was cloned? While we're asking difficult questions is Christ the Messiah? These questions leap to mind amongst others in this daring challenging novel.The main character is Decker a somewhat agnostic reporter whose invited to an examintation of the Turin Shroud by his mentor and science professor. Months pass then Decker is invited to meet his former professor's adopted son Christopher. In the course of the plot it's revealed that Christopher is not adopted but a clone. While this is going on by the way the earth faces famine, and disease. Is Christopher the Christ Clone???This novel is so gripping the premise so fresh, (explored to an extent in other books, Long's Year Zero comes to mind). The author's voice though is invigorating as he fearlessly writes a novel that challenges people to think and examine their own lives and wonder science vs. faith hmmmmmmmmm? A great summer read, yet topical whenever one picks it up recommended a good Christmas gift (though by then hopefully the sequel is available.)"},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"It is easy to see why some are comparing the work of Dan Brown (Da Vinci Code) and James BeauSeigneur. Both Brown and BeauSeigneur deal masterfully with the more mysterious features of religion, politics, and science. Both bring to light amazing bits of information, which they weave into the intricate patterns of their stories. Both are highly imaginative and write with a ring of authenticity that makes for a compelling read. While Brown compresses labyrinthine plots into brief time periods to provide page-turning suspense, BeauSeigneur's trilogy is of epic proportion, covering several decades. While Brown applies the mysteries of history to the drama of &quot;today,&quot; BeauSeigneur uses both history and prophecy (from perhaps a dozen major world religions) to transport the reader from the world of today, to the very dawning of a new age.One other difference is that BeauSeigneur has taken the novel (pun intended and forgiveness is asked) approach of including footnotes in his books of fiction. By doing so, he all but eliminates the necessity of suspending disbelief. Few authors employ such strong factual grounding as to make footnotes useful, but I believe Brown's work (and his readers) would benefit from BeauSeigneur's innovation."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"I received The Christ Clone Trilogy (paperback edition) as a gift three years ago from an old friend, Lacy, who raved about the books and was convinced I would like them as well. The problem was that I was just starting a masters program and had no time to read anything outside of my course work.I put the books aside and would never have gotten to them at all except that Lacy kept asking if I had read them yet. I finally began reading In His Image and within 50 pages began to understand why Lacy was so insistent that I read them.Over and over I was totally taken aback by the twists and turns in the plot. The more I read, the more difficult it became to free myself long enough to do things like eat and sleep. The cloning of Jesus was just the beginning. BeauSeigneur has fabulously woven historic events and biblical prophecy into his story and given richer meaning to both in a tapestry that spans six millennia. His characters are rich and real, and some are very different than they first appear.I am reluctant to give anything away, but the story also includes two nuclear wars, three asteroids, worldwide plagues, destruction of the Western (Wailing) Wall in Jerusalem, rebuilding the Jewish Temple, assassination, resurrection, the Apostle John (still alive after 2000 years -- having earlier been the subject of the Prester John legends associated with King Arthur and the Holy Grail, as well as the related reports by Marco Polo)...you can see why BeauSeigneur has taken the very unusual step of including footnotes.BeauSeigneur's use of footnotes to document the factual basis of his work is, to my knowledge, unique to him and Michael Crichton, and greatly enhanced the overall believability of the books. As with the works of Crichton and the other really good authors of techno-thrillers, I found myself skimming over some of the scientific, military and political details. I did not find this a distraction, but rather, like the footnotes, found it supportive of the story's credibility.The Christ Clone Trilogy is one of those series that was written as a single story and then split into three parts (e.g., The Lord of the Rings), so don't expect to be fully satisfied until you've read all three books. If you're the kind of reader who has to read the last page first, you may want to wait until you have all three of the books in front of you."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"Whenever a novel can capture your imagination and draw you completely into the world that exists between it's covers, it is an exhilarating experience. With \\"In His Image,\\" the first book of \\"The Christ Clone\\" trilogy, author James BeauSeigneur has done just that. A highly imaginative and extremely well written novel of epic proportions, it covers a span of over forty years, during which time the reader is transported from the world as we know it today, to the very dawning of the \\"New Age.\\" The story unfolds with a ring of authenticity that makes it a compelling read, with a scope reminiscent of Asimov's classic, \\"Foundation.\\"The story begins in 1978, as journalist Decker Hawthorne attaches himself to a large contingent of American scientists who are off to Italy to conduct tests on the Shroud of Turin, long believed to be the burial cloth of Christ, in an effort to establish it's authenticity. The first two chapters are a dramatization of that expedition, and BeauSeigneur draws upon the published reports of the actual scientists involved, seamlessly weaving fact and fiction together to create a riveting narrative, much as Michael Crichton did with \\"Eaters of the Dead.\\" He uses footnotes to reference factual information, which gives the reader the best of both worlds-- documentation of an important historical event, but delivered within the context, and with the flow, of a well written novel-- rather than in the dry, academic tone of a text book.The third chapter jumps ahead ten years-- the first of many transitions that encompass months or years, a technique effectively employed throughout the book by BeauSeigneur-- and here the story begins in earnest. During the \`78 expedition to Turin, due to time constraints the scientists were limited as to the number and types of tests they were able to conduct; now, Harry Goodman, a member of the \`78 team, has reexamined some of the samples taken from the shroud and has uncovered what he believes is the most important discovery since Columbus discovered the New World. A phone call later, Decker Hawthorne is with his old colleague Goodman, who promises Decker exclusive rights to what will be an evolving story, if he will agree to provide Goodman with confidentiality, and publish his report only when-- according to Goodman-- the time is right. And it's only the beginning of an extraordinary story that will sweep you along without pause to the very end.BeauSeigneur brings his characters vividly to life, and with a depth that along the way offers some real insight into human nature. Those who populate his world are very real, and there are those with whom you will readily identify, for he presents a far-ranging and diverse cross section of humanity that reflects a number of attitudes and perspectives. There are, indeed, heroes and villains, but BeauSeigneur makes them believable and avoids any cliches or stereotypes, which gives them the necessary credibility. You'll recognize some of these people; they're friends and co-workers, neighbors and acquaintances, and some of celebrity. All of those who make up the very real world in which we live.BeauSeigneur facilitates entry into this world and makes suspension of disbelief easy, by grounding even the most extreme episodes in reality. He does this through the occasional use of footnotes, which elucidate facts, or supply the reader with context through specific passages from the Bible. His most effective means, however, is by establishing a frame of reference for the reader, in which actual places and events become an integral part of the story. The U.N., for example, is central to the story, as is the Wailing Wall in Israel. The conflicts and cataclysms that ensue, as well as the politics and parties involved, are all realistically rendered, and BeauSeigneur keeps it all flowing steadily forward with a brisk pace and impeccable transitions, through which suspense builds so rapidly that at times you will not be able to turn the pages quickly enough. There is one section involving strategic issues that gets a bit technical, a la Tom Clancy, but it affords the reader a basis of understanding that later becomes invaluable in appreciating the full impact of certain incidents that come to pass, and BeauSeigneur's approach is similar to what Melville did with \\"Moby Dick.\\" By the time the whale breaches, you know the importance of the harpooner, as well as that of the rest of the sailors in the longboat.In the final analysis, \\"In His Image\\" is a stirring, thought-provoking novel that will no doubt induce you to take pause and reflect upon the state of the world around you. Thoroughly entertaining and at times profound, it will literally take you to another place and another time."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"THE STAND was the first Stephen King novel I read. The similarities to biblical prophecy in that marvelous story are hard to miss for even the novice student of the book of Revelation. That fact played a large role in my interest in The Stand. The book is so enthralling that even when I became aware that King had veered a long way from the scriptural story, I didn't really care. And after all, no other writer had managed to figure out what all those seals, and trumpets, and vials of the Apocalypse were either.Continuing my interest in the subject, I have read a number of other books in the same general vein. Or perhaps I should say that I started to read several. The problem is that every writer that tries to stick with the original concept of end-times prophecy is also out to force a load of preaching down your throat. Their stories are less coherent that comic books and they seem to think their relationship with God makes up for the fact that they can't write.I have very recently found an exception to this rule and I wanted to recommend it. It's THE CHRIST CLONE TRILOGY by James BeauSeigneur. BeauSeigneur does an incredible job of story telling while sticking very exactly to biblical prophecy. He even blends in prophecies from several other religions! An interesting difference is that in THE CHRIST CLONE TRILOGY the antichrist/Flagg character plays his role and tell his lies so well that you can't help but sorta be pulling for him even though you know he's the bad guy. Or is he?"},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"The back cover of this book tells us that the author, James BeauSeigneur, was a former intelligence analyst for the National Security Agency, a newspaper publisher, a political science professor, a contender for a seat in Congress in 1980 (he ran against Al Gore), and a writer of numerous speeches, manuals, and articles. What this description doesn't tell us is that BeauSeigneur is a fundamentalist Christian as well. This is important to note because this series of books, of which \\"In His Image\\" is the first, is a fundamentalist Christian view of the end of the world. Some people will have a problem with a fundamentalist based view of the apocalypse. They shouldn't worry, however, because these books are exciting and about as \\"unputdownable\\" as you can possibly imagine.\\"In His Image\\" introduces us to the main character of the trilogy, Decker Hawthorne. Decker is a publisher and writer for a small paper in Tennessee when he gets a call from one of his buddies, Tom Donafin, about a scientific expedition that is planned to examine the Shroud of Turin. One of the scientists involved in the trip, Harry Goodman, was Decker's mentor years before when Decker was a pre-med student. Decker ingratiates himself with Goodman and manages to involve himself in the expedition. By going on the trip, Decker starts a voyage that will place him at center stage in the battle of good versus evil. Scientific tests on the shroud captures some dermal cells from Jesus, and Goodman clones them and places them in a woman's womb (a Mexican servant named Maria, of course). The result is Christopher Goodman, an exact replica of Jesus Christ. His birth sets off a series of events that are taken right out of the New Testament. BeauSeigneur spices up the biblical story with the adventures of Decker. Decker is hired by a big name publisher and sent to Israel with Tom Donafin, where the two witness the destruction of the Wailing Wall and suffer through three years of captivity in Lebanon. Shortly after their release (through an unusual involvement with Christopher), Decker's family, along with 1/5 of the world's population, dies in the \\"Disaster,\\" and the story starts to zoom.I am not really giving anything away with the above story description. Most of it appears on the back cover of the book. Needless to say, there are tons of other characters and events that interact and help set up the story in ways that reappear later in the series.What is impressive about this series, and what makes it stand out from other books with similar themes is the artful way BeauSeigneur weaves religion, science, history, and politics into a realistic and coherent pattern. At the beginning of the book, BeauSeigneur acknowledges many scientists and theologians for help in creating his tale. Some of the characters in the book, at least during the Shroud of Turin trip, are real people. This emphasis on real events, people, and religious and scientific themes gives the book certain credibility. When Harry Goodman discusses cloning techniques, BeauSeigneur brings in the theories of Nobel Prize winner Francis Crick to provide an explanation for the origin of Jesus.I found the religious aspects of the story fascinating, even though I am not a Christian. BeauSeigneur has one of his characters, Joshua Rosen, explain a theory about the Ark of the Covenant that is absolutely mesmerizing. Rosen brings in biblical passages, conspiracy theories about the Knights Templar, and obscure writings from apocryphal texts to create a theory that makes you nod your head in agreement, even though it is highly unlikely. New Age religions are presented as the wave of the future, through the characters of Bob Milner and Alice Bernley. These New Age elements work through the United Nations to bring about a global system of government.I guess my only concern with the trilogy is the lack of character development. It may be successfully argued that the main character of the book is the apocalypse, but there is no reason to ignore the other characters. BeauSeigneur rarely provides adequate descriptions of his characters beyond their words and actions. It is an uneven process; Decker's internal thoughts are described, but others are completely ignored. It is also difficult to sympathize with characters when you have no idea what they look like.Get out there and pick these three books up as quickly as you can. I originally bought \\"In His Image\\" without getting the others. I finally picked up the other two when I realized they might go out of print before I read the first one. I am glad I did this because I wanted to start reading the next book right after I finished the previous one. These books are so engrossing that the pages fly by at lightening speed. I think I finished the whole trilogy in about three days. Get going!"},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"In fact, it may just be the most enjoyable work of fiction, period, I've ever read. Jim BeauSeigneur shows himself to be a master at keeping you on the edge of your seat, waiting for more! His plot twists keep you guessing, even if you're familiar with the end-times. I found that I, like other reviewers here, could not put the book down.But wait! Even though the Trilogy is a work of fiction, the scientific, medical, and political scholarship is extraordinary. BeauSeigneur has certainly done his homework! And while the technical detail in the book is incredible, it does nothing to bog the story down. In fact, it enhances the story all the more.The Christ Clone Trilogy never strays beyond what Scripture tells us. While the trilogy may not follow the usual &quot;party line&quot; on all subjects, BeauSeigneur never, ever violates Scripture. In fact, he documents Scripture more than any other end-times writer I've read.The Left Behind series by LaHaye and Jenkins are great books. But the Christ Clone Trilogy outdoes even them.This book is a must-read.

The story line occurs over five decades, but never misses a beat even when chapters transition in time. The use of footnotes adds a feel of realism, making the plot even more haunting. The omen for this tremendous thriller is that the apocalypse crowd will treasure this Second Coming from a test tube and like this reviewer will not want to be left behind seeking the other two novels.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"This entry into the field of end-times stories is a unique one and stands apart from a crowded field. The author builds his story based upon a blend of politics, international diplomacy, religion (including Judaism, Christianity and New Age), finance and military action. This is not an overt Christian book, although clearly this is the passive view of the author.The characters and story line are never exhausted. Instead of spending half the book on a particular event, the author keeps the action moving at a quick rate which makes for an entertaining read. The events begin with a group of scientist looking at the Shroud of Turin. Eventually, the Rapture of the Church, wars with Israel, rise of the UN and the anti-Christ are all covered. However, the story line is VERY unique, believable and does not repeat the story of the Left Behind series.So how does it compare to the more popular Left Behind books? I have read both series, and I much prefer the Christ Clone book. It is more concise (three instead of 14), quicker paced and does not repeat the action or story with each new book. The story is built more around the action and events rather than the characters (though they are not left shallow).The strength of the story is that it is very well researched, using real people, real dialogue and real events. The plot brings the reader into the fiction, through the non-fiction, very effectively. One warning - there is some mild profanity used in the book, but it is in the context of being used by people who would use it (such as the anti-Christ and his crowd). However, there is also some thoughtful expressions of the Messianic faith in here and it contributes heart to the story. Overall, this is a great end-times action novel that will have you order the follow-ups before you are done with the first."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"Wow is this book great or what, and no I'm not gonna compare it to the Left Behind books, they are in a different category. This story is so smart and is geared toward a different audience, I finished Book 1 in one night, I just could not put it down, it was amazing. The part that I thought was just so brilliant was how Rosen explained everything about the Ark, didn't it just make so much sense? And then the appearance of The Apostle John, WOW, what a surprise. Everything in this book just seemed to make more since and fit together much nicer than any of the other end times novels I've read, and although I have pretty much loved all the ones I've read, this one tops them all, I just cannot wait to start on Book 2. I was skeptical at first that a book could really be as good as this was supposed to be but I was wrong, my review and none of the other ones seem to come close to describing this book, the only thing I can say is if you don't have it you are missing out on something really great."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"This first installment of the Chirst Clone Trilogy is great, but hold onto your seats, as the next two books only get better! A facinating story about the cloning of Jesus from cells found on the Shroud of Turin. Book one gets the story set up and the characters developed. These are the best &quot;end times&quot; fiction books I have read, and if you are a fan of the Left Behind series, you will love these books. Just a note, these almost appear to have been written for the secular reader, and not just for the Christian readers. They are a facinating mix of religious fact, actual events, and science fiction. A must read!"},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"...and the reason is, he is portrayed as a real person! I am a huge fan of the Left Behind Series, and actually think that both Left Behind and Christ Clone are equally good. But, whereas Left Behind comes from a Christian Perspective, Christ Clone comes the opposite direction: that of the Antichrist. In the first two books, the Antichrist looks and seems like a normal, average, everyday person. Of course he has great intellect and gradually rises to power in the U.N., before, in book 3, becoming U.N. Sec. General. Along the way, James BeaaSeigneur does a great job of making the Antichrist look like the good guy (which is the way the Bible says he'll come off...), and actually shows the antichrist's human sude, as he makes a few mistakes. There are actually a couple of characters that look more evil than the Antichrist, if you can believe it!As well as making the Antichrist look like a real person, Mr. BeauSeigneur also does a great job of making the plagues of Revelation look like true natural disasters (which they will be...) and shows how the one-world government will cast blame on Christians. He also frighteningly goes into great detail with all of the plagues, including a very frightening, detailed view of the Plague of Darkness (5th vial, Rev. 16.10...) which made my skin crawl in fear! The compelling story by the antichrist in Book 2 also nearly had me convinced of the origin of life, and had I not studied the Bible more, I can easily say that the story would have convinced me (at least until Book 3, when the Antichrist's true personality is revealed...). In all, Christ Clone os a very believable, very real-feeling account of the last days, with even a different view of the Rapture of the Church. In all, I am quite impressed with the quality of the writing and it's deatail, not to mention having scenarios which are real-to-life (example, the Red Horse/War as written in Book 2, concerning a believable conflict between China, India, and Pakistan...)...The only detractions that I have are that there is some foul language that is unnecessary at times, and I had a lot of trouble with the persecution of the Church (it truly didn't begin until near the end of the Tribulation, and, from what I've read in the Bible, it seems the church will be persecuted before even the second half of the tribulation begins...). Other than these, everything else is just fine...I certainly recommend this book to anyone, especially if you're looking for a different view of End Times from Left Behind. I like this series just as much as Left Behind and am glad to see a different point-of-view."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"These are amazing books. BeauSeigneur is an incredibly talented writer who risks offending those less perceptive in order to make his point. Many of those who object most to this series would be its greatest fans if they would either read through to the third book, or if they'd take the time to realize that the characters are not necessarily speaking for the author.It's funny really: BeauSeigneur's great talent at weaving his story and his ability to pull the wool over the reader's eyes is evidenced most by the objections of those who should be his core audience."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"By now you've heard of James BeauSeigneur and the Christ Clone series, but probably have not read the book yet. If you are like me, and read the reviews before reading the book, you might had noticed there were a lot of comparisons to Dan Brown's \\"The DaVinci Code\\", or the \\"Left Behind\\" series. In my opinion, the only things common between the books are the references to Jesus Christ and political intrigue. The book attempts to separate from other Christian fiction books by the science of DNA and cloning, and the political behind the scenes of the U.N. But for me, there were too much political ramblings of the U.N., and not enough stories about Christopher. The first half of the book was quite exciting, but the second half was too much back-story about the players in the U.N., this made the book uneven. My hopes are that the second and third books will compensate for the unevenness of this book.To my knowledge this is the first of its kind on the subject of cloning Jesus Christ; if you like books that are the subject of \\"What If...\\" you might enjoy this book."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"James BeauSeigneur shows himself to be a master at keeping you on the edge of your seat! His plot twists keep you guessing, even if you're familiar with the prophetic end-times. Even though the Trilogy is a work of fiction, the scientific, medical, and political scholarship is extraordinary. BeauSeigneur has certainly done his homework! And while the technical detail in the book is incredible, it does nothing to bog down the story. In fact, it enhances the story all the more.The Christ Clone Trilogy never strays outside of what Scripture tells us, though it does take some very unexpected twists. While the trilogy may not follow the usual &quot;party line&quot; on all subjects, BeauSeigneur never, ever violates Scripture. In fact, he documents Scripture more than any other end-times writer I've read.This book is a must-read. If you haven't read it, you're missing out on one of the best reads of your life."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"I've just finished the final book in the trilogy. The author has done an incredible job of using factual details, biblical prophecy, science, and a vivid imagination to create for us a very realistic portrayal of the soon-to-be last 7 years on earth. I spent every free moment I had reading these books.I highly recommend this very well done trilogy. Thank you, Mr. Beau Seigneur, for your wonderful contribution to the bible prophecy literature!!"},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"For many years now, there have been an awful lot of books produced about Revelations. The emphasis is on awful. For whatever reason, those books have often been poorly writen, preachy to the point of offensive, and completely lacking any real spiritual insight. Finally, in the last few years, two authors have produced amazing books about Revelations. Brian Caldwell's We All Fall Down is the first truly mature look at Revelations. It's not a book for people looking to stand at a distance, as it is an emotionally devistating piece of fiction. It is raw and uncompromising, a book that will grab you by the throat and shake your soul. I don't think I have ever read a book that challenged me to examine my faith so strongly. BeauSeigneur's Christ Clone Trilogy is equally impressive, if in a different way. While Caldwell's book focuses on the spiritual psychology of a single character, Beausigneur tackles the big picture. His novels are intellegent and incredibly well-researched. His novels make you believe that the end of the world could happen, not just spiritually, but intellectually as well. The two authors complement each other quite well, with BeauSigneur tackling the big picture and Caldwell zeroing in on the personal.What both writers have in common is a perfect ear for dialouge, a scathing intellegence, and an insight into spiritual matters that was exciting to read. After suffering through so many second rate novelists tackle revelations, it was an incomparable pleasure to read these magnificent books."}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:A},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:S,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},x={class:"card-container"},q=["disabled"],H={key:0},L={key:1};function W(n,o,s,u,r,i){const c=f("PoemCard");return e(),t("section",null,[o[1]||(o[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),a("div",x,[(e(!0),t(g,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(e(),w(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(e(),t("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:o[0]||(o[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(e(),t("span",L,"Loading...")):(e(),t("span",H,"See more"))],8,q)):p("",!0)])}const M=d(B,[["render",W],["__scopeId","data-v-9fc7cb15"]]),j=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotesmag/19.md","filePath":"quotesmag/19.md"}'),E={name:"quotesmag/19.md"},R=Object.assign(E,{setup(n){return(o,s)=>(e(),t("div",null,[b(M)]))}});export{j as __pageData,R as default};
