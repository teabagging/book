The few magazines I have received have been worthwhile, sparking my interest, but I have not seen the value in actually subscribing. This leads to curcumstances where it is worthwhile obtaining a compilation of the better articles, often spoken about in various litrature in the Brewing scene.Zymurgy: The Best Articles and Advice, is just that, a compilation of various articles from the magazine. It is a bit of a misnomer that Papazian has his name plastered all over the front because he is the compiler/editor (with the assistance of others) of this collection. He has not written much of the content at all, and only contributed 2 articles, and an introduction.Like him or loathe him, Papazian has compiled a wide range of very good information, faithfully reprinted from various editions of Zymurgy. Each article acknowleges the author, along with the original date of publication.If you already subcribe to Zymurgy magazine, or have been collecting the magazine for a number of years, dont bother buying this book unless you want a one stop reference to what you already have. To those outside the USA, who may not have had the opportunity of regularly receiving Zymurgy - this is a very good cross section of articles and contains a wide range of information for the home brewer.I recommend this book as a general source of Home Brewing information."},{"Title":"Zymurgy for the Homebrewer and Beer Lover: The Best Articles and Advice","review":"A decent book of a varying topic field.

NO Vol. II...it needs to remain a \\"one volume Bible\\" no matter what. A GREAT tool and reference. How to mixed with history and information that I, even as a seasoned homebrewer, wasn't aware of makes this book pure gold!"},{"Title":"Zymurgy for the Homebrewer and Beer Lover: The Best Articles and Advice","review":"I re-read this book recently and re-discovered why I've been keeping it all these years. In short, the article selection (from Zymurgy magazine, hence the title) is excellent. As your interests change over the years, re-reading articles - or perhaps reading articles you may have skipped the first time around - solidifies and deepens your understanding. So it was for me on at least two topics: hot side aeration (HSA) and yeast propagation. This book, for example, contains information on a simple chemical test for oxidation due to HSA that I don't have anywhere else. The yeast propagation article I have in mind is simple, but is strikingly clear and illustrated by a few helpful pictures.There are scores of articles in the book. Since it's topical, you can pick it up and read through it randomly. Individual articles are short and stand on their own.The book could benefit from being brought up-to-date. Also, like every book with Papazian's name on the cover, the quality of the book itself (paper, etc.) is really crummy - think cheap paperback romance quality. I've never understood this. Papazian is arguably the biggest name in homebrewing. You would think that alone, never mind the sales figures, would merit something better.

They range in time from tomorrow to a distant future.The first story, The Nine Billion Names of God, is a tale of the supernatural, yet is probably the most famous story in this volume. A Tibetan monastery makes arrangements to acquire an Automatic Sequence Computer and two technicians to maintain it. The monks are compiling a list of all the names of God so that the universe can finally terminate.The following stories tell of a royal stowaway, the building of the first space stations (and the founding of the Vacuum-Breathers Club), a wall with only one side, a future security leak, the end of the world, and the race to the Moon. Others tell of the non-invasion of Earth, the super gadget from the future, the gorgeous woman at journey's end, the most famous of novae, a strange solar phenomenon, and the coming of the Dark Nebula. This collection concludes with The Songs of Distant Earth, a tale of the infatuation of a native girl with a visiting spaceman.This collection is probably the most representative of the author's works. These stories were written early in his career, yet subsequent tales usually expanded upon similar themes. Although the number of stories about the world's end seems excessive, remember that those were ominous times.Highly recommended for Clarke fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of human reactions to advances in science and technology.-Arthur W. Jordin"},{"Title":"The other side of the sky","review":"I agree, Clarke is better suited to the novel, but he is also a brilliant short story writer. The Nine Billion Names of God, as everyone knows, is one of the best SF short stories ever written, and has actually led several people to carry out the exploits in the story in real life, so compelling is the idea behind it. Not to be overlooked in this collection, are such masterpieces as the chilling Wall of Darkness, The Star (which is also one of the best ever), and All The Time In The World, yet another great story. Also included, among others, is A Venture To The Moon, a fictional pre-Apollo account of the first manned mission to the moon that is told is such striking detail that it comes off nearly as a documentary (and a factual one at that). Regardless of what facet of Clarke's writing that you enjoy the most, there is bound to be something here that you'll like."},{"Title":"The other side of the sky","review":"While Clarke managed to keep a science ficton bond between all his stories, some were tripped up with their lack of length. The first impression you get is The Nine Billion Names of God. While it is a good first impression, Clarke can't expand as well as he is able to in an extended novel. The short story doesn't play to his abilities and the rich characterization he does so well. Other stories manage to be boundless in their explorations of science but the reader only gets a glimpse at the people who can enrich them. The fault in The Other Side of the Sky is not Clarke's writing, but his choice of medium."},{"Title":"The other side of the sky","review":"Arthur C.

Unbelievable as this may seem, between 1951 and 1960 he actually published no fewer than seven novels, almost all of them still in print and at least one (Childhood's End, 1953) widely considered as classic, four collections, containing altogether 62 short stories, and no fewer than seven books of nonfiction, ranging from moon exploration to coral photo-shooting. Not bad for a newly fledged professional writer!The Other Side of the Sky was the last of the four aforementioned short story collections and, as Arthur himself tells us, together with the previous three it collected in volume form all of his short fiction he thought worth preserving. In many ways, The Other Side of the Sky is the finest of these collections. It contains 24 pieces that range from very short stories mere five pages or so long to novellas that occupy nearly five times as much space. The range of themes and ideas is staggering and the only common denominator is Clarke's economical, lucid and powerful writing style as well as his stunning twists in the end, the most surprising thing for them being their complete naturalness (with one exception, see the next paragraph). Not even one of these 24 pieces is less than good; most, actually, are masterpieces that demonstrate Clarke the mind-bending story-teller at the height of his formidable powers.Oddly enough, one of my very few and very mild disappointments came from what may be Clarke's most famous story ever: \\"The Nine Billion Names of God\\". It is a witty and charming trifle about Tibetan monks who purchase a super computer in order to find the real name of God. It works really fine as a light entertainment - which is all it was doubtless intended to be. The only problem - for once - is the surprise ending. Not unusual for Clarke, it comes in the very last paragraph that consists of a single sentence. It is chilling and extremely effective. The problem is that it is also pure fantasy and it does, therefore, look contrived and artificial. It reminds me of the ending of Tim Burton's \\"Planet of the Apes\\". In the first moment you are pleasantly shocked, for it is impossible to deny the dramatic impact of such ending, but when you come to think about it just a little later, you cannot but see that it is utterly preposterous. I am a little baffled by the huge popularity of this story. Arthur Clarke has done far, far better elsewhere - this volume included.But before concentrating on the best stories in this volume, most of its contents that is, let me say a few words about the other few pieces of fantasy. Now there is nothing wrong with the genre itself. The border between science fiction and fantasy is neither easy to locate nor much worth searching for. I even venture to suggest that the best works lie right in the middle: pure fantasy is ridiculous, pure science fiction is dull, but the combination, if deftly handled, may often produce astonishing results. A particular favourite of mine in this collection is \\"All the Time in the World\\", which is actually something of a crime story, at least on the surface, coupled with a grand looting of the British Museum, but in the end it turns out to be quite unexpectedly chilling. Other stories of this type include the slightly less haunting and poignant \\"Transience\\", not so much a story than a sketch for one, and \\"The Wall of Darkness\\", which must be among the most mind-boggling things I have ever read, questioning as it does all generally accepted concepts about space and time. The story has one of the most arresting opening sentences, too.''Many and strange are the universes that drift like bubbles in the foam upon the River of Time.''(By the way, this is the short story in which a marvellous use is made of the famous, and real, M&ouml;bius strip. It is probably the most successful analogy to picture the completely perplexing distortion, if that's the word, of space described. See also Chapter 7 from Profiles of the Future, 1962, revised Millennium Edition published in 1999, for an excellent non-fiction treatment of the subject.)Then there is the group of deliberately flippant short stories entirely designed for light entertainment. Again, there is nothing wrong with the genre itself, especially when the stories are intentionally light-hearted. In Clarke's hands these are huge fun to read, yet not without some disturbing overtones. \\"Publicity Campaign\\", my personal favourite in the category, tells about the most unfortunate coincidence if our first contact with advanced extraterrestrial civilization happens to occur during the great hype around a cheap horror movie about alien invasion. Clarke obviously relishes poking fun at the movie industry, but he is no less merciless exposing the stupefying foolishness of the human race as a whole, so easily swayed by PR tricks. Just a little less amusing are \\"No Morning After\\" and \\"Security Check\\". The former is the truly hilarious story about a rocket engineer who was contacted by a most advanced extraterrestrial culture with a horrifying warning but he was much too drunk to take either seriously, and the latter has a brilliant movie designer who unintentionally reveals interstellar military secrets. Last but not least, the naughty \\"Cosmic Casanova\\" (written for Playboy, of course) and the royalty-obsessed ''Refugee'' are delicious trifles to read, too.At least to some extent, the two cycles of six stories each - Venture to the Moon and The Other Side of the Sky - may also be categorised as humorous tales intended as pure entertainment. Sometimes either of these is referred to as a single story, but this really is incorrect. Each of these twelve stories, albeit hardly longer than five pages, has tightly constructed plot and excellent twist in the end. The pieces are entirely self-sufficient and have occasionally been reprinted separately. I cannot but be reminded of Somerset Maugham's Cosmopolitans (1936), a collection of \\"very short stories\\" that were written on commission from the famous magazine that gave them their name. Clarke's attempts in the genre have the same perfect completeness and extremely high entertainment value. The difference is that his cycles of stories share common locale and one major character, a nameless first person narrator. Otherwise the stories are all independent gems, though reading them together does add to the pleasure.Venture to the Moon follows the first human expedition to the Moon, a joint mission of British, American and Russian crews - and all that that implies. \\"Starting Line\\" deals exactly with the international friction about the hugely important issue who is going to be the first spaceship to land on the Moon - just as \\"A Question of Residence\\" explores the subtleties, and advantages, of being the last one to leave our only natural satellite. In between there are fascinating tales about lunar archery (\\"Robin Hood, F.R.S.\\"), plant growing (\\"Green Fingers\\"), diamonds hunting (\\"All That Glitters\\") and commercials on the grand scale in the nearly-nonexistent atmosphere of the Moon (\\"Watch This Space\\"). All these were so well received at the time, that Clarke got a commission to write another series. That's how he came to surpass himself.The Other Side of the Sky certainly is a better work that its predecessor. It is set - well, on the other side of the sky; in other words, in a space station in orbit around Earth. The stories here are better executed, more amusing and with more unpredictable twists, in the end and not only. \\"Special Delivery\\" is concerned with the tricky problem of sending supplies in Earth's orbit by a machine-navigated rocket. Don't worry if you miss it: the immutable laws of celestial mechanics will bring it back - if a little too late. \\"Feathered Friend\\" is a space variation of the well-known story about canaries in coal mines. Here is a fine example how even simple and entirely obsolete techniques from Earth's crust may save lives in quite different environment. \\"Take a Deep Breath\\" is indeed a breathtaking adventure about a rescue mission that involves some fifteen seconds exposure to vacuum and real (Arthur's italics) sunlight without spacesuit (my italics). \\"Freedom of Space\\" is a gorgeously hilarious tale about the first world-wide live coverage from the ''Relay Chain'', the system of three space stations in Earth's orbit. The ending comes out of the blue, yet it is perfectly natural and somewhat saddening. \\"Passer-By\\" is a story about a space apparition of unknown (natural or not?) origin coupled with the difficult task of dating your girlfriend in the next space station. \\"The Call of the Stars\\" closes the cycle on a surprisingly poignant note, following a son's venture into space against the will of his father.The rest of the volume includes one \\"gimmick story\\" (\\"Out of the Sun\\") and two supreme masterpieces (\\"The Star\\" and \\"The Songs of Distant Earth\\"). The former was obviously written in order to explore the mighty explosions inside the sun that release enormous amounts of mass and energy, as observed from our observatory on Mercury. This normally dry and lifeless subject is superbly told, with a good deal of dramatic intensity and going as far as challenging one of the most unanswerable questions there are: what is life? One of the most unforgettable lines in the story is also a question: \\"What is life but organized energy?\\" As for the other two stories, they require paragraphs of their own.\\"The Star\\" is one of the most famous stories by Arthur Clarke, but unlike the first one in the volume, this fame is well-deserved. It is also one of the most heartrending pieces ever to come under Clarke's pen. The protagonist himself is a most fascinating creature - a Jesuit monk and a brilliant astronomer - whose unshakable faith in God is unexpectedly, and badly, shaken by an extraordinary and deeply affecting discovery, a horrible consequence of what is probably the most awe-inspiring phenomenon in all nature. Nothing more about the plot need be said. I would only suggest - if that doesn't count as spoiler - reading Clarke's essay \\"The Star of the Magi\\" (aka \\"The Star of Bethelem\\") as a companion piece to this brilliantly told and vastly disturbing story.\\"The Songs of Distant Earth\\" is a most fitting conclusion of the volume. It is the longest piece in it - well over forty pages - and, as is well known, some three decades later (1986) it was expanded into a novel of the same name. The short story, or novella if you like, has a really staggering scope in both space and time, but the truly precious quality is something you seldom find in science fiction: romance. Yes indeed, this is a very touching romantic story between an \\"Earthman\\" and an earthly woman, unfortunately separated by centuries of technological progress/regress (take your pick). The story is beautifully written, deeply moving without being in the least sentimental, and with excellent, vivid characterisation. It is a most compelling stimulus to read the novel indeed. Not often does Arthur Clarke lapse into poetry in prose, but when he does he is not a little shattering. The final paragraph of the story raises one of the most profound questions about human nature ever asked. Where does happiness lie: in the conquest of new worlds and technological progress, or in the idyllic existence in harmony with nature? The choice is yours."},{"Title":"The other side of the sky","review":"\\"The Other Side of the Sky\\" is a collection of short stories by Arthur C Clarke, an author whom many consider as an icon of both classic and contemporary science fiction. Frankly, I never agreed. I always felt that his work was pretentious - \\"literary\\" in the most pejorative sense of the word, mystifying, muddy and purposely deep, yet without clarity, for the sole purpose of achieving the lofty height of being arty.No doubt others may disagree with me, but when I read the opening story in this collection, \\"The Nine Billion Names of God\\", my first reaction was disappointment - \\"oh, oh, more of the same\\"! Why would anyone, even those with an abiding faith in their god, believe that there was some sort of deep religious or philosophical ramification to the act of physically preparing a complete list of the permutations of an arbitrarily selected set of letters? What meaningless drivel!I almost closed the book at that point and I suspect it was because the next story was only a few pages long that I decided to try it anyway. And what a lucky choice for me! From that point on, the collection was a thoroughgoing winner with everything a reader could wish for - charm, characterization, fun, pathos, warmth, wit, depth, twists, humour, human interest, solid science and thought-provoking questions - all of this without ever stooping to being either mundane or, worse yet, snobbish and superior.A few examples will perhaps to serve to whet the appetite. \\"Refugee\\" manages to humanize the British royal family in a most appealing way. \\"Special Delivery\\" explains some of the difficulties of living in a satellite and the physical implications of a jammed autopilot that accelerates a rocket delivering supplies for just a few seconds too long - a very, very small incident that illustrates the enormous implications of such a tiny event. \\"Cosmic Casanova\\" is pure space humour with an unexpected ending reserved for the final sentence in the manner of Jeffrey Archer's \\"A Twist in the Tale\\". \\"Publicity Campaign\\" is tongue in cheek and humorous but it is also a clear and scathing condemnation of bigotry and man's xenophobia. \\"The Star\\" could not be perceived as anti-religious in its tone but this tale of a very special and unique supernova should provoke more than a little head-scratching and puzzlement in those that would interpret the Bible literally. (This was probably my favourite story in the entire collection)If you're already an Arthur C Clarke fan, I'm sure you'll enjoy \\"The Other Side of the Sky\\". If like me, you were unconvinced of his right to icon status, try this one on for size. Plenty enjoyable enough that I'd be happy to pick up more of Clarke's work and give it a try again. Maybe I'll even go back and try some of his other stuff again to see if perhaps I missed something. It's happened before!Recommended.Paul Weiss"},{"Title":"The other side of the sky","review":"The Other Side of the Sky was a great Science Fiction book.

I take an interest because this is a person who will regularly actually speak of the unpleasantness of Catholicism' adherents, as opposed to the faith, but curiously of course as a way of defending it. In this regard it if funny to find a reference at the beginning to a thinker having to endure myriad tedious sermons, all as a way of preparing the reader to here another long one. Well at least this one is well written. But elegant prose cannot tone -down the insight, no doubt unintended by him, that came from listening to the fellow's words on Flannery O'Connor, supplied as a support for an effort to bring Catholics \\"home\\" to the Church. According to him, O'Connor helped a person come to the Catholic Church, but \\"after a few days\\" of meeting Catholics this recent convert was aghast. The insight comes not in that Catholics are any worse than any other group, for surely just about any organization will not stint of difficult characters after a while. The surprise was that it happened after a a mere \\"few days\\", even with the presumed honeymoon of the conversion experience. Usually it takes a while to be annoyed. That it does not, comparatively, tells us something reasonably. But that insight is not I'm afraid what Regis Martin draws, for it takes a very weird sense to draw the conclusion that such quick nausea is a profound and paradoxical recommendation."},{"Title":"Vampyre Almanac & Codex Eternal Package","review":"This book is just tripe to feed off the the \\"vampire community.\\" Virtually all of the Egyptian references have been culled from the Temple of Set's Order of the Vampyre which predates this book and the \\"vampire community.\\" If you really want to learn about vampires I suggest you look into the Temple of Set's Order of the Vampyre instead of white washed right hand path material such as this."},{"Title":"Vampyre Almanac & Codex Eternal Package","review":"Vampire lifestyle is a disease.

I've been referring to it and ordering videos from it for about ten years.Donna Carlton, its editor, updates it annually, so I've never had a problem getting the videos I order from it.The front and back covers, inside front cover, and first 18 pages consist of ads. Many other ads are sprinkled throughout the booklet, although it is divided into five main sections:Instructional VideosPerformance VideosCostuming/Catalog/Miscellaneous VideosAddresses (approximately 90, including most of the biggest names in &quot;the belly dance community&quot; Index (inside back cover)There are many illustrations, but only in black and white, and mostly of photocopy quality. Many belly dance products - especially those in print, are plain and uncolorful, which is a shame, considering how colorful the fine art of belly dancing is! I believe this is due to &quot;the belly dance community's&quot; aversion or reluctance to market, and occasional denial of, the belly dance's intense sexuality. Failing to capitalize on this most marketable of aspects, entire troupes of belly dancers spend weeks raising funds approximately equivalent to those one sexy dancer can make in one night or sometimes even in an hour! As a result, I have yet to see a belly dance magazine in more than a half dozen colors, whereas even the raunchiest pornography is rarely published in other than life-like color. I wouldn't recommend &quot;The Middle Eastern Dance Video Sourcebook&quot; as coffee table books or collector's items, but if you seriously want to buy belly dance videos for instruction and/or entertainment, this booklet serves as the best, most comprehensive guide I've ever seen in the twenty years that I've avided collected belly dance videos!"},{"Title":"Growth in holiness; or, The progress of the spiritual life","review":"This is an older book that is now considered a classic. Father Faber announces on the first page that \\"No knowledge in the world can be more interesting to us than to know how we stand with God\\" (p 1). Yes, but just how do we judge whether we are growing in God's graces or not?This is a long book, and Faber gives the most exhaustive instructions I have ever read in how to grow spiritually. He covers how we should try to make the most of whatever signs of progress we've made, and then covers what things hold us back from God. He has chapters on spiritual idleness, prayer, temptations, scruples, and how to find a spiritual director.What I liked most was how he could pounce on every single thing we do wrong. Such as this, \\"We must also beware of looks, manners...and silence, by which we make others feel we are inwardly censuring them. Nothing is more irritating than this\\" (p57).There are also excellent classics on this subject by Teresa of Avila, Frances de Sales, Ignatius of Loyola, and, of course, that all time favorite, \\"The Imitation of Christ\\", which is now available in a version for children."},{"Title":"A Biblical Theology of the Old Testament","review":"The chapters on the Pentateuch; Chronicles; Ezra, Nehemiah, Esther; and Ezekiel and Daniel all by Eugene Merrill were great.

In the chapters he writes, Merrill ties the OT text into this concept very nicely. The other chapters also have a wealth of information, but are much less centralized around a theme.

The pages literally crumbled as I turned them, but I couldn't put the book down. I was enthralled with the life of Oscar Wilde. Now, this biography isn't one written years after the subject's death from scraps of information. No. This is written by a very close friend of Wilde's, Frank Harris. In being written by someone of such closeness, it lends credence to the harsh words the author had to say of Wilde. Harris calls him lazy and slothenly. Of course, Wilde caused quite a sensation in his time. He was imprisoned under other pretenses, but mainly because he was a homosexual in a time period when this was not acceptable. Oscar was one who did not care what others thought of him. He was determined to live a life of pleasure and to make money doing things that he liked: writing and speaking. However, he did a great deal of leaching off of others. There's no denying Wilde's genius. I have yet to read any of his works except for a short essay entitled \\"The Soul of Man Under Socialism.\\" To me, the thoughts seemed profound. But Harris says that Oscar never said or wrote anything original; he merely took other people's thoughts, meshed them together, and said them in a more profound way. This is a biography that reads like a fine story. Harris is a great writer and has more first-hand knowledge of his subject than any other biographer that I've read. I'd reccomend this book to others without reservation."},{"Title":"Oscar Wilde","review":"&quot;The best life of Oscar Wilde&quot;, said George Bernard Shaw after reading this book. I cannot but agree with him utterly. No unnecesary data is wasted, no long reflexions bore us. It's just an Oscar's very close friend telling us with great elegance and delicacy the story of one he has admired and loved so much, but without fear of saying the truth. Amicus Plato, sed magis amica veritas. Of course, the reader has to know Mr Harris is the true &quot;lead actor&quot; in the story he's telling us, always supporting the Truth and the Right. But one can easily forgive him for that in reward for the great moments un Oscar's life he's saved from oblivion and darkness. A wonderful work of art itself, this biography must be read by every admirer of that Prince of Charm Oscar Wilde was. X.

Long before public figures of no talent were thrust upon us, literate minds instead of marketeers gathered around the chosen few as johnny-come-latelys and would rarely disappoint.

I particularly liked the last part of the book where Harris debates Wilde about male to male love vs. male to female love.Harris is plainly not intimidated by Wilde's witticism's and keeps to a serious vein without being rankled or becoming victimized by Wilde's ability to trivialize subjects with a veneer of parody. Among more of Harris insights is the statement that Bosie,(Wilde's \\"lover\\") and Bosie's father the Marquiss of Quennsbury are really 2 opposite ends of the same log.Harris biography seems more like a piece of literature and the life of Wilde,could even Dickens have thought up such a character as Oscar Wilde,I know Poe did!!"},{"Title":"The magic flute","review":"I just wanted to warn people thinking of getting this book -- make sure you're getting the one you want! The editorial review for the children's version of &quot;The Magic Flute&quot; refers in part to a Black Dog Opera version -- *that's* the one with the libretto and two CDs. The children's version (retold by Anne Gatti) has only one CD of selections from the opera, and no libretto, just a retelling of the story. I bought the children's version by mistake, based on the editorial review and the customer reviews (some of which also claim that 2 CDs are included), but it turns out these do not refer at all to the children's version.That said, if you're just looking for something for your kids, definitely go for the children's version (ASIN 0811810038). The illustrations are cute, and the text is written to follow along with the CD selections... fine for the age range they indicate. If, however, you want the full libretto with translations, and the full opera on CD, make sure you get the &quot;Black Dog&quot; version which is referenced as &quot;hardcover edition&quot; on the kid's version page.

I hope more books like this are on the way. This is a perfect introduction to a masterwork of opera.I confess that \\"The Magic Flute\\" is my favorite opera. It retells the ancient Freemason legends in opera and dramatic form, so you know that the story is rather primeval and sacred. I am glad, therefore, to see that someone has transposed the story for children. The book and the legend hold up well against \\"The Odyssey,\\" Shakespeare, and Harry Potter, and the story has an incredible soundtrack to boot.After all, we are really focused on the mysterious music and the incredible love story of Tamino and Pamina, and the trials that keep these two apart. The more I read and ponder the story, and ultimately its esoteric message, the more I love this story.The CD is perfect and without hiss or crackle. The book is geared for a 3-7 year old, and doesn't do the story justice. However, it is a great introduction to this opera."},{"Title":"The magic flute","review":"The Black Dog Opera Library Series had outdone themselves once again. In this 1972 recording of Mozart's last opera, we are treated to a fine performance by fine singers, a fully illustrated book with liner notes and commentary, as well as information useful in biographies on the composer and his time. Mozart was close to his death bed at the time he composed The Magid Flute. He made an opera that could be enjoyed at many levels. At one level, it is a comic, brilliant fairy tale for children, at another level, it is deeply symbolic and layed with Masonic ideals of universal brotherhood and love. Mozart and his librettist were both Freemasons, a religous \\"sect\\" that was under hot water in 18th century Vienna for its pagan origins and its advocation of ideas of the Enlightenment. The story is about Tamino, a prince who is lost in a strange land (originally, a mystic Egypt), who is rescued from a serpent by three mysterious women and promised the hand of the daughter of the Queen of the Night if he saves her from the wizard Sarastro. Together with the help of the comic bird-catcher, Papageno, he sets out on his adventure. But halfway through the opera, he discovers that he has been deceived. The Queen of the Night is the true villain and Sarastro is really a holy man. After many trials, the forces of evil are defeated and the opera ends blissfully with a victory.Musically and dramatically, it is Mozart's greatest opera. From the striking Overture to the use of dark strings, trumpet and soaring flute passages, the individual arias which express intense emotions to the neverending theme that good triumphs over evil, the Magic Flute stands out as a great opera to begin with for newcomers and a favorite for old time opera fans.In this recording, conductor Wolfgang Sawallisch leads the Bavarian State Orchestra in a highly effective, thoroughly dramatic and sentimental, full interpretation of Mozart's score. Tenor Peter Schreir as Tamino is exceptional, passionate in his aria \\"Dies Bildnis\\" (This portrait), and again as he plays his flute in \\"Wie Stark ist Nicht dein Zauberton\\" (How powerful is your music, magic flute), his individual lines in the ensembles and his duet with Pamina as they undergo the final trial of fire. Annelise Rothenberger, a sublime German lyric soprano, is moving in her portrayal of Pamina. She has her moments in this recording. Note how her high, melodic voice seems to come from nowhere as she confronts Sarastro and Tamino for the first time \\"Herr! Ich bin zwar Verbrecherin ! (Sir! I am the transgressor). Her aria \\"Ach Ich Fuhls\\" (O, I feel that happy days have passed) is the finest interpretation, full of pathos and a kind of melancholic madness, as well as her lines in her suicide attempt, finally, she is sublime as a strong woman ready to face trials with Tamino, especially striking when she sings the line \\"Tamino!\\".Kurt Moll's Sarastro is without question the best. His voice is suited for God. So divine and sonorous and full of grace, his voice is especially noticeable in the aria \\"O Isis and Osiris \\" and \\"In deisen Heilen Hallen\\"( In these holy halls). Finally, and not to be missed, is Edda Moser's incredible interpretation of the Queen of the Night. You have not heard the true Queen of the Night, until you've heard Edda Moser. She has a Wagnerian intensity and neurosis in her lines, apt and effective for the role of a Queen bent on deception and the murder of her rival, Sarastro. Her aria \\"O Zittre Nicht, Mein Lieber Son\\" (O tremble not, beloved son\\" is full of lyric dramatic passages and coloratura at the end. The vengeance aria \\"Der Holle Rache Kocht Meine Herzen \\"(Hell's Anger Burns Within My Heart) is full of fire. The way she attacks the dramatic, powerful lines is out of this world and the high F's she escalates are unsurpassed."},{"Title":"The magic flute","review":"The Magic Flute (Die Zauberflute in German) was Mozart's final opera. It was his favorite and undoubtedly his greatest achievement. When he was in his deathbed, it was said that Mozart requested to hear the score to the Magic Flute one last time. Mozart was a Freemason, although he had been raised as a Catholic and enjoyed sponsorship by the Archbishop of Salzburg for some time. His conversion; into what was a religious and philosophical organization that praised the Englightenment and mystic Egyptian/Zoroastrian beliefs, effected and influenced his musical composition. He had already written music for a Masonic Funeral and Freemasonry deeply influenced the Requiem in D Minor.This recording is out of print in cd form and was probably an LP in the 70's. In 1972, Walter Sawallisch, the Bavarian State Orchestra and the talents of Peter Schreir (Tamino), Annelise Rothenberger (Pamina), Walter Berry (Papageno), Kurt Moll (Sarastro) and Edda Moser (The Queen of the Night) put together what is the definitive, the greatest, the most perfect, the one and only Magic Flute. If you've heard the rest, now try the best. Contrary to the negative comments of the other reviewers, the Black Dog Opera Library has done an excellent job of making this opera accessible, a book full of great illustrations and liner notes on the singers, Mozart and his era. Yes, the Magic Flute has been unjustly considered and theatrically treated as a children's opera, a fairy tale with no real substance, a great work sugar coated into something like Broadway musical or cartoon. Singspiel was great opera (Mozart had tried the form previously with Abduction From The Seraglio) but unlike grand opera, it was more accessible to the ordinary people, to folks who loved catchy tunes they could whistle in the streets on organ grinders or for children to sing at play. It was a people's opera, not a stuffy, overly pompous piece of work. In a way, it was like Broadway or cartoons, simply because people could have fun at the opera. (For an example, take a look at the film Amadeus, in which Mozart is commissioned to write the Magic Flute for a more folk-oriented, Vienna lower class who drank beer and played games on stage while watching the opera, in a nearly circus like environment).Discreetly embellished with Masonic symbolism (the three opening bombastic chords in the Overture, the Three Ladies, the Three Young Boys in the Balloon, the Egyptian rituals of purification, the choruses and the Zoroastrian figure of Sarastro) are all examples. Allegorically, it was the struggle between the ruling court of Empress Maria Teresa and the supression of Masonry in Austria. This book clearly states this fact. Thus, the powerfully evil Queen of the Night, whose arias are icy coloratura, represents Maria Teresa, Pamina represents the beautiful and faithful Austria, Tamino evidently Emperor Franz Joseph or simply any good person who is beckoned by a noble human cause and finally, Papageno is the earthy, common folk who is no less a great one. This recording is absolutely the best. Peter Schreir is a superlative tenor di grazie, highlights being his aria Dies Bildnis and his scenes with Pamina, Annelise Rothenberger a lyric soprano who reaches perfection in her aria \\"Ach Ich Fuhls\\" and her union with Tamino in the trial of fire. Kurt Moll's Sarastro is poignant, spiritual, a voice suited for God, whose low F's are contrasted by the sinister, neurotic, tempestuous raging scales of Edda Moser's Queen of the Night, who reaches high F's. The score to the opera is spiritual. Nothing Mozart ever wrote could be more spiritual, full of majesty, obscurity, joy, awe and power. Five stars for this excellent recording."},{"Title":"The magic flute","review":"As someone who has studied over 20 recording of Flute, I can say that this is the BEST Queen on record BY FAR!

As well as a history lesson I received a German lesson. The included libretto is in the original German, as well as the English translation. Comments about different performances of this opera are scattered throughout the book, giving the reader depth and understanding to the opera. The CDs that are included with the book are wonderfully done. One can hardly listen to the opera and not experiance every emotion possible.

The performances are usually classic ones and though not necessarily recorded in the digital age they all sound gorgeous.

Edda Moser's interpretation of the Queen of the Night is justly celebrated, achieving not only transcendently perfect delivery, but also a chilling portrait of pure evil. All of the other cast members are excellent. The spoken role of Papageno is particularly striking, sounding sufficiently pungent to remind us that the role was originally played by Emanuel Schickaneder himself. The tempi are, for the most part remarkably well-chosen. In addition, the Masonic gravity of the subject matter is constantly respected. The chorus of the armed men is properly alarming, the cantus firmus stridently insistent above the counterpoint of the strings. Even more uncommon is the treatment of the secondary scenes of Act II, especially the chorus Welche Wonne, in which the evocation of the candidate's future \\"new life\\" is infused with the trepidation inevitably attendant upon any trial of life and death. All too often, this work, which is gravely serious in its intent, is presented as a fairy tale. This recording successfully conveys the philosophical context, and does justice to Mozart's attachment to Masonry. [The only flaw which I could detect is the inclusion of a very questionable musical fragment, inserted into Act II, Scene 11 (\\"Pamina, wo bist du?\\").

The author has the temerity to liken this work to \\"a Broadway musical\\", \\"a rollicking entertainment for the common man\\" simply because it was composed as a Singspiel, or German opera with spoken dialogue. This is equivalent to likening one of Shakespeare's comedies to a street farce. The book also suggests that Zauberfl&ouml;te was composed for purposes of pure entertainment, unless it is, perchance, a \\"work of profound insight\\" dressed up in the trappings of a \\"cartoon\\". Obviously, the writer is ignorant of the significance of the Egyptian setting in the time of Mozart, when it was a clear symbol for rational ideas and liberal politics. The details of the setting delineate the struggle which was then taking place in Europe, over the true nature of Masonry, philosophy and music, and which soon came to a terrible end, for that time at least, with the banning of Freemasonry in Austria, and the loss of much of the learning about ancient philosophy which had been so laboriously gathered in circles such as that frequented by Mozart. It is largely on account of Zauberfl&ouml;te, which alludes with precision to much of that learning, that it was not entirely annihilated in the chaos of the revolutionary and Napoleonic periods. Rather than misrepresenting this vitally important work, those who have the privilege of coming into contact with it should do all in their power to contribute to the very difficult, vital, and continuing attempt to understand it.

Craig Russell's drawing style seems especially apt for stories of enchanted lands and beings. His lines are light and airy, and he sets a mood nicely with color. In other words, he is ideally suited to illustrate this story.He does a delightful job of it, too. He amplifies all of the characters theatrically beyond the believable, and has one small advantage over true opera - he is never at the mercy of the set designers, costumers, or other effects.I am very glad to see this classic of western culture (and the others coming soon) made available in this format. I confess, I have not fully acquired the taste for opera, or the ability to derive the story from the way it is sung. I do, however, want to know at least a bit of the story, and this is a very digestible form. Russell's drawing makes it more than digestible, it's a real confection. I also appreciate the fact that Russell has adapted the story, and not created a new one from fragments of the classic.Opera buffs - I hope you can accept this for what it is. One way to look at this is opera appreciation on training wheels, a painless entry into part of the operatic art. It's also a way to spread some knowledge of this classic across a generation that might not have been exposed to the story otherwise - certainly a good thing.If nothing else, it's a well-drawn comic by a very capable artist.

Needless to say, I have never been a fan of opera. However, I was surprised that I was actually able to enjoy this book and accompanying CD. The book begins with a brief biography of Mozart, and then offers a prose overview of the story (extremely helpful for understanding!). The second half of the book contains the libretto, or text, of the opera. The original German forms one column on the left-hand side of each page, and the English translation is printed on the right. This way one can follow along with the story while listening to the music, even if you don't know a word of German. Throughout the entire book there are pictures from different stage performances of The Magic Flute. The musical recording is of high quality, contained on two disks that fit into pockets on the inside front and back cover of the book.This would be a wonderful book for anyone interested in learning about opera, young or old. However, I must disagree with the reviewer who said this was geared toward children between three and seven. A 3-year-old would never be able to read the text, and a 7-year-old, unless very advanced, would no doubt struggle with it. The book is better suited for slightly older children all the way up through adults of any age. While I'm still not a fan of opera, I did gain some appreciation for it from this book and CD. I'm sure the only way to truly experience an opera is to see it performed live (just listening to a recording removes the entire visual element), but I would nevertheless recommend this product."},{"Title":"The magic flute","review":"I have greatly enjoyed this version of the score, but there are some issues with the text. As far as the English translation goes, it isn't very good. Translating musical text is one of those things that can go woefully wrong in a hurry, and I'm afraid that this version follows suit. But the really annoying thing is that the German text has not been accurately reproduced. I noticed something close to 30 errors in the text in the first act alone. Some of the inaccuracies are simple changes that, though irritating, don't realy change much. There are a few places where it does: the Papageno/Papagena duet in the No 21 Finale shows the happy couple singing joyfully of their future progeny as Sorgen instead of Segen (worry/trouble instead of blessing). But most of the time words are given that don't actually exist in German: In the No. 1 introduction Prince Tamino cries out for help: \\"Zu Huelfe, zu Huelfe,\\" which makes no sense at all!As far as it goes, this isn't too bad a product, though if I were going to use this edition as a refrence for a performance, I would double check it against the Neue Mozart Ausgabe [...]."},{"Title":"The magic flute","review":"All the stars in the heavens for Mozart's Zauberflote, of course. But there seems to be a bizarre confusion on this product page and in the reviews that follow it. The two editorial review MUST refer to different books. Several of the reviews suggest that they concern a children's retelling of the Magic Flute story, in English with illustrations. Is this a full musical score with the libretto in German (without translation, as another reviewer complains) or a story book for children? Your guess is as good as mine, but I wouldn't buy it on guesswork."},{"Title":"The magic flute","review":"The book summarizes the Magic Flute very well (suitable for children).

I think that this edition, sold by Amazon, is quitea bargain!"},{"Title":"Treason's Harbour: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 9","review":"Some critics have referred to the Aubrey/Maturin books as one long novel united not only by their historical setting but also by the central plot element of the Aubrey/Maturin friendship. Having read these fine books over a period of several years, I decided to evaluate their cumulative integrity by reading them consecutively in order of publication over a period of a few weeks. This turned out to be a rewarding enterprise. For readers unfamiliar with these books, they describe the experiences of a Royal Navy officer and his close friend and traveling companion, a naval surgeon. The experiences cover a broad swath of the Napoleonic Wars and virtually the whole globe.Rereading all the books confirmed that O'Brian is a superb writer and that his ability to evoke the past is outstanding. O'Brian has numerous gifts as a writer. He is the master of the long, careful description, and the short, telling episode. His ability to construct ingenious but creditable plots is first-rate, probably because he based much of the action of his books on actual events. For example, some of the episodes of Jack Aubrey's career are based on the life of the famous frigate captain, Lord Cochrane. O'Brian excels also in his depiction of characters. His ability to develop psychologically creditable characters through a combination of dialogue, comments by other characters, and description is tremendous. O'Brien's interest in psychology went well beyond normal character development, some books contain excellent case studies of anxiety, depression, and mania.Reading O'Brien gives vivid view of the early 19th century. The historian Bernard Bailyn, writing of colonial America, stated once that the 18th century world was not only pre-industrial but also pre-humanitarian (paraphrase). This is true as well for the early 19th century depicted by O'Brien. The casual and invariable presence of violence, brutality, and death is a theme running through all the books. The constant threats to life are the product not only of natural forces beyond human control, particularly the weather and disease, but also of relative human indifference to suffering. There is nothing particularly romantic about the world O'Brien describes but it also a certain grim grandeur. O'Brien also shows the somewhat transitional nature of the early 19th century. The British Navy and its vessals were the apogee of what could be achieved by pre-industrial technology. This is true both of the technology itself and the social organization needed to produce and use the massive sailing vessals. Aubrey's navy is an organization reflecting its society; an order based on deference, rigid hierarchy, primitive notions of honor, favoritism, and very, very corrupt. At the same time, it was one of the largest and most effective bureaucracies in human history to that time. The nature of service exacted great penalities for failure in a particularly environment, and great success was rewarded greatly. In some ways, it was a ruthless meritocracy whose structure and success anticipates the great expansion of government power and capacity seen in the rest of the 19th century.O'Brian is also the great writer about male friendship. There are important female characters in these books but since most of the action takes place at sea, male characters predominate. The friendship between Aubrey and Maturin is the central armature of the books and is a brilliant creation. The position of women in these books is ambiguous. There are sympathetic characters, notably Aubrey's long suffering wife. Other women figures, notably Maturin's wife, leave a less positive impression. On board ship, women tend to have a disruptive, even malign influence.How did O'Brian manage to sustain his achievement over 20 books? Beyond his technical abilities as a writer and the instrinsic interest of the subject, O'Brien made a series of very intelligent choices. He has not one but two major protagonists. The contrasting but equally interesting figures of Aubrey and Maturin allowed O'Brien to a particularly rich opportunity to expose different facets of character development and to vary plots carefully. This is quite difficult and I'm not aware of any other writer who has been able to accomplish such sustained development of two major protagonists for such a prolonged period. O'Brian's use of his historical setting is very creative. The scenes and events in the books literally span the whole globe as Aubrey and Maturin encounter numerous cultures and societies. The naval setting allowed him also to introduce numerous new and interesting characters. O'Brian was able to make his stories attractive to many audiences. Several of these stories can be enjoyed as psychological novels, as adventure stories, as suspense novels, and even one as a legal thriller. O'Brian was also a very funny writer, successful at both broad, low humor, and sophisticated wit. Finally, O'Brian made efforts to link some of the books together. While a number are complete in themselves, others form components of extended, multi-book narratives. Desolation Island, Fortune of War, and The Surgeon's Mate are one such grouping. Treason's Harbor, The Far Side of the World, and The Reverse of the Medal are another. The Letter of Marque and the ensuing 4 books, centered around a circumnavigation, are another.Though the average quality of the books is remarkably high, some are better than others. I suspect that different readers will have different favorites. I personally prefer some of the books with greater psychological elements. The first book, Master and Commander, is one of my favorites. The last 2 or 3, while good, are not as strong as earlier books. I suspect O'Brian's stream of invention was beginning to diminish. All can be read profitably as stand alone works though there is definitely something to be gained by reading in consecutive order."},{"Title":"Treason's Harbour: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 9","review":"This is the ninth book in the Aubrey/Maturin series and it stands as one of the best, in my opinion, and nearly a rival for &quot;Desolation Island.&quot; With all due respect to most of the other reviews here, this book had me riveted and quite moved by the end. Maybe it has something to do with the main setting: Malta, Eqypt and the Red Sea. Some people may be bored by it. I felt the story played across the desert landscape quite beautifully. This is a gripping read, full of political and personal intrigue, great atmosphere, science (Stephen and that damned diving bell) and pitch-perfect characterizations, especially of the two principal protagonists. While Maturin is usually treated more three-dimensionally in the books, it is rare to see Aubrey as fully. Here you have him whole, and powerfully heroic."},{"Title":"Treason's Harbour: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 9","review":"A good change of pace for O'Brian. His characters get involved in the intrigues on land and an interesting side trip by sea and land. Some readers often accuse these books of dragging, when the characters hit the beach, while accelerating in action and interest once they go to sea again. This book breaks that pattern very well. Highly recommended to solid Aubry/Maturin fans, and to readers of Le Carre novels, too. Deep, dark stuff."},{"Title":"Treason's Harbour: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 9","review":"I am very conflicted about rating this novel. The Aubrey-Maturin books are a series of novels, but in fact area almost a single novel rather than a series of stand alone books. Disliking one novel is almost tantamount to saying that you dislike a chapter of a book, which is almost silly. I must, therefore, confess to feeling a bit silly saying that this is one of my least favorite novels in the series. The series as a whole is masterful, and group of books that I love dearly, and it is to be expected that some parts are to be less successful than others.TREASON'S HARBOUR is from first to last a spy story. This is not always apparent, but even the two long segments that interrupt the more straightforward espionage sections of the narrative result as they do because of a major British official selling state secrets. O'Brian's genius lies in his willingness to leave so many strands of his story unresolved at the end, and while this willingness to forestall resolving his tale weakens TREASON'S HARBOUR taken exclusively on its own, it strengthens the series of books overall.The novel finds our heroes in Malta, following the events of THE IONIAN MISSION. Almost immediately we find that French agents have identified Stephen Maturin as a British intelligence agent, and they point their reluctant agent Laura Fielding--an Italian beauty who is the wife of a British naval officer who has been imprisoned by the French and who can therefore be used to force her to comply with their needs-at the good doctor, hoping to make her his lover in order to accumulate secrets. When finished with Maturin, they clearly mean to kill him. Meanwhile, we learn that a major British official is in league with the French, and is passing on secrets to them. Twice Jack is given assignments to carry out that are compromised by secrets shared by the official. One act of treason even leads to the death of Jack's long-time nemesis Rear Admiral Hart, in rather shocking fashion.One of the amazing things about the Aubrey-Maturin series is the extraordinary number of locales that it takes the reader. One of the stereotypes of sea going novels is of a protagonist who boards ships because he wants to see the world. This is unquestionably the case with these stories. This entire novel is set in the Mediterranean, the fleet being based at Malta, and Jack being given assignments in Egypt and Algeria. One benefit for me of reading the novels has been my constant running to an Atlas to locate with greater specificity the various ports of call encountered in the various novels.In short, while this is one of the least eventful novels in the series, and while it barely manages to stand on its own, it nonetheless plays a crucial role in the series as a whole. Moreover, it contains many of the virtues of the other novels. I can't imagine anyone who has loved other novels in the sequence not loving this one also."},{"Title":"Treason's Harbour: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 9","review":"Captain Jack Aubrey was known in the Royal Navy as \\"Lucky Jack\\" in his earlier career, but he hasn't been so lucky of late. This ninth novel in the series, which continues immediately after _The Ionian Mission_ (and appears to be the middle installment of a mini-trilogy), is a satisfying mix of naval adventure, set mostly in the Red Sea, and spy story, set in Malta and revolving around Stephen Maturin's befriending of the young wife of a captured naval captain who is working, semi-unaware, for the French intelligence service. He's much better known to his enemies now than in times past, which has increased his personal danger greatly, and -- while we all know he's going to survive -- it's interesting to see how he does it. As always, O'Brian shows himself a master of early 19th century slang and jargon, and also of droll wit. The extra fillip this time is the pair's adventures crossing the desert between the Mediterranean and the Gulf of Suez, combined with Maturin's acquisition of a massive brass diving bell. And the account of the pellmell journey down the narrow passage in pursuit of a galley hopefully filled with French gold is one of the author's best extended scenes yet."},{"Title":"Treason's Harbour: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 9","review":"The ninth of twenty volumes in O'Brian's classic nautical series, \\"Treason's Harbour\\" ties together some of the plot threads from the previous book, \\"Ionian Mission\\", but leaves some of its own questions unanswered. Ship's surgeon Stephen Maturin is back in the intelligence game in Malta, battling French agents and feeding them false information until he and Captain Aubrey are sent to the Red Sea. Their mission is disappointing, though, because of a mole in the British command whose identity is unknown but who also apparently foils the mission to Algeria that ends this book.Two-thirds of the way into \\"Treason's Harbour\\", readers will finally hear about the capitulation of the town of Marga, which Aubrey's crew was besieging in \\"Ionian Mission\\". Similarly, in this book we never learn the fate of the Fieldings, he a naval officer escaped from a French prison to return to his wife and she with reputation ruined by Maturin's espionage machinations. This is a letdown, because we've spent so much time learning about them and watching Maturin considering their fates. We never learn the denouement of the Zambra mission but are left hanging after Aubrey has confronted three French vessels, this too is disappointing because the naval actions in this book are subdued, far less gripping than in other installments.\\"Treason's Harbour\\" is a good book, skipping along with O'Brian's intelligent prose and complete ease with maritime matters, but is not wholly self-contained. The diving bell is fun, but this reader is still wishing to know about the Fieldings. The plot bobs and eddies but never quite runs out before the pages do."},{"Title":"Treason's Harbour: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 9","review":"I continue to marvel at how strong a series Patrick O'Brian has created with his beloved Aubrey-Maturin books. Now into their ninth novel, Captain \\"Lucky Jack\\" Aubrey and Dr. Stephen Maturin have lost none of their appeal.One of O'Brian's best decisions was to have Aubrey and Maturin play two dramatically different roles while serving together. Aubrey is a duty-driven fighting captain, good for plenty of gallantry and traditional British heroism. In certain novels, such as \\"Master and Commander,\\" Aubrey gets to take the lead. Maturin, on the other hand, is a spy as well as a naturlist, humanist, and physician. O'Brian lets Maturin take the lead in other novels where dueling broadsides play less of a role. And thank goodness he did so, for after a few novels the stories of Aubrey leading ship after ship into combat would grow more than a little dull.\\"Treason's Harbour\\" is one of the series' espionage-oriented novels. The novel opens in the titular harbour in the island of Malta. Aubrey's lucky ship \\"Surprise\\" is in for much-needed repairs, and Aubrey must confront the extortive practices of the local tradesmen in order to get his ship fixed. Maturin must confront the attempt by the French to seduce him using a charming local lady whom they have blackmailed. O'Brian masterfully injects humor into the scenario as Aubrey tries to rescue the lady's beloved (and mammoth) dog, who has fallen into a well. Despite falling in himself, Aubrey rescues the dog, who thereafter treats Aubrey with such affection that the local gossip swiftly becomes that Aubrey and the lady must be having an affair.After this entertaining episode, it is off to the Red Sea for Aubrey and Maturin for more diplomacy. While there is plenty of time for seamanship, this mission is more in Maturin's line than Aubrey's. O'Brian treats the reader to several fun and thrilling passages, whether it is Aubrey trying to negotiate the desert on a camel, or Maturin using his new-fangled diving bell to explore the sea floor, or an unfortunate swimmer being devoured by a shark.The pages of \\"Treason's Harbour\\" will fly by as Aubrey and Maturin move from scrape to scrape, eventually ending up in a sea battle with the French. All in all, a well-rounded entry into the Aubrey-Maturin series. I only give this one four stars to distinguish it from the best novels in the series, but this is by no means a criticism - sometimes you must discriminate between the very good and the excellent."},{"Title":"Treason's Harbour: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 9","review":"In \\"Treason's Harbour\\" Lucky Jack Aubrey and Stephen Maturin continue their adventures in the Mediterranean; only this time Jack's well-known luck fails him. The story picks up where \\"The Ionian Mission\\" left off, and CPT Jack Aubrey is dealing with the refit of both the Worcester and the Surprise. In the shipyards of the 1800's - Malta in particular - corruption is rife and while Aubrey deals with the frustrations of naval command's less glamorous details Stephen Maturin finds Malta to be a den of spies, loose lips and competing intelligence agencies. Here Patrick O'Brian continues to expand and excel with Maturin's espionage activities. Significant to this novel is the introduction of a villain who spans more than one volume. I will not spoil the surprise, but he has been previously encountered to those familiar with O'Brian's series. This quality makes \\"Treason's Harbour\\" a great read from the intelligence perspective: the reader is given Maturin's knowledge and the Villain's knowledge, and can see the interaction of their various skills and chance, and how this plays out into reality.Stephen Maturin runs counter intelligence in Malta, attempting to use and save a woman who is being manipulated by deadly French agents, and due to leaks within one of England's compartmentalized and competing intelligence agencies, is at a severe disadvantage that he can only suspect. Needless to say, O'Brian's forte in writing includes both naval action and tense espionage.Soon the Surprise is dispatched on a mission to Arabia, where CPT Aubrey is ordered to attempt another minor coup similar to what he performed in the Ionian: take a small but strategic island, and through the use of subtle and well plied political intrigue and military maneuver, oust the French and their agents, ensure the installation of a ruler friendly to the interests of His Majesty's Empire and confound Bonaparte's minions to boot. Well, as you will see, all that is easily stated in war plans is not so easily executed on the ground, and the crew of the Surprise are soon terrified by evil Jin spirits in the Arabian deserts and fighting an enemy completely outside of their element.Following the conclusion of their attempt in Arabia, Jack is dispatched once more to deal with a small potentate along the Barbary Coast, who has been playing both sides in England and France's struggle for dominion. The conclusion of the book will leave you at the brink, wanting more, and racing to the library or the bookshop to get the next adventure. \\"Treason's Harbour\\" is a great book by any standards, and excels even by the elevated expectations that O'Brian continues to set."},{"Title":"Treason's Harbour: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 9","review":"Treason's Harbour provides a couple of interesting twists for the Patrick O'Brien fan. These twists involve failed missions which interrupt the continued series of victories we come to expect, yet which we know are not the stuff of reality. Captain Aubrey and his Surprises are sent on a mission by land across Egypt to the Red Sea to intercept a cargo of French bullion. We have high hopes for this adventure, as it would enrich Aubrey, and end his financial difficulties at home. This mission, however, ends in abject failure, for want of first rate military intelligence, and as a result of leaks of confidential information. The second twist is Dr. Maturin's dangerous efforts at counter-intelligence, in which he pretends to be seduced by the wife of a British officer, who feigns cooperation with the enemy in the hope of freeing her husband who is being held captive. This counter-intelligence effort is also unsuccessful. In short, even the fictionalized version of war embodies unfortunate disaster as well as brilliant victory. As usual, however, we are treated to a wealth of detail as to the operations of the British Navy during the Napoleonic Wars, and to the minutiae of naval administration. For instance, we see the corruption of the dockyard shipwrights when Capt. Aubrey has to pay bribes to get the Surprise refitted on schedule. this book will not be a favorite of the fan of naval warfare, as the only action is brief, and is inserted ten pages from the end, as in afterthought. There is also some contemporary relevance, as the action of the book is set in Muslim lands during Ramadan, and we see the effect of Islam playing through the story line. Overall, it is a stand-alone plot, and no previous knowledge of the characters or precedence is required. Read it for the twists, and shake the Egyptian sand from your boots when you return home."},{"Title":"Treason's Harbour: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 9","review":"\\"Treason's Harbour\\", the ninth installment in the Aubrey/Maturin series, is set soon after the events chronicled in \\"The Ionian Mission\\", with Aubrey, Maturin and the crew of HMS Surprise enjoying some rest in Malta, while the battered frigate undergoes repairs. Unbeknownst to Maturin, his identity as a British intelligence agent has been unmasked by a civilian official working at the Admiralty who is one of Napoleon's British moles. He finds himself involved romantically with Laura Fielding, the wife of a Royal Navy captain captured by the French, who unwittingly works on behalf of Napoleon's secret service. Aubrey is entrusted with secret orders from the Admiralty's mole which will result unexpectedly in the death of his long-time nemesis Rear Admiral Harte. And both he and Maturin will find themselves in several exciting adventures in Algeria and Egypt.I'll admit that this is not the most exciting tale in the Aubrey/Maturin series with regards to sea battles. Instead, \\"Treason's Harbour\\" works best as a Napoleonic version of a John Le Carre novel, with Aubrey and Maturin trying to outwit their French secret agent pursuers. It remains an important installment in this saga simply by setting some of the behind-the-scenes political and espionage skullduggery which will set the course for much of the latter half of this saga. Once more O'Brian shines in offering some more of his elegant 19th Centuryesque prose."},{"Title":"Treason's Harbour: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 9","review":"I truly do not look forward to reading the last book in this fantastic series by Patrick Obrian.

It will be difficult to find a book of interest after I read the last in this series."},{"Title":"Treason's Harbour: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 9","review":"Treason's Harbour is an extremely slow paced story of mild intrigue in Malta. The period details sound a bit strained--would Jack Aubrey really treat his diamond headband so recklessly? And the two minor naval engagements seem thrown in for no other reason than to justify the cover.

A nice mix of warfighting on the high seas and espionage skullduggery, both of which O'Brain excells in. In this one, O'Brian shows his two protagonists doing what they do best. Maturin uncovering the plots of the traitors and turning them to his advantage; and Aubrey skillfully and cunningly fighting his ship."},{"Title":"Treason's Harbour: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 9","review":"A highly placed traitor compromises two British naval operations to the French. Most novelists might keep the fact and identity of the turncoat a secret to build suspense. Patrick O'Brian tells you exactly who the miscreant is; the pleasure comes in observing the heroes of our story figure it out themselves. In this he is staying true to his form, focusing his craft on the interrelationships between the characters.\\"Treason's Harbour\\" is the ninth installment of Patrick O'Brian's Aubrey-Maturin series of novels set during the Napoleonic war with Britain in the early nineteenth century. (At this point in the series, the year seems perpetually to be 1813.) In reviewing the previous book, \\"The Ionian Mission,\\" which largely depicts shipboard leisure activities, I had expressed my hope that now that we had gotten the culture out of the way, it was time for a little \\"gratuitous sex and violence.\\" O'Brian does not disappoint this time, delivering a somewhat more plot-driven story with intrigue, exotic locations, naval skirmishes, and yes, even intimations of sex.The story largely takes place on the island of Malta, where Aubrey is awaiting orders. His best friend and ship's surgeon, Dr. Stephen Maturin, who also happens to be a secret agent for British intelligence, attempts to uncover and disrupt a French intelligence operation involving the wife of a captured British officer. This subplot is interrupted when Aubrey and his HMS Surprise crew are sent to capture a French treasure-laden Turkish vessel in the Red Sea, a clandestine mission about which the traitor is well aware. Later, Aubrey is entrusted with a diplomatic assignment that is also threatened by treachery, leading to a cat-and-mouse game between the Surprise and the French at sea. Silly French Navy: you have no hope against Aubrey.There's a lot to like about this book. There's the intrigue of a highly ranked French mole in the British Admiralty. There's the renewed attention to the multi-dimensional Maturin; for instance, he experiments with a diving bell he has bought, and he's depicted wielding subtle powers of observation to humiliate the (still unknown to Maturin) traitor in a card game of chance. O'Brian also gives us some flavor of early nineteenth-century Malta and Egypt. And as always, there is Maturin's masterful depiction of ships and sea battles.What's distinctive about \\"Treason's Harbour\\" among the books to this point is that this one ends with something of a cliff hanger. Most of the earlier books in the series are, while connected, fairly well self-contained. This book leaves things only partially resolved. It doesn't make you feel cheated--you do have a natural break at the end of the book--but neither do you feel like the story's ended. In a way, it helps put the subdued, interlude-like tone of \\"The Ionian Mission' in some context. The Aubrey-Maturin books are like one long serialized adventure. It's almost unfair to review them individually."},{"Title":"Treason's Harbour: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 9","review":"I started reading this series a little more than a year ago, and have been pacing myself.

It took me a few days to decide how I felt about it, but I have decided that its one of the best in the series.Like other reviewers, I agree that this series is much like one long novel, and that each volume could be considered a chapter. This is not one of the more action oriented installments, but is full of intrigue and complexity which is itself exciting. I have found that while some of the books are more \\"broadside and boarding axe\\" heavy, others are more character driven, as is this one.Probably more surprising than the activities of Mr. Wray, is the demise of Admiral Harte, whom we assume is lost in an explosion during one of the few battle scenes in the book.I suggest this to any fan of the series, but like others I strongly suggest starting with the first volume and working towards this one."},{"Title":"Treason's Harbour: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 9","review":"This novel of the Napoleonic Wars represents one of the very best in this deservedly beloved series.

Again, it's such a rare pleasure to not be disappointed by sequels - despite having high expectations.Once again O'Brian delivers exotic locations and people, interesting twists of plot, fascinating historical perspectives, and all within an utterly satisfying frame, both of the individual novel, and part of the over-story.I will say that, perhaps Aubrey-like, his attention doesn't descend much beyond Lieutenant level: while we get nuanced officers, below decks we don't move so much beyond caricatures. We can distinguish between various sailors, but they are painted in broader strokes, more likely to be merely comical, and pretty uniformly unintelligent and dissolute if not kept under a firm hand at sea.Still, even this is a mile above the utter facelessness of the crews of most fictional fleets.I do feel my pleasure is greater by measuring out these books rather than glutting myself ... but it is difficult. I am tempted by the approach one amazon person who posted on a prior review: nah, just read them all, then go back to the start again!"},{"Title":"Treason's Harbour: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 9","review":"Great book in a great series. A series one loathes to finish, but also books which reveal more at a second or third read. This is a different story, but O'brien's ability to create believable characters even at the fourth or fifth level of significance without resort to stereotyping or cheap literary tricks is still stunning. It might be a passing description of a crewman or an admiral, that once seen for a few pages, disappears from the novel, but through a couple pages of dialogue, a particular psychological loaded scene, or a simple reference, they come alive. I can't think of a writer that's developed fully the sheer number of very real personalities described in these books. Most authors toil at three or four characters, while O'brien develops dozens. This one stands shoulder to shoulder with the rest. The fate of heretofore scrub Admiral Harte at the end of the book is particularly cool and shows great sensitivity and complexity in a relatively few pages."},{"Title":"Treason's Harbour: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 9","review":"_Treason's Harbor_ primarily focuses on Dr. Maturin's role as intelligence officer and the intrigue espionage engenders, especially so here, as the story closely involves developing and recruiting a spy, and in parts reads as much like a John LeCarre or Tom Clancy novel (albeit set in the early 19th century). Added to the espionage-tint of the plot, are (unfounded) rumors of Aubrey again cuckolding a fellow-officer. From this brief synopsis, one would assume (correctly) that very little action takes place at sea. The nautical aspects of the story are closely intertwined with the espionage (and counter-espionage) which makes for a tightly-written story, although the scant time spent at sea seems to be more the means to other ends than the McGuffin driving the story.The relationship between Aubrey and Maturin also takes a backseat to action here, which is a bit of a disappointment as well. I attribute this to the sensative nature of Maturin's work, precluding him from discussing this with Aubrey - nonetheless, it is an important aspect of the series that I miss. Similarly I was a bit frustrated at the novel's conclusion - it seemed rather open-ended, there being no clear resolution to the issues of treason, counter-intelligence, the dangerous (while unfounded) accusations of Aubrey's infidelity, and the incomplete conclusion of the misson AUbrey was tasked with. This said, I can't hardly wait to read the next in the series, in order to have these questions (that O'Brian leaves hanging) answered. The intrigue (and its play on policy and strategy) made for exciting and brisk reading. As with the previous books in the series, recommended."},{"Title":"Treason's Harbour: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 9","review":"Patrick O'Brian continues his excellent prose as Captain Jack and naturalist/spy Dr. Maturin engage in intrigue in Malta. Most of the book takes place on land (many fans of the series do not like landlubber tales) which I don't have a problem with but alas O'Brians fan/critics about hit the mark on this one. The story DOES drag somewhat and the writing is missing some of the polish and sparkle of the earlier books in the series. The reader must be patient however as there are some fantastic moments throughout and, as always, O'Brian stealthily injects witty and endearing humor. I very much consider Patrick O'Brian's series to be literature of the first order and although this installment misses the mark somewhat (in my opinion), it is still an excellent read."},{"Title":"Treason's Harbour: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 9","review":"In \\"The Ionian Mission,\\" Mr. O'Brian causes Mr. Williamson to lose an arm:And a third [ball], fired as Jack was giving Williamson ordersto carry forward, took the boy's arm off at the elbow.Now, in this next novel, Mr. Williamson washes face, neck, and both hands. Actually, throughout this novel, Mr. Williamson works like a midshipman with two hands (and arms).Otherwise, this is another fascinating O'Brian novel."},{"Title":"Treason's Harbour: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 9","review":"I eventually purchased the entire collector's edition of O'Brien's Aubrey/Maturin series, and I could not put them down. I started at Book One and flew through the final book. Fascinating, wonderful, informative, spell-binding. I hated to turn the last page of the last book. It was almost as though you were actually there. You knew to expect that, if it was a Wednesday, that meant the crew would be fed salt-horse, etc. I wish I had purchased the thesarus, so that I would have understood better/sooner all of the sea-farer's jargon. One of the things I found myself enjoying, as well, was recognizing the \\"origin\\" of so many of the phrases we use today: \\"coming to grips,\\" the \\"skuttle-butt,\\" \\"first-rate\\" (vs. second-rate, third-rate, etc.) -- but there they are, and now they make better sense. An awesome read."},{"Title":"Treason's Harbour: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 9","review":"I must admit I have liked everything Patrick O'Brian has written with the except of the confused Catalans. However, Treason's Harbour is not as good as the other books in the Jack Aubrey series. It seems to be a parentheses between the previous and following book, with only a bare sprinkling of action. I did not find the story line as carefully woven as other books, but somewhat disjointed. Worth the time to read? You bet. A new favorite? Not likely."},{"Title":"Treason's Harbour: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 9","review":"This installment, like the rest of this series so far, is suspenseful, funny and populated with characters that seem very real. One new character, Laura Fielding, is admirably faithful to her imprisoned husband, and is, in general, a very likable character (and one that charms both Stephen and Jack). The Middle Eastern setting of this book is exotic and very vividly described. Stephen's adventures in his new scientific marvel, the diving bell, are both funny and interesting. Jack's encounters with Laura's massive dog Ponto are hilarious. The end of this book is very suspenseful because the reader has come to really care about the characters involved. The most notable thing about this book is what a great job O'Brian did of keeping this series fresh by bringing in new locations, characters and situations. O'brian did a great job of not letting this series fall into predictable formulas and repetition. The only failing of this book is that the very end is just a little disappointing and O'brian leaves the reader hanging much more than in the previous books."},{"Title":"Treason's Harbour: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 9","review":"Good series. Start with first book or it won't be as interesting. The series has some of the same elements, but are limited compared with the books, and put together quite differently. The author's style takes some getting use to. He uses phrases that sometimes require interpertation (foreign language, french, latin and others)which you learn to skip. Kind of skips through actions. More about the doctor than the captin. Like C.S. Forester better."},{"Title":"Treason's Harbour: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 9","review":"My opinion of TREASON'S HARBOUR, ninth book in the Aubrey-Maturin series, changed in the process of reading it. At the beginning, I was bit dismayed to find that the plot dealt with an on-shore scenario, in the shipyard at Malta, to be precise, since I have found the author's treatment of Jack Aubrey and Stephen Maturin to be pretty boring whenever he has them off the water. This time, however, the reader is treated to a rather interesting situation of international intrigue, with French agents using British collaborators to gather military intelligence. There are at least two significant collaborators, too, one rather highly placed in the government and who has fallen into such debt through his poor card skills that he is beholden to the French for funds. The other, Mrs. Fielding, believes her husband to be a prisoner of the French and her information to be the sole thing keeping him alive. Maturin, as we might expect, skillfully uses her to feed false information to the French, which, of course, puts her life in jeopardy should the French discover the ruse.Now, here we are, following this spy-versus-spy intrigue when suddenly Aubrey receives orders that send him and Maturin to sea again. Now, the plot lopes along as it always does when our characters become seaborne, and the reader is treated to Richard Russ's (real name of \\"Patrick O'Brian\\") galloping descriptions of the ship, her frisky flight before the wind, and her captain's skill at evading and sometimes engaging the French ships he encounters. However, at this juncture, the reader is also wondering what the heck is happening to poor Mrs. Fielding back in Malta and whether or not we'll ever learn her fate at the hands of the French agents. I was quite ready to give this book a grudging three stars for changing the plot in midstream and leaving Fielding hung out to dry, so to speak.However, we do get to return to Malta and resume the spy story, suddenly given more impetus by the fact that Mr. Fielding is no longer a prisoner and is, in fact, returning to Malta himself. As soon as the French agents suspect that Mrs. Fielding is aware of this and so have no further control over her, her life will be forfeit.I must say that Russ/O'Brian does follow through with the plot threads in this book and treats the reader to almost as much suspense and excitement on shore as on the deck of an ocean-borne ship. This is a very welcome change to his earlier books which, as I have noted, tend to become plodding when their story lines leave the sea. This is not to say that Russ/O'Brian ties up all the loose ends and gives the reader a satisfying denouement at the end of the book. No, as is characteristic of some authors who plan sequels, some loose ends are definitely, and probably intentionally, left hanging, including the fact that Maturin never has a clue as to who the high-official collaborator is and continues to send him sensitive data! We must wait until the later books in this on-going saga provide a satisfactory end to that particular thread.On a final note, I am delighted that Russ/O'Brian's writing skills appear to be improving. True, he still delights in throwing about nautical terms, and some nautical slang, as though he expected his readers to be old tars from the Royal Navy. Here is a lovely example: \\"Davis would give her foretopsail bowline an extra swig-off for what he considered smartness; and being a horribly powerful man with poor coordination he would sometimes pluck the bridle bodily out of the cringles.\\" One really feels sorry for that poor bridle and greatly hopes that the cringles can recover. Fortunately, Russ/O'Brian's tendency to truncate space and time and cram an action or a bit of speech against another without a decent interval, a weakness that I have illustrated in reviews of almost all of the eight earlier books in the series, has absented itself from this one. Bravo, Russ! It took eight books, but I believe you're finally learning how to write! Now, on to the tenth book in the series, THE FAR SIDE OF THE WORLD.In summary, I found TREASON'S HARBOUR to be a generally captivating read. There was the usual exciting action at sea and, for a change, intriguing action on land. The author's stylistic weaknesses were much improved over his earlier books, bridles and cringles notwithstanding. Wish he hadn't left the spy undiscovered, for I hate to end a book with a plot thread left unresolved, but perhaps that thread will be resumed in a subsequent book. This technique obviously makes for good entrepreneurism if not, perhaps, for great literature."},{"Title":"The making of an American (Modern readers' series)","review":"This book is worth the wait it takes to find it. It not only tells Riis's story of his battle with the slums, but it is also the story of a simple man's journey to America and how he fell in love with her. Intertwined is a love story that if not for history would be quite unbelievable in its romance and ending. The book shows what the faith of one man can accomplish in our world when that faith is put into action. This is a heart-warming and positive book that should be reprinted."},{"Title":"The glass-sided ants' nest","review":"And the book is an original too. This is the first of Peter Dickinson's books, and it should be read for that at least. This is probably the most unusual book that I've ever read. Picture a tribe of New Guinea aborigines transplanted intact into a London house. The chief is found murdered and that puts Chief Superintendent Pibble on the hunt in this rabbit's warren of a building, for a murderer. What he discovers as he searches is bizarre - a bowl of blood, a world where the women live in the Women's hut and the men live in the Men's hut, and strange smells to name a few. I certainly cannot do justice in this review to this highly original story, so you must read it for yourself, and be prepared to mesmerized and baffled until the dark and terrible end."},{"Title":"Goethe's Faust","review":"This was the version of FAUST which I ate up in High school, college, and the rest of my life, leaving my copy literally in TATTERS! First, the translater, KAUFMANN, produced this verse translation in Princeton University, finishing it around 1960. The New York Times loved it, and of course, it would take a lot of german knowledge, and poetic knowledge, and english mastery, to make ANY translation, let alone a verse translation that attempts to hold onto Goethe's rhymne skemes, and his sense, and double entendres. The consenses was that KAUFMANN had done this, with his translation. The German is on one page, and the english translation on the facing page, for easy comparison. How much of FAUST is translated in this book? Well, actually, just FAUST PART ONE, and the last part of FAUST PART TWO, beginning at the FIFTH ACT. (If you have never read Goethe's FAUST PART TWO completely, well, lets just say it doesnt have the STURM UND DRANG that Part one has. In fact, its filled with neo-classical wierdness, and a bit boring. But, the ending is good, cos after all... Faust gets saved, when he finds his satisfaction in life, building dikes for the Dutch. ) As for this translation, now that I know german well enough, to follow whats going on, and know poetry well enough, to see the OPTIONS that Kaufmann had when he translated, I have found at times, that Kaufmann could have made better translation choices, or poetic choices, at times. BUT, could anyone have made a better verse translation, of the entire book, which kept to the MEANING and VOCABULARY of the original? Maybe not, but if they did, just research the various translations, until YOU find what YOU like. I found \\"MY\\" translation here. The nice thing about a dual language version of this particular masterpiece, is that if you have ANY german knowledge, you can read most of the german book for yourself. The German that Goethe used at times, is very archaic, and often german vocabulary is employed, which is not found even in a very good english-german dictionary. (For example, Goethe using the word DIRNE, for GIRL. The word is unknown to nearly all germans, altho it was still in regional usage, in some areas of Northern Germany, well into the 1940s.) Other times, Waltmann's translation DOES seem very modern. After all, he was a philosopher, and had also translated tons of Nietzsche's works. So, he could read FAUST with complete facility, something that many germans today can not do. (I was surprised to learn this, but I think it might be analogous to the typical high schooler trying to understand SHAKESPEARE, without many words translated into modern english.) So, for the translated FAUST, I always loved this book, ESPECIALLY because the poetic splendor is kept in place, along with the sense.Now, a word, about the book's EXTRAS. The foreword of the book deals with the beginning of the FAUST legend, from the very eary days of the FAUST CLAP BOOKS, which told of an old, late mideaval professor named JOHANN FAUSTUS, who taught at Wittemburg University, and had made a pact with the devil. These clap books, (like renascence paperback novels) made it over to England, where Marlowe read them. Then, Marlowe produced DOCTOR FAUSTUS based on the old legend. THEN, Dr. FAUSTUS became a huge hit, and as it went back to Germany, Marlowe's work was watered down into a puppet play, which was also a big hit. It was as a child, that Goethe saw FAUST first performed as a puppet play. Later, Goethe wrote his first draft, the URFAUST, when he was in his early 20s. Goethe worked on FAUST parts ONE AND TWO his whole life, just finishing the last lines of PART TWO, only days before his death, when he was in his 80s. SO, a life's work done by Germany's top literary GENIUS. FAUST ought to be read by ALL educated people around the world, just as HAMLET, or CRIME AND PUNISHMENT, and other of the great books that formed the western mindset. The introduction goes IN DEPTH, with the way FAUST has moved thru the western world, and compares the various translations, and the various reactions to the text. (For instance, there has always been a big controversy over the brawdy language between Mephistopholes, and the witch, during the WALPURGIS NIGHT scene. Goethe had to remove some letters from a line that read, THE DEVIL F***S THE WITCH, which was suppose to read THE DEVIL FARTS ON THE WITCH, but of course, the same word for copulation fits into F***S in German, as would in English. Its hard to figure out why a few letters are missing from the German version, without that juicy bit of creative censorship being revealed, of course.) Anyway, reading the backround to the creation of one of the greatest masterpieces of human creativity, is well worth every page devoted. How many pages might that be? The intro lasts about 50s pages. THEN, we get right into the bilingual FAUST PART ONE, and ending of PART TWO. Even now, reading the german, and then the english, I find both fascinating, and impossible to put down. FAUST is a blast to read, unlike Homer, or Virgil. Goethe had a VERY modern mind, and so he still amuses. If anyone is bilingual in German and english, but has ENGLISH has their mothertongue, you MUST read Faust with the German and English side by side. This way you wont need to look thru huge GERMAN dictionaries, to find the rare words, and archaic meanings. You get SO MUCH MORE of the poetry, the depth and mastery of language, when Goethe is given his due, by reading FAUST in german. Even if you DONT know german, the original german language STILL sounds so beautiful, as you read it.AND ONE LAST CONSIDERATION! Since my book has literally fallen apart, I went to AMAZON to find another bilingual edition. Unfortunately, THIS IS IT! (As far as I could find, at least.) You buy this book and enjoy it, or just forget it, and buy a German version, and an English version, and try to get them to line up, as well as another book for introductory information. Kaufmann's translation of GOETHE\\"S FAUST is not just ONE book, but THREE BOOKS for the price of one. I dont know WHY there are no bilingual versions of FAUST. I can only surmise, that since German is rarely offered in High schools, and colleges, that there is no demand. Not only that, but bilingual books that ARE produced, dont try to give us such difficult literary works, but rather, \\"easy modern novels\\" in bilingual versions. ITs sad. So, do you want to try and read FAUST in German, but need a helping hand, for the rough parts? HERE YOU GO. (Haben Sie Mut! Sie Koennen es tun.) Alles Gute!"},{"Title":"Goethe's Faust","review":"First, about having Part I complete in this volume, my praise will be short, simply that it is terrific to have the whole of Part I available, with the original German and Kauffmann's English translation facing each other.

I should first note that I've never read any other version besides Kaufmann's, so in that sense, I literally do not know what I've missed. (I've heard a live radio version from the BBC, which had more context in Part II, to be sure.) While I can accept the commentary from Kaufmann that Part II is overlong and could do with trimming for more general readers, just by my own gut feeling here, Kaufmann cut too much. Even with Kaufmann's very concise summary of the missing sections in the foreword, from reading these selections from Part II, in this version, it feels much too short and without any context. I could easily have dealt with twice as much more material to give a little more context for Part II. Maybe Part II is so sprawling that there is no context as such, but I just really felt short-changed in reading these selections from Part II. There's nothing wrong about the quality of Kaufmann's translations, not at all. It's just that Part II, a little more would not have gone amiss.So if you're going to buy this, please be aware of what you'll get, namely Part I in all its glory, and Part II in much rather less than that, even with the famous final scene included intact."},{"Title":"Goethe's Faust","review":"First, about having Part I complete in this volume, my praise will be short, simply that it is terrific to have the whole of Part I available, with the original German and Kauffmann's English translation facing each other.

I was riveted by the frankness and the seriousness of the safety and a few other chapters in this book, But on a whole it is better suited to the large bore african hunting safari big game buff.I being the owner of rifles which are lighter in calibre than what the A-Square company specialises in put me at a distance to what the Authors talk about at times. The subject of bullet expansion was fasinating but also the likelyhood of me using a monolithic solid projectile on varmints is highly unlikely.I though at first that this would be an excellent read but it started to wain in it's appeal after the Authors spoke about Terminal Ballistics and there after Bullet Expansion and Sighting in a Rifle.

He ran the Army's Jefferson Proving Grounds and taught weapon science at West Point where he got his engineering training, I'm sorry but that's far more impressive to me than a writer who hunts every chance he can get, owns a cheap chronograph, and reloads a few calibers in the basement that seem to underlie so much of what we read or hear about cartridge performance.

I bought these books of the kid's version because I read the Adult version long ago and was mainly curious about the kid's version. Then I thought to myself, why not order all of them and read them, then start passing them out to all my grandchildren. One thing I don't agree with about the description of these books, it says for 9 years old and up, but I think it would have to be a very mature 9-11 year old to really understand these books. I would say they were more fitting for 13 years old to adults. Saying all of this, the only problem I had with this particular book was that at first it was listed at a lot higher price on Amazon. So I started searching on the Web for a cheaper copy and found out this was a very rare book and some sites wanted as much as $222 for a used copy of this book!! Now I wouldn't even pay that much for a new copy, and I sure would not pay that much for a used one. Finally Amazon had another seller who sold it for a little cheaper, can't remember now how much I finally got it for, but seemed like it was around $25 with the shipping--still way too much for a used copy. Even brand new they did not cost this much when they first sold.

I just wish the kids weren't written like there to good. For instance, when the heat wave is over, and Judd tells Vicki he's going to stay in New Babylon, she gets all worried, but then Judd tells her that he feels that God wants him to do more in such a dangerous place, I just don't see how anyone would want to stay in such an aweful place even if there are people that need to be saved. I would think that he would want to get out as soon as possible, especially if he's going to get married soon. I would think he would want to go get married and get to safety as soon as possible and not wait around."},{"Title":"The Perils of Love (Left Behind: The Kids, No. 38)","review":"product came in quickly and i am completely satisfied with it.

The kids books are just as good. The kids interact with the characters from the adult series, experience the same events, etc. However, since the main characters are teens, these books can appeal to younger readers. So far, the stories haven't had the ups and downs that the adult series has had. The adult series has books that are a lot more boring than others. The kids series seems to be good in every book. These are not for really young kids, but would be appropriate for young teens.

His grandmother wants him to come home so she can force him to marry and join his manor with a neighboring one.

Lose the hot pink type on white background, please!!! Egads!"},{"Title":"Hermit of Eyton Forest","review":"This book was dull, boring, had a slow start but had a thrilling ending"},{"Title":"Hermit of Eyton Forest","review":"As with several other entries in the Chronicles of Brother Cadfael, at the center of this book stands one of the younger members of the community of the Abbey of St. Peter and St. Paul, and his relationship to the community versus his romantic relationships in the world outside. But this time the youngster isn't a novice who made a mistaken commitment to the cloister after a love affair gone wrong, nor even an embittered older man seeking solace after a disastrous marriage.No, Richard Ludel (his father's namesake and only child) is ten years old, doesn't yet see any use for girls, and is happy enough to be one of the handful of students boarded at the monastery, well away from his formidable grandmother's plans to marry him off to the heiress of a neighbouring manor - \\"quite old\\", being past twenty, and a nuisance rather than a person from Richard's point of view. This makes an oblique, fairly subtle contrast to the events of the ongoing civil war between the empress and the king - the empress, like Richard's intended, is years older than her husband, tied to him in a marriage with little love lost, as demonstrated when Geoffrey of Anjou not only refuses to send so much as a single soldier to her aid while she is under siege in Oxford, but has lured away her half-brother and best general to help *him* with the battles for the Norman lands in contention in the struggle for the throne.Upon the death of the elder Richard Ludel (still young, but never recovered from wounds suffered in the battle of Lincoln), Richard's elders plan to let matters proceed according to their settled routine - but there's a disagreement about what that routine is. Hugh Beringar as sheriff has no wish to antagonize the loyal Ludels by interfering with Richard's inheritance, despite his being a minor; his only concern is that the Ludels' steward should be competent and loyal. Abbot Radulfus (by charter the boy's guardian until he comes of age), intends for the boy to stay in school - as Radulfus objects to children being handed over as infant oblates into monastic vows before they can consent, he also objects to children being bound in marriage, without any designs on pressuring the boy into becoming a monk. But Dame Dionisia Ludel's idea of the status quo is to continue with her campaign to marry the boy off, beginning by playing on public sympathy for a poor bereaved widow, cruelly kept from bringing her grandson home for a visit (and backing it up with judicious threats of taking the abbey to law).Even as Dame Dionisia piously installs the hermit Cuthred in a long-empty hermitage in Eyton forest - who unlike the brothers of Shrewsbury would be under vows to remain solitary and enclosed in his hermitage, with only a youngster acting as his errand boy for regular company - the lady at first seems piously resigned, though she sees no use in having him educated and a *lot* of use in getting the neighbouring manors of Wroxiter and Leighton joined with the Ludel's manor of Eaton. Curiously, events then seem to conspire against the brothers, as accidents become disturbingly frequent in the abbey lands near Eaton, and the hermit (through his errand boy, the mischievous Hyacinth) issues a public warning to the abbey that perhaps these signs of nature in revolt should be taken as a sign that Richard should not unnaturally be kept away from his only remaining blood kin.Despite this, young Richard immediately takes to Hyacinth, after waylaying him upon Hyacinth's delivery of the message, and the much older Hyacinth is happy enough to give Richard all the information his elders have been withholding from him, in exchange for being put in the picture about Richard's own situation. So when Richard later overhears an abbey guest in pursuit of a runaway villein being informed that Hyacinth matches the runaway's description, he immediately sets out for the hermitage at Eyton to warn his friend, naturally leaving no word at the abbey that he's playing truant, let alone venturing into his grandmother's reach.But Richard fails to return to the abbey (and as his fellow students cover up for him into the next day, his absence isn't discovered until many hours have passed). Well aware of Dame Dionisia's plans for the boy, the lands in her care are searched thoroughly - but with no trace of the boy, and as the manor folk are more loyal to the boy than to her, it's hard to see where he could've been hidden - or how he can be rescued before being browbeaten into saying vows and signing marriage settlements.As always, I recommend the unabridged recording narrated by Stephen Thorne. And as usual in Cadfael novels, there *are* love stories amid the pair of loveless arranged marriages for joining lands and titles featured in the story of the civil war and the private war over Richard's future. My congratuations to the reader who manages to spot *all* the puzzles to be solved, and not to be distracted by the enjoyable drama and romance that accompany them. Not least, one of the most dramatic episodes of the war - King Stephen's siege of Oxford, with total victory almost within his grasp as the empress is trapped within the castle - is playing out as the people of Shropshire are concerned with events nearer home.Drive-in totals:- Three disappearances (counting the mystery of the missing villein, being hunted ruthlessly by his former masters).- Three deaths (counting Richard's father).- Three love stories (the most dramatic of which is played out entirely off-stage, but no less affecting for that)."},{"Title":"Hermit of Eyton Forest","review":"In October of 1142, Empress Maud is still besieged in the town of Oxford, surrounded by the forces of King Stephen. She sends an emissary bearing jewels and money to her brother, begging him for help, but the man's horse is found with the leathers bloodstained and, of course, with no sign of the money or jewels. A local Lord and father of Richard, one of the young pupils at the Abbey of St.Peter and St.Paul dies and Brother Cadfael is charged with the duty of escorting the boy to his home to attend the funeral. The boy's grandmother, a harsh and grasping woman, wishes to force Richard into a marriage with an older girl, the daughter of a neighbour, so that the lands may be conjoined, but the 10 year old wants only to return with Cadfael to the Abbey and his friends. A minor, local landowner stays as a guest at the Abbey while mounting a search for his missing villein and enlists the reluctant help of Sheriff Hugh Beringar who agrees to help with the search, knowing that the man is a brutal master who treats his servants very badly. A series of events causes Richard to be kidnapped and forced into a marriage by his grandmother and Cuthred, a local hermit and holy man. Yet another stranger arrives at the Abbey with a slight wound and so is taken to be treated by Cadfael who makes his usual assessment of all the events and uses his insatiable curiosity to tie all the loose ends together for a very satisfactory conclusion."},{"Title":"Hermit of Eyton Forest","review":"THE HERMIT OF EYTON FOREST is another installment in Ellis Peters' popular Brother Cadfael series. I've read most of them and fully intend to read the rest. Clearly, I'm something of a fan. Not because the mysteries are so riveting. They aren't. In fact, most of them are fairly transparent. The how and why might not always be so obvious, but the who isn't usually too hard to figure out. The suspicious characters are rarely difficult to identify.Further, the picture Ellis paints of life in the eleventh century is sanitized for our enjoyment. Despite the violence of the civil war raging in the background, life in Shrewsbury is slow-paced, calm, and ordered. Filth, squalor, brutality, disease and the appallingly short life expectancy of the period rarely intrude here.Despite this (or perhaps because of it), the stories are engaging, the characters charming, and Peters' idyllic vision of the time is very attractive. Her prose has an elegant, graceful quality that enhances the pleasure of the overall experience, making these books a delight to read. I never fail to enjoy them, and THE HERMIT OF EYTON FOREST is certainly no exception."},{"Title":"Hermit of Eyton Forest","review":"The fourteenth Cadfael book I have read and it was as enjoyable as the first thirteen. I admit that some of the plots have been predictable, but this is easily overlooked because Peters does such an expert job at bringing the 12th century to life, and Cadfael is such an entertaining character.This particular installment happens to be one of the better mysteries in the series. Like the previous thirteen, it is a well-written and finely crafted story, but there are also some clever surprises. It is a cut above the average Cadfael book, but doesn't quite reach the five star qualities of the first two (Morbid Taste for Bones and One Corpse Too Many) that are true mystery classics."},{"Title":"Hermit of Eyton Forest","review":"This is number 14 in the Cadfael series by Ellis Peters. In this book, with the 12th century English civil war in the background, several unhappy events take place in and around Shrewsbury and beyond. Peters fits these seemingly unrelated events together for readers making for a good story.As the book opens, the Lord of Eaton finally dies due to battle wounds; his son and heir named Richard is ten years old and in school at the abbey in Shrewsbury. The boy's grandmother is determined to take him home and marry him off right away to a neighbor who has only a daughter and very good lands. She is thwarted in her plans by the abbot, since the boy was put into his charge by the boy's father who wanted him educated.At the Lord of Eaton's funeral, readers get the first glimpse of the hermit for whom the book is named. The grandmother installs this hermit in a small dwelling in a forest on Eaton land. Soon after, some disasters take place nearby on abbey land which are reported to the abbot. Not long after this, the hermit's servant appears at the abbey to announce that the hermit believes the disasters are God tying to tell the abbot to send Richard back to his grandmother. The abbot is not convinced.Somewhere around this point in the book, news concerning some treasure of the Empress Maude's that has apparently been stolen comes to Shrewsbury. The messenger carrying this treasure is presumed dead given the condition of his horse when found. This turns out to be very important in the story.A very unpleasant man named Bosiet shows up to lodge at the abbey. He is in search of a bondman of his who has run off - apparently for good reason. Bosiet shows up dead in the forest not long afterward. It looks like the hermit's servant is the missing bondsman.The servant has made friends with the boy Richard. The boy finds out that Bosiet is heading off to find the servant, so he goes off to warn him, and does so, but disappears on the way back to the abbey. A massive search is started for the servant now suspected of the murder and for the boy.As the story progresses, the boy is found, the hermit is killed and the mystery of the missing treasure is solved. The details are left out here so as not to spoil the plot.I figured out what happened before it was actually revealed by the book, but only about a page or so beforehand. It is always exciting when that happens. I mean figuring it out ahead of time, but only at the last moment, so the book was indeed worth finishing.Cadfael played a major part in this book, but he was not involved in several scenes. This may be why this book was not used for the TV series, which is a shame because it tells a very good story.Anyway, if you like the Cadfael series, certainly give this one a try."},{"Title":"Hermit of Eyton Forest","review":"Many a twist and turn - no one is who they seem. The ending may be too neat and tidy, but still a great cast of characters and Peter's charming telling make this a good read."},{"Title":"Hermit of Eyton Forest","review":"Richard Ludel inherits his father's estate at the age of 10. The boy has lived at the Abbey of St. Peter and St. Paul since he was five years old, and he hardly knows either his father or his overbearing grandmother, from whom the widowed elder Ludel wanted to shield his son. That is why young Richard is being schooled at the Abbey, and it's also why his father appointed Abbot Radulphus to become the boy's guardian in the event of the father's death. But Richard's grandmother loses no time, after her son's death, in trying to gain both legal control over and physical custody of her grandson. She threatens the Abbot with legal action, when Radulphus makes it plain that he intends to fulfill the wishes of the boy's father - which were that Radulphus continue as his guardian until Richard comes of age, and that Richard continue to live and study at the Abbey.Dame Dionisia has taken up patronage of a hermit recently arrived in the area, a man called Cuthred. Cuthred also urges Abbot Radulphus to turn young Richard over to his grandmother, sending his \\"boy\\" - actually a young man of about 20, called Hyacinth - to deliver his opinion on the matter. On his way back to Cuthred carrying the Abbot's reply, Hyacinth rescues the Abbey's forester from where a falling tree has pinned the man in a rising stream. Hyacinth promptly falls in love with the forester's daughter. The young man answers all too well to the description of a fugitive serf being sought by his angry master, who calls on Lord Sheriff Hugh Beringar to find and return the fugitive. Riding out alone to investigate the matter for himself, the master instead winds up murdered. At which point Brother Cadfael, already intrigued by the mysterious Hyacinth and sharing his abbot's concern about Richard, begins trying to put the puzzle together - only to be faced with another and more urgent mystery when Richard vanishes. Has his grandmother kidnapped him? And if so, can his friends find and rescue the boy before his grandmother can force him into marriage with an heiress more than a decade his senior?As usual in the later Cadfael books, medieval politics provides much of the story's background and part of its framework. Ellis Peters does a superb job of writing children as they really are, not as adults sometimes fondly wish they might be. Young Richard is entirely believable, and sympathetic without being the least bit saccharine. The plot's final twist also works well.

Without it, the mystery would not stand, and by far that makes the telling the weaker. There are several nice twists to arrive at a conclusion but that we need something that touches the war between Maud and Stephen seems a stretch once again.Ellis is gone and Cadfael shall have no new mysteries in the canon, but with the knowledge of others in the field, the violent times of the dark ages should more than lend itself to murders without the need for princes and kings. The Abbey and Shrewsbury have more than an abundant wealth of detail that we have seen previously to support a rich environment for mayhem.This story and the mystery seem to stem from just such an environment, but the murders that come about end up being related once more to our civil war and the impetus of life going on in spite of such a war is denied."},{"Title":"Hermit of Eyton Forest","review":"I am a Brother Cadfael junkie.

It is written by a master craftswoman with a first-rate imagination, who creates characters which spring to life off the pages and embed themselves into the psyche like a tapeworm.This is the classic love story, never done better. The pathos, tension, drama, dilemmas are all there, done with a classiness that outlines both and yet, somehow, keeps itself above pandering, sniveling, or whining. After seeing the wonderful classic film based on the book, and remembering it so well, somehow exploring the book was never made a priority. Word to the wise: MAKE it a priority! There are layers and sub-plots not covered by the film, which, along with Bronte's words, add so much to the understanding of the film and to the interactions between Rochester and Jane.Jane Eyre is one of the most intriguing and memorable women in literature. To be privileged to be inside her mind and privy to her thoughts is a great gift.

The idea that one could create software objects directly at runtime, without classes, by piecing together data and behavior was very interesting to many, but somehow lost in the mad rush towards C++ and Java. JavaScript is one of the few prototype-based languages that survives in widespread use, yet it is really just a poor step-cousin to direct manipulation-based prototype languages like Self.This book is a collection of papers (some of which are hard to find via other channels) that provide a good overview of the field. Philosophy, implementation techniques, and esoterica, it is all here. I suspect that we may find one day, as Integrated Development Environments become more powerful, that the idea of prototype-based development should be revisited. If you are a programming language researcher, designer or enthusiast, this book is a very good place to begin learning about prototype-based development."},{"Title":"I Want to Marry Godzilla and Have His Children","review":"In the end Zoey doesn't marry the stomper of Tokyo; although, he comes off as more sympathetic than the men Zoey cares about.

Each entry provides space for the brand and size of cigar, where purchased, cost, time and date smoked, your rating, last meal eaten and time (I don't use this one, but it's a nice touch), wrapper color, your comments, and the cigar's band to be pasted. There's also a page on which you can list your favorite cigars and tobacconists, then a few more pages for your notes. It's nicely bound in a black hardcover with gold embossed letters. The pages are cream colored with soft burgundy print.If I were asked to improve this book, I would add a block to each entry in which to record the country where the cigar is made.

Meditation is not about religion, it is about spirituality- there is a huge difference. We ( as a society) are not taught to look within for the answers in our lives. We constantly bombarded by the outside world. Meditation is about slowing down, learning how to breath and getting quiet with the self. This book provides a quick and easy technique.

Then Eragon by Christopher Paloni is the right book for you. The book starts out at a shrine where few people go. Eragon is a young boy who at the shrine found a diamond hard blue rock. He takes it home. The next day the rock bursts and out pops a dragon. Galabortrix, the evil king wants the dragon because it is the last female dragon alive. The main characters in this book are Eragon, Saphira, and Galabortrix. In this book I loved it how the author described how aghast Eragon was when Saphira's egg hatched. I also loved it how he describes Saphira. I like it because it is funny. I would recommend this book for good readers ages 9-15. I would recommend this book because it has a lot of action and adventure. Eragon is the perfect book for fantasy lovers. So if you want a book that you just won't want to put down, read Eragon."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Eragon was a very original book.

I would like to congradulate Christopher Paloini.I recommend this book for people that like adventure, fantastic creatures, and very interesting and exiting plots. The people that read this book must keep in mind that there are a lot of names to memorize, but you'll enjoy it even so! (You might not, if you don't really understand the beauty of suspense, the pleasure of exitement, and the taste of adventure).If you are of the kind that grabs a good book and sees it as one, understands the complexity of rich language, and is ready to take that book everywhere, that book might just be \\"Eragon\\".It really doesn't matter what age you are, so long as you can read and understand a few complex and hard terms that might pop up.

The story line wavred at times, and was confusing, but the plot was well planned, in my opinion.

He finds out that it really is an egg, a dragon egg, when it hatches and out comes a dragon. He names her Saphira. Over time the dragon grows, bigger and bigger. One day, Eragon comes home to find his home destroyed and his uncle killed. He finds out that it was caused by the Ra'zac, people who work for the king and the empire. Eragon sets out to avenge the death of his uncle, but he is joined by Brom, the village storyteller, who found out that he had a dragon. While following the Ra'zac's tracks, he trains both physically and magically. Soon Eragon's battle turns into an all out war against the king and the empire. Friendships are made, and alliances are tested, as the only ones who can help, Eragon and Saphira, are clueless as to how. They soon learn that the Varden, a group of humans and dwarfs will be able to help them. But to get there they must cross a huge desert. Will they survive while crossing it?I liked this book for many reasons. One, my copy of the book had a map, so I could follow Eragon's trail. There were also some Czech based words, which in the book was used as the \\"ancient Language\\" that summoned magic, but there was a huge glossary in the back that you could check. Another reason I liked Eragon was that the book was really full of questions and answers. In this way it was suspenseful.

Also, when I was reading this book I thought if Christopher could get this published it would not be so hard to break into publishing. Then I discovered his parents have a publishing company. So basically he did not even have to worry about getting published. His loving 'mom and dad' would make sure he did get published. So I'm thinking that's how he got this awful book published.I hope he dosen't even write a 3rd Eragon book [I would hope he wouldn't write a sequel but that's to late now].

I do not know how they compare to other popular books yet, but I am impressed with this one. After I finished this book, I could not wait to get my hands on the next one. It took me several days to finish and I hated to say goodbye to it ( I wish I could forget the story and reread it again).

Yes, there are many similarities, but on the whole, the story is very original and, most importantly, wildly entertaining and engrossing. The book pulls you in from the very first paragraph of the prologue, when we are introduced to a character called a Shade (can't wait to see him in the movie) who is chasing after an elf in possession of some sort of precious stone. The meaning and purpose of the stone can be found within the amazing 497 pages of this book. The characters are great and you find yourself either rooting for them, crying for them, or hating them (in a good way). The best part about this book is that it is only the first of a trilogy, and its author is only 21 years old, so there is much more to come from Paolini. Quite simply, if you are a fantasy fan, you cannot go wrong with Eragon. It is destined to be a classic."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This book is very fun to read!

I got this book for my husband because he likes fantasy, but found myself reading, unable to put it down. The first several pages are very good at drawing you in. The action does get a little predictable. Also what I didn't like is that, even though I know many people use other author's ideas, I started wondering if this kid read the Tolken books a few too many times. From start to finish I could see where the Tolken books were an influence. Maybe he didn't mean for it to sound like that, I don't know. Also, I did find myself wanting more interaction with the boy and the dragon, they are the main characters, and yet for most of the first half of the book they don't even talk to each other much, let alone enteract with each other. All in all I thought it was a good book."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Eragon is unique, and it is extremely hard to stop reading. This is Christopher Paolini, who was fifteen when he wrote this story, first book. Also, Eragon is the first book in the trilogy, which is a lot like Terry Brooks' Shannara collection. In both, there are mystic elves, stout dwarves, mighty dragons, and powerful magic.Eragon, a youthful farm boy, while hunting in a dangerous mountain range, stumbles across a wonderful blue rock. Thinking to sell or trade it to help his family through the harsh, northern winter, Eragon keeps the stone. Before he gets the chance to sell it, it hatches something thought to be extinct... a sapphire-blue dragon! Eragon develops a mental connection with the dragon, and when the murdering Ra'zac kill his uncle, he leaves his village only to find out that he is the first of the new generation of Dragon Riders. The Dragon Riders were the peacekeepers of Alagaesia Eragon is fated to be the one to turn the tide of the coming war to overthrow the cruel king, Galbatorix. Eragon and Saphira, his dragon, set out to find their way through the darkness, constantly growing in strength and knowledge.Though this novel is exceptionally interesting, it is sometimes hard to understand, but Christopher Paolini has already taken care of that. There are maps, glossaries, and definitions within the book to help you along the way. Eragon is definitely for fantasy readers, ages twelve and up.

However, there are some major issues that need to be addressed when giving this book an point-by-point review.1. Paolini seems to have read the same fiction I have, most significantly the Wheel of Time series by Robert Jordan. Much of Paolini's begining plot was lifted almost directly from this epic; Boy of important but undisclosed heratage (an orphan) brought from far away to a simple village where he was raised by someone who is harmed because of his connection to him, must flee along with mysterious magic user/mentor/trainer etc. Many of the names are echoed as well, \\"Therinsford\\" in Eragon from the name of a main character in Wheel of Time (Lews Therin, anyone?) and creatures are duplicated from other works (e.g. Jordan's trollocs play a central role in the final bit of Paolini's book) etc. Names and words echo those in JRR Tolkien's Lord of the Rings. Paolini does not distance himself far enough from these base works of fantasy fiction.2. Language. Paolini did not revise his book extensively enough--you can watch his skill with dialog grow as the book progresses; he should have gone back and fixed the awkward phraseology in the introductory chapters.In summation, this was a good attempt, but further effort must be made to distance future works from the craftmanship of other authors."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This is a great book, Nothing like the Movie. The Book is a lot more indepth and a lot of blanks filled in. If you saw the movie, you should read the book."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"It's a great book, and I would put this on the top of my list. When I first read it I couldn't put the book down, it's like Harry Potter. I read it when I was 9 years old. The librarian told me that it was for 6 graders. The series include Eragon, Eldest , Brisingr, and Inheritance. Now I'm already on the fourth book. In the beginning it might seem boring, but if you keep reading on, it will quickly become interesting. I was so absorbed in it that I didn't care I was too young to read it. The book is about a poor farm boy who finds a stone and tries to trade for it for food for his family. However, the butcher refuses to sell to him because he thinks the stone is useless. Then Horst buys the meat for Eragon, and tells him he is in Horst's debt. The stone turns out to be a dragon egg. Eragon's uncle, Garrow is then killed by Razacs. Eragon later finds a friend, Brom, who turned out to be dragon rider, and dies later. Eragon with another friend Murtagh breaks out of an enemy jail, , finds an elf named Arya, and a dwarf's army in the palace. They then go to war against the Urgals. King Ajihad was killed during battle. I have read several dragon books such as Dragon Riders and Dragonology. This is by far the best. Some parts of the Eragon books can be pretty sad because lots of people end up dying. Eragon had to slay Shurikan , Monsters, Razacs, and Urgals. Some parts of this book are also funny. My only complaint is that there are only four books in the series. There are lots of words in the ancient language, but in the back of the book there is a glossary and maps that help a lot. I highly recommend reading the Eragon series."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Eragon is an exciting fantasy that i can read over and over.Some of the things that make Eragon unique is that it dosent complacate details in the book, like calling a dwarf a dwarf its as simple as that its not called a small person from underground.Some parts in the book make you picture the scene more in your mind which gives a closer experince to the stroyline.Thats why i give this book 5 stars"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I read all of the books and the're the best books Iv'e ever read!

I know there was a movie made about it, and I loved the movie, but the book is different. They were able to incorporate a lot of the book into the movie, but there were several things done differently. There weren't enough differences for me to complain, but I seldom complain anyway.Anyway, Eragon is a teenager who lives on a small farm. He does indeed learn that he is a Dragon Rider and hatches the egg containing Saphira. Saphira grows quickly and becomes very hard to hide. Luckily for Eragon, Brom is in his small village and helps him to learn his new role of Dragon Rider. Of course this happens after Eragon's farm is destroyed and family killed.This entire first book is about how Eragon is training to become the savior of their world. It's enchanting and exciting. Every second is full of adventure. I couldn't put it own when I read it. I quickly bought book two after I finished this one and sat on my hands for what seemed like forever waiting for book three.

The only exceptions being Solembum and Angela-character wise- and the last two chapters. It wasn't this epic adventure...it was long and mostly boring. The chapters were too short. and parts of the story too clipped. And this did not strike me as original. It seemed like it was mixed up of Harry Potter, Lord of the rings, and Merlin(The BBC series). Not to mention the word \\"stymied' came up enough to be annoying.So, in short. Didn't love it. Won't be reading books 2-4."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Eragon is one of the many novels I have wanted to read for a long time but never got round to. At home, Mrs B and I have many bookshelves filled with unread books but very slowly I'm starting to work my way through the intimidating pile. As a writer of fantasy, I am always interested in trying new authors in this field, learning from the best and avoiding the styles of those I find disagreeable. Eragon author, Christopher Paolini, intrigued me, having first started his novel at the tender age of 15! I didn't conceive the idea of Elenchera until I was 17 let alone start writing a book, so in approachingEragon I was curious to see how young Paolini would compare to the veterans of this field.The novel, set in the world of Alagaesia, follows the journey of Eragon who discovers a mysterious blue stone while hunting close to his home in Carvahall. Initially trying to trade the stone for money, Eragon is soon left with a dragon hatchling he names Saphira. When King Galbatorix sends his legions in search of the egg, Eragon and Saphira are faced with a difficult choice - join the king's forces or seek out the Varden - a race of elves, supported by dwarves, who are in direct defiance of Galbatorix. To stand together against both sides is simply unthinkable.Being the first in the Inheritance series, Eragon has the difficult job of setting the background to the key characters that will take part in the overall picture. Paolini handles this well and although some early segments are inevitably plodding, I didn't find myself bored and once Eragon leaves Carvahall with Saphira the book really comes to life. Eragon is a hero in the mould of Tolkien's hobbits, inexperienced in combat but gradually flourishing under the guidance of his friend, Brom, and in the adversity he faces on the road. The relationship between Eragon and Saphira builds tenderly, revealing the close connection between them in their ability to speak through their minds. Being young, Saphira is impressive but vulnerable in combat and whatever dangers she and Eragon face things are never straightforward for them. Eragon himself begins learning magic but finds it is a risky business with the loss of control over some spells potentially costing the caster their life!While Eragon and Saphira are the principal characters, the book offers a great supporting cast for the duo. Brom is something of a closed book with an in-depth knowledge of ancient languages while being a fully competent warrior. He is instrumental in training Eragon to be a Dragon Rider, a group nigh on extinct in Alagaesia. A later companion, Murtagh, also has secrets but is happy to travel with Eragon and Saphira, his motives remaining open to debate until the latter stages of the book. Finally, there is an elf maiden, Arya, whom Eragon rescues and chooses to return to her people - the Varden, enemies of King Galbatorix. Paolini's characters and settings are given detailed descriptions but not to the extent that I was wishing he would just move things along. His depiction of the fearsome Shade, Durza, was one of the highlights for me while the Urgals are the vicious army in this book, the equivalent of the Uruk-hai and Orcs in The Lord of the Rings. Individual characters' histories are neatly introduced and revelations leading up to the novel's climax are well-timed.Being the first in a series of novels, Paolini was under pressure to end the novel on a decent cliff hanger, leaving you yearning for the next book. With Eragon the concluding segment sees Eragon and Saphira fighting alongside the Varden against a massive Urgal army led by the imperious Shade, Durza. It's a bloody but well described exchange beneath the mountain, Farthen Dur, and in the aftermath the next stage of Eragon's journey is laid out before him. It's a fitting end to what has been an epic journey.Christopher Paolini deserves a huge round of applause for Eragon. It follows some standard strains of fantasy novels but it's becoming harder to create something completely original in this field. Tolkien is unlikely to be overhauled as the pinnacle of fantasy excellence but in Christopher Paolini there is a young author with many years of novels ahead of him. All I have left to say is that the sequel to Eragon, Eldest, will be finding its way onto my reading pile very soon."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This is realy good book.

Remember this book is written for young teens and has well-written, short chapters. The book is long, but because of the short chapters, I found it hard to put down. I disagree with the person who wrote a review stating they are a professional editor and spouted off a litney of \\"errors\\". WHO CARES!!! Nobody (average Joe/Jane reader)thinks about those things when they are reading unless the story is so poorly written. I just think you can't argue with the New York Times Bestseller list.

YES YES it is not new. In fact I recognize all the elements that were taken from the classic works of Fantasy. Just like Eragon, Paolini is just a fledging, a teenager who is thrown into the perilous adventure of writing only to confront the evil critics into a long epic battle of good vs. evil. I admire him because he had the courage to give to the world this book at such a tender age. Also, like Eragon, he is not a master yet. There is a lot he needs to learn. He is still sloppy with his penmanship(sword) and his magic use of language. Give him time and he will prove to be a great writer and one to contend with.All in all I thought the story was quite entertaining, since I read it for the purpose of having a good time and not to rip it apart into pieces.

Eragon is a book for some what mature audiences as there is a bit of violence and a little romance, not to deep mind you but just enough suggested reading age is (maturely) 14and older although you so called adults might scoff at reading a so called \\"young adult\\" book I think you should give it a try.Set in the land of (I'm probably going to murder this) Aglastia under the rule of a tyrant king after the fall of the now legendary dragon riders the story starts in a dark wood the shade's ambush fails and the elf maiden sends the \\"strange blue rock\\" to... the next chapter !wherein we meet our hero for the rest of the book Eragon (oh not the same as the title I wonder if he is destined for great things?!) who misses the deer but picks up the \\"strange blue rock\\" sent from the previous chapter this turns out to be an egg that hatches into a baby dragon. But you knew that if you read the back of the book.( Now don't lie even I Kate The Great reads the back of the book)the baby dragon named sapharia by eragorn can talk to eragorn threw his mind eragorn goes to talk dragon lore with the local story teller Brom, whom I get the feeling knows more than he says, and the story takes off from there.If you expect to tell you more of the plot you will be disappointed as I want you to buy this book at your local independent bookstore as opposed to this website. I will assure you that in all my years of reading I have never found any thing better. This book tops my personal favorite fantasy booklist and if you enjoyed it I think you would also like sabriel, lerial, and abhorsen, (again sorry for the misspell) by Garth Nix the his dark materiasl trilogy; The golden compass, The subtle knife, and The amber spy glass by Phillip Pullman the harry potter books are also acceptable if not as good however I do tend to view the books threw a rather jaundiced eye as I have been wait in to long for miss Rowling to get her rear in gear and finish the books before the movies! Oh dear me sorry for the rant but I get a little worked up about this. Another of my favorite authors is Diana Wynne Jones and her book dark lord of derkholm is a riot!

I can't say that about most fantasy books. For some reason everyone brags about the bigger name writers like Norton, Lackey, Eddings, and Brooks.

People have to realize that every book since the Lord of the Rings has used Tolkien's idea about elves, and that is the way it is. Because no one can forget what an incredible idea that is. Now, I am 13 years old, and some of you old-timers may think that I know nothing about good writing skills and blah-blah-blah. But you don't have to be 40 to know what a great book this is and how inteligent and talented Christopher Paolini is. I have read this book 5-10 times and I think that anyone who has read it that many times will agree with me when I say that this book has totaly replaced Star Wars and The Lord of The Rings. (They are still there and are still great books AND movies) I have the Lord of the Rings movies. All three, directors cut too. I have watched them hundreds of times and I have read the books also, but I think that it is a good thing to have a more modern-languaged text.This book totaly pulled me into it. I sat on my couch, in my bed, at my desk at school, anywhere, and read this. My friends and family can tell you how absorbed I am in this book everytime I read it. And I mean EVERYTHIME. They can be talking to me and I won't even hear them. I cannot imagine my life without this book.This book took me and made me realize what an author can do: an author can take you to a whole other world. And Christopher Paolini did that. He did such a great job! I could never ever even think about this book as being too descriptive, slow, or just plain old stupid, and not to mention being written by someone who doesn't know what they are doing.As I was reading this book I was prone to skip chapters because I didn't want to face certain parts of it again because it was to real to me. The part when they are at Yazuac almost made me cry. And i have only cried onece about a book or a movie. And the part when they were captured by the Ra'zac outside of Dras'Leona makes me sick to my stomach. I can feel Eragon's pain when he is kicked by the Ra'zac, and I cry when Brom dies. This book left the most wonderful feeling inside of me. I know I will cry when I finish the third book because it will mark the end of a magical land that I have come to love through Paolini's words...By ashleigh Drew (benjamin's daughter)"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This book was really just a book report on Lord Of the Rings and other geat novels. he put it into his own words and changed the names around but alot of the story was based on LOTR.

Can you say derivative?2) Eragon also offers us with exhibit A in arguing for the principle that should be adopted by all fantasy: be wary of any fantasy series whose title is an noun. Furthermore To get math-y again, the degree to which the noun is highfalutin is inversely proportional to the quality of the writing.3) All that said, Eragon is readable and even enjoyable--in the way that Harry Potter is. As with the Potter books, you may groan every so often as you read another clunking exchange between characters, ingest a piece of ridiculous description, or discover another blantantly derivative moment. That said, young Mr. Paolini can spin a plot (though he gets so into \\"foreshadowing\\" that he gives away far, far, too much--and being derivative doesn't help him as he attempts to build suspense), and he managed to keep me reading in spite of all the above--pretty impressive, since I'm not someone who can finish books that are utterly without redeeming qualities.Paolini does show flashes of the ingenuity and imagination he will need in order to leave his derivative days behind him. His world does have its unique and intriguing touches, such as a city whose citizens worship a mountain. I have yet to read his sequel, and though customer reviews suggest it will be more of the same, I am holding out hope that Paolini will realize that he can write on his own, and produce fantasy without differentiating J.R.R. Tolkien with respect to literary value. So Eragon can be a fun read--just keep your expectations low and be prepared to groan a bit."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Yes, I've read it all. the 5-star reviewers raving about how this teenager managed to write a bestselling novel. the 1-star reviewers grumbling about how everything is copying from Lord of the Rings, McCaffrey, etc.I hate to say it, but I really disagree with both. Yes, kudos to Paolini for managing to write this at his age, but to me, it really doesn't matter how old someone was when they wrote this. I personally listened to the entire book on tape (and loved it) before realizing the age of the author.And true, Paolini's book does lack some originality, but I have never read The Wizard of Earthsea, Sabriel, and most of the other books mentioned by the one-star reviewers (although I have read the Dragonriders of Pern series and Lord of the Rings,for who hasn't?)I think that readers should just accept the book for how good the storyline is, and just forget about what he's copied.I am not saying that the 1-star reviewers are not entitled to their own opinion, for they are. It takes all sorts to make a world, after all.In my mind, I think that his writing does have complexity, especially for someone his age.Eragon is not for everyone,as nitpickers dislike it for its inconsistencies, veteran fantasy fans are annoyed by its similarities to other books,and perfectionists just plain dislike every flaw in the story.I, however, am just someone out there looking for a good book, and I enjoy it as such."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"The book Eragon has a great story line. But it is written in a very unadvanced way. The words make the plot obvious at times. The words are the kind a kid would get out of reading something like Lord of the Rings. There is also something else to mention. This is a complete take off on the original Star Wars trilogy. I am not going to mention how, but all you have to do is read the book and make the connections. I hope the next books in the trilogy are a little better thought out.

Paolini truly captured the essence of this in his first book by including maps, languages, and plenty of adventure in what's sure to be an unforgettable trilogy!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"The big draw to Eragon is that it was published by a young author in his teens. That seems cool, especially for a teen or preteen audience. However, the obvious problem with Eragon hits like a brick wall. In high school I had friends who wrote fan fiction for whatever fantasy series was currently popular. Eragon reads like that fiction. The language is stilted with layers stiff sounding words. It has long words but doesn't flow. The plot is also soooo predictable and derivative: dragons, magic, etc. All the cliches are there and the author is taking them seriously, not putting them there to build up a cliche and then knock it for comic relief (no comic relief in the book by the way). Plotwise imagine a lifeless parody of fantasy literature.Now coming from your friend's notebook during recess that is fine and if a friend wrote this and asked me for pointers I wouldn't bash them. There is a huge difference between reading a published book and reading something a friend passes to you. Different expectations will leave you disappointed unless you are a proud parent or close friend of Chris Paolini.An aside on teens writing fiction: The Distant Soil series by Colleen Doran was published in installments starting when she was in her teens. That was an intricate and well done fantasy series by a teen (although perhaps not suitable for teens).I recommend that you find another book to read. This book will waste your time. Read reviews to find a better fantasy book. If you are looking for a book to give as a gift to a teen or preteen then there are definitely better choices. Look elsewhere."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Let me start by saying I greatly enjoyed the book. As with any book, there were flaws, but that did not make the story less enjoyable to read. About half of the reviews for this book listed here in Amazon complain that the author either stole the plot from Tolkien or other writers, or made story telling and techincal plot errors. I hate to tell you this, but most books are retellings of previous plots. Even Tolkien's \\"Lord of the Rings\\" (of which I am a fan) is a retelling of German and Norse legends. What makes any book a good read, is the way the author tells the story, and the way he developes the characters.Eragon has both of those elements, good story telling and interesting characters. Are they the best out there? No. But that does not mean this book is not a good read.As for technical or writing stlye errors, considering the fact that most books in the sci-fi and fantasy genre I read today have multiple and glaring editing errors, from mispelled and misplaced words to sentence fragments, this book was a breath of fresh air. Certainly the writting could have been 'cleaner' and the author could have used fewer words in many areas, but considering the author was 15 when he started the book I feel he did an excellent job. As with most authors, he is likely to improve his writing skills as he continues to write.I do not suggest reading the story simply because the author is young, but because the story is entertaining. Of course, not everyone will like the book. No author is liked by everyone. Having said that, I feel this is a story that people who like the fantasy genre will enjoy."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I thought Eragon was awesome,because the book's about a 15 year old boy ( Eragon) finding a dragon egg.

I liked the beginning half of the story, the farm boy finding a dragon's egg trying to figure out what to do with it. But the second half, really envelops the reader into the mind of Eragon and goes very deeply into the magical world.The last couple of chapters felt a little similar to The Lord of the Ring series, with the war and the blood shed, i am guessing Paolini drew some influence from those books. Reading about how a battle raged kind of confused me a little. But is still got you inside the main character's train of thought.What I find very good is the history he puts into the characters, Murtagh & Brom, and the mystery he puts into the legends of \\"the riders\\" and Galbotorix.For a beginner in the fantasy literature, or even a modest reader like myself, I would most definitely suggest Eragon. A very good read with no disappointments."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"As a 16 year old unpublished author, I'd first like to say that we should admire Paolini for actually writing a book.

It is astonishing to realize that this, Paolini's first work, already bears the stamp of a mature writer. It makes me shiver with anticipation to consider what he will be capable of when he gets a few more decades under his belt.\\"Eragon\\" (a work that will undoubtedly be compared to Tolkien's \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" but stands firmly on its own two feet within the genre) is well conceived and well written, built on a solid edifice of the writer's depth and breadth of thought and skill; it is thoroughly engaging and enchanting. Although he hides it well, Paolini is clearly very well read, and this work is enriched for it. As a writer, he emerges from his \\"dragon's egg\\" much like Saphira does: fiercely intelligent, growing fast, beautiful to behold, and much stronger than you'd expect.I hope Paolini has a Getrude or Angela to heal him quickly from his encounter with \\"The Book That Ate Him Alive\\" so we can read the next book in the series soon.

He finds a very smooth indestructible stone that is dark blue with white veins. The stone, which actually is a dragon egg, hatches and a dragon comes out. The dragon grows fast because of lots of growth spurts. He names the dragon Saphira after a name of a dragon from long ago.Eragon lives in a small village call Palancar Valley in a farmhouse. Eragon lives with Garrow who is not his father. After Eragon's birth his mom pleads for Garrow to raise him and Garrow accepted. Two dark hooded creatures in the shape of a human wearing black cloaks, called the Razac, are in search of a dragon egg.

Saphira quickly flies both of them to the area where the egg was found and only to return to find their house blasted to pieces. After lifting a lot of wood they found Garrow, who eventually dies. Eragon decides to revenge against Razac. The story continues with exciting adventures as Eragon and his dragon travels through difficult journeys and meets many challenges in his revenge.I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys the Lord Of The Ring series.

His characters are well-developed, his imagery strong, and his wit keen but subtle enough to avoid seeming forced.At times, he gets bogged down in descriptive detail, but the book and its engaging storyline easily overcome such minor flaws, and it ends up developing into a true page-turner.And unlike much of today's mass-produced fantasy fiction, Eragon has literary merits. It it well-written, has satisfying depth and offers tantalizing hints about what is to come in the next two books. (Who is Eragon's mother? What's the deal between Eragon and Arya? Is Murtagh a good guy or not?) Fantasy lovers will also enjoy the appendices, which include a glossary, a pronunciation guide, a series of language guides, and a map that readers will find themselves referring to constantly.Paolini is a young author with promise, and \\"Eragon\\" is a must-read book that is bound to lure new fans to the genre while satisfying old ones."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"The book Eragon by Christopher Paolini is about a boy named Eragon.

Servants of the empire, which is ruled by a very evil king, come looking for him. With the help of his dragon and the village storyteller named Brom, he goes on to face many evil foes.I personally think that this is a fantastic book. I simply just love books with adventure, dragons, and all the other fantasy stuff. This book is very suspenseful and kept me reading for 3 hours at a time.

I can think of some other authors who's early works are more stilted and whose plots are just as \\"tired\\" as this one. Also, many of parts of the book are painfully reminiscent of other authors: Tolkien, McCaffery, and possibly Lackey or McKiernan.But overall, who is to say that for a first time book that it was all bad? I think that if Mr. Paolini stays with writing that he will mature in hiw writing style and have a fruitful career. There are so few ways to deal with \\"fantasy\\" plots that there is going to be repetition of ideas between authors.Overall, this book was a nice diversion. A classic? No. Very few fantasy books can be categorized as classics. Is this book going to be on my top 10 list of all time? No. But is good enough that I am looking forward to his next book so I can see how he can deal with his version of this fantasy plotline."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"It was tough to rate this book. While I did enjoy it and it was an easy read, many of the supporting elements are all too common. Elves and dwarves, dragons and mystical swords, the list goes on. But the young author does weave a good story throughout. He brings us inside the characters just enough to understand some topics, but still be mystified and wondering about motivations.Some areas of the book are too short and not well laid out to build up suspense. The race across the desert and into the valley moved at far too fast a pace, leaving me wanting better descriptions of the scenery, the suspense, the anguish, etc.The tale wraps up fair enough and ties together some loose ends, before leaving us with a suspenseful ending. I look forward to the next chapter in this series."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Over all I found this book to be highly enjoyable.It begins somewhat stale though, reading like a Robert Jordan novel with all the names altered and then seems to call up Jane Yolen's Dragon's Blood in a very cut and paste manner. Only natural in a fantasy involving dragons it proceeds to add a heavy dose of Anne McCaffery. The journey itself calls to mind any number of Tamora Pierce's books although the Alanna series most heavily. Then there are several moments invoking Ursula LeGuin and, of course Tolkien. But these are all books I love....The story really comes into its own about a quarter of the way through the book (much faster than many fantasy stories) as the characters become people beyond their stereotypical rolls and new ideas begin to establish a world separate from those of the authors mentioned above. There is a very real and appreciable sense of distance, travel, and learning. Far from shying away or glossing over the process of getting from plot point to plot point, Mr. Paolini revels in the teaching and amassing of knowledge. True Eragon is no instant classic, but it lays a sturdy foundation and the book becomes surer and more evocative as it goes on. It is not hard to like and fans of the genre should be thrilled.

Eragon is a great fantasy book and there is NO way im not getting the next book The eldest.BrittonSorensen"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Well, I got this first book through a friend who obligingly lent it to me. Being that she'd read it all already, she gave me a pretty biased review of how the book was basically a rip-off of a lot of other authors and wasn't that good.So well, I read it.My opinion? No, it wasn't fantastic. It wasn't fantastic at all, but it was a pretty good start.Like someone else down on the list of reviews who wrote about Paolini's writing being rather immaturish... I agree. I'm not sure what was it about the writing, but it seems to me to be written the way I myself would have written when I was about thirteen. The style of writing, that is. I knew all about him being fifteen when writing it, however, but I can't give him brownie points for that... it makes his immature style expected and understandable, but it's just an excuse. I have to applaud him for being able to stick to it, though. Very few people have the willpower or the sheer interest in something to be able to write a story that long and make it a trilogy.The thing that annoyed me most was the bits and pieces of other authors who constantly popped in. When Brom bumped into the guy on the bridge, cut his purse and said \\"I'd say that our friend has just discovered his loss,\\" I virtually cringed. That's almost classic Eddings there. And the bit where the elves sailed from over the sea could've been taken straight out of Tolkien's Middle-Earth. The problem with other books is that once you've read them it gets harder to make your story original.Overall, a good beginning, with enormous potential. This could be good if he keeps at it and keeps on improving."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Eragon first came to my attention when it came up on my Amazon recommendations, but after looking at the reviews, I decided I didn't want it. The next day, I happened to see it at my local library, so I decided \\"What the heck! I'll read it.\\" Now that I have read it, I think it is neither so good, nor so bad as the various reviews would have you think.Eragon does borrow heavily from both Lord of the Rings and Star Wars for plot and setting, but it is the very interaction between these two extremely different stories that gives Eragon its unique charm. Despite (or perhaps partly because of) characters with suspiciously familiar names, the characters are easy to empathize with. The storyline is (for the most part) smooth, drawing the reader in so thoroughly that you could almost believe that that world and those people exist.There *are* rough spots in the narration, however. Reduntant verbs and adverbs interrupt the flow of the story in places, and detailed descriptions are occationally put in awkward places. \\"'Sorry...' he apologized.\\" is a basic example of this.Because it does draw so heavily from LOTR and Star Wars, Eragon is fairly predictable in places. However, those who are not familiar with those works (is there such a person?) may not find it predictable at all. Also, the author's unique writing style allowed him to surprise me with several of the \\"classic\\" plot points, despite my being a fan of both of the above mentioned stories.In summary, it seems to me that it is mainly Christopher Paolini's inexperience that keeps this book from it's full potential. He will most likely improve with time and experience, and I look forward to reading (and reviewing) Eldest."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Eragon is a great book for people who like fantay and adventure.

I purchased it mainly for that purpose...\\"Hey, this guy was your age when he wrote it!\\" Of course Mom had to read it first just to make sure it was appropriate...I had to go back and read it again when my son finished with it, because he kept wanting to discuss it and I had read quite a few other books in the meantime and had to refresh my memory. It was just as good the second time around. Some books really can't hold your interest again, but this one did. I will probably have to buy 2 copies of Eldest so we don't fight over who gets to read it first. I think it is a magnificent work considering the author's age.

Out of all the books I have ever read, (I have read a lot of books in my whole life), and this one was one of the best books. Let me tell you a little about this story.In the beginning of the story, a young boy named Eragon lived with is uncle and his cousin. His mother had left him there when he born. She just left to go back to the city, and never came back for him.For a month, Eragon had to go to the Spines (mountains) to hunt for his family because they were poor. The only thing that Eragon found was a big blue stone. He only took that stone back to the city of Carvahall (the city that he lived in)because he thought that it might be worth something.That stone was actualy very valuable if you know what I mean, but you probably don't because you haven't read the book.Read Eragon and find out why that stone was so valuable."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"The main thing that I have a problem with is that the older reviewers of this book don't stop to consider that for kids this book was a fantastic story.

Give him a break he's a biginner and he'll learn. So for all you adult 'know-it-alls' cut him some slack and keep your rude thoughts to yourself. Your reviews will make people not want to by his books in the future.

I could care less how old the author is and whether or not the book is similar to Lord of the Rings (which I didn't think it was so much)it was an enjoyable read. I do think writing a fantasy without elves, dragons and other such magical creatures is near impossible. I would even bet all the people complaining it was an LOTR rip off probably stood in line for the movie dressed up like the characters and are biased becaused of the name of the main character. Eragon is like Aaragon but besides that I don't see any other major resemblances. It is a good read, the main character is developed well along with the other major characters in the book and the imaginary world is developed well enough without being so detailed as to make it boring at times. I won't give you a synopsis of the story, read any other review for that but it was a fun read. There were times when I just had to keep reading and times where is slowed down a little too much.

While I was there, I came across a paperback edition of Christopher Paolini's critically-acclaimed Eragon, which is the first installment of The Inheritance Cycle. I always heard about the praise which was given to both the book and the author, and how he wrote this book starting at the age of fifteen, and so on. I gave it a try; I picked it up and immediately read the Prologue & the first two chapters. What I got from it was mild frustration. The chapters reminded me of the introduction to Star Wars: A New Hope. I guess I forgot to tell you that not only did I hear praise, but criticism as well. Many people have lambasted this book for copying Star Wars and Lord of the Rings, and I couldn't help but be reminded of that exact criticism. I quickly put Eragon back on the shelf, and I continued on in the bookstore. Cut to February of 2010, when I find myself interested in Eragon once again, but in a different way. I wanted to see how it really fared out. Is it really bad as some critics say? Is it really good? Is it just average? I didn't purchase it, however; I borrowed a hardcover edition from the library. And this, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, this became the beginning of a dismal journey. Oh, the torture!Now, like millions of people worldwide, I am an avid reader. I can read anything from fantasy epics, political thrillers, non-fiction, Shakespeare, etc. From Don Quixote to Empire Falls to even Percy Jackson & the Olympians, I have enjoyed reading almost every book that I have ever touched. All but Eragon, and a few others. Honestly, I don't think I have ever read a book as awful as Eragon. I didn't find myself fully immersed in the story. I didn't find myself caring for the characters. I didn't find the writing extraordinary or inspirational. I didn't even find the front cover very interesting to look at (but I don't judge a book by its cover, anyway). It's almost appalling to think that this was ever published.I did like one thing about Eragon, and that was the premise. The plot about a boy befriending a dragon sounds really touching (Cornelia Funke's Dragon Rider is an example of the premise done right). Unfortunately, this exact idea had to be the victim of a simplistic, formulaic plot. If you have read Tolkien's Lord of the Rings and have seen the original Star Wars trilogy, then you will notice major similarities. This is arguably the oldest formula in fantasy fiction: average villager goes on an epic journey, villager discovers he is a \\"chosen one,\\" villager battles against all odds in order to defeat the villain. We've seen this story before. Both Tolkien & George Lucas used the exact same formula for their own works, but unlike Paolini, both of them added in some fresh material and made these stories undoubtedly their own. Here, Paolini has made no changes whatsoever to the formula. And that's one of the bigger problems with Eragon's plot. There is no originality found in the entire story. Seriously, it's so overstuffed with clich&eacute;s that if I were to count them all, I would give up halfway through due to exhaustion.The characters are clich&eacute;d as well. We have elves, dwarves, witches, the works. We haven't seen these races before, have we? Plus, every protagonist, antagonist, and supporting character is very 2-dimensional. The villains are always evil, while the heroes are always good. That's it. There is no development on their motives, their personalities, or their causes & effects on the actual story. There is absolutely nothing that makes them distinctive. Brom, Katrina, and Murtagh are bad enough, but it's the character of Eragon himself that tops them all with his strange appearance and personality. First of all, the fifteen-year old boy talks and acts like a grown adult sometimes. One minute, his dialogue in simple, and the next minute, it's almost Shakespearean. He is of average intelligence, and yet he has the ability to talk like a scholar from time to time? Where did this sort of logic come from? Secondly, he somehow learns about sword-fighting in a matter of weeks, and is able to fight in battle a few months later. I know this sort of thing is acceptable in fantasy fiction, but this is just pushing too far. I mean, he's only a kid, and yet he is educated so quickly about the rules of combat. That.....is beyond my understanding. Thirdly, since he discovers he has become a dragon rider, his personality soon changes. Or rather, it changes from strange to even stranger. As I was reading, I couldn't help but see that Eragon and others are starting to see him as a messiah. This leads to the formation of arrogance. But even that soon becomes illogical, since his change of emotion is all over the place. Luckily, I saved myself from the confusion by concluding that Eragon is not a likable character. I couldn't really care about him, and that leads to my fourth problem with this character. Throughout the book, Eragon is always the main focus. It's either about him and his dragon Saphira, his encounter with people of various races, and his commitment (or lack thereof) to defeat the antagonists. It's almost always about him, and it sometimes gets annoying. Why does it always have to feel like he's the center of attention? If there were two or three more characters (of the same age) that journeyed along with Eragon, then it would have been far more interesting, because it wouldn't always be about this one boy. We would have some real friendship and cooperation; we would have teamwork instead of solo accomplishments. It would have made some intriguing material. And finally, the fifth problem I have with Eragon is that he doesn't have any real chemistry with the other characters. It seems that his relationships with Saphira, Brom, Roran, and Arya feel very forced; the conversations aren't very compelling (Brom and Eragon's discussions are especially painfully dull). In addition, Eragon always argues with his friends, but then he is united with their own views later on. This really brings a ton of confusion to their interactions with one another. And why in the world is Eragon always with ADULTS and not kids his own age? Wouldn't that affect his social capabilities when he reaches his own adulthood? *sigh*The plot and characters are bad, but the writing itself is another matter. People are always saying that Paolini is a brilliant writer, and that he has created a work of art. Paolini himself has compared his work to Lord of the Rings and Beowulf. Have we really lost our intelligence? This book would be torn apart if it were up against Lord of the Rings. And yes, I have read both Beowulf and Lord of the Rings; these two are rightfully named as literary classics. Eragon is not, and if it is, then humanity is lost forever. Moreover, Paolini's writing style really puzzles me. There are too many uses of the word \\"was.\\" There are misplaced verbs, adverbs, and adjectives everywhere, as well as an excessive amount of them in general. The \\"show, don't tell\\" rule is broken many times. And who can forget those unnecessary similes? Well, neither can I. The writing is indeed excruciating.And now, we come to a very important element of the novel: the demographic. Is this supposed to be aimed at kids or teens? Is this suitable to grownups? Is it for people of all ages? I don't know. I can't really tell. Even though this is originally for younger audiences, I think it's a bit debatable. The violence suggests that it's for adults, but the simplistic storyline might indicate that it's for kids. It's almost to the point that it is a mystery that needs to be solved. In the end, I'd say both kids and adults deserve better.I could go on forever with what's wrong with this novel, but I can't. Why? Because I don't think I can take the pain of doing so! Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, this is it! This is the abomination that I, and many others, have sadly experienced! Eragon is simply the worst book that I have ever read in my entire life. Almost everything about it is a failure. Clich&eacute;d plot, dull characters, idiotic hero, laughable dialogue, slow pacing, deplorable writing, and a questionable tone dominate over 500 pages of boredom and pain. And I don't care if the author wrote this at a young age. He should have delayed the publication of his work in order to make some major improvements. Don't get me wrong, Paolini does have some potential. Unfortunately, it doesn't show here. Aside from all the flaws, Eragon does have one thing going (apart from the premise mentioned above). As an aspiring writer, this book has given me some splendid advice on how NOT to write a novel. You got to give Paolini some credit for making us see what's wrong and what's right. Overall, Eragon is an agonizing read from the Prologue to the glossary. It's an embarrassment in the fantasy genre, and it's pure trash. I can't wait to return it to the library.Grade: FP.S.This book is so terrible, that it makes me wonder if Eldest is even worse....."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"\\"Brisingr\\" Eragon yelled as he shot his arrow at an Urgal. As he did though, blue flame came out of his hand and shot with it. Eragon was just this 15 year old farmer boy living with his uncle. Up until now nothing in his home town, Carvahall, has been abnormal. That changed ever since he went to the Spine and found a blue, web like rock. This was no ordinary rock however. It was a dragon egg! Once it hatched, Eragon decided that is name was Saphira. Whenever Saphira walks her scales ripple like a giant blue ocean. Together Eragon, Brom the merchant, and Saphira head to the Varden to get training done because Eragon is a Rider. Brom is very mysterious and sagacious. He is wise by giving Eragon help with which decisions he should make during their adventures. Brom also keeps much of his life a secret from Eragon; Eragon can never figure out why.Now that Eragon has been traveling he really has no home to go back to. Before Eragon left, his uncle died in a fire at his house. This was caused by the Ra'zac. These creatures are not human, dwarf, or elf. These creatures have beaks, huge eyes, and only feed on human flesh. When Eragon gets to the Varden he is sent into battle against a bunch of Urgals that were sent by Galbatorix. When he goes somewhere else to help, he gets wounded on his back by a Shade, Durza. Because of Durza's attack, his wound has affected his great swordsmanship, and magic. Whenever he makes a wrong movement he ends up hurting himself and passes out. Saphira tries to help by blocking the pain with magic but it is too much. Saphira and Eragon have a good relationship as it should be with Dragon and Rider.This book really expresses the themes Exploration, and Community. Eragon discovers many different feelings about himself that he has never felt before, and has found new strength also. Brom contributes to Eragon on their journey by helping him control his magic. Eragon contributes to the Varden by giving his abilities to them. The Varden contributes to Eragon by providing provisions and hospitality. In Eragon some interesting words in the ancient language are brisingr, which means fire, Shur'tugal, which means Dragon Rider, garjzla, which means light, and gedwey ignasia, which means shining palm.Will Eragon make it to Ellesmera to complete his training? How does he cope with his scar from Durza? Will he survive in the battle of Farthen Dur? Is he the last of all the Riders?

Sure it's not that remarkable. It's been written before, etc, etc. But this is something to unwind with, simple and not harrowing, just plain feel-good. Predictable, yes. Underdeveloped writing, yes.

The story is an amazing one for me, a lover of fantasy books. If the author's name was Tolkien (my favorite) or even R.A.

I'm one that hates to cary around huge books to read, so I let it sit in my room for at least a month before I even picked it up, based on size alone. And then I read the first chapter, had no idea what an \\"urgal\\" was, and set it down for another week and a half.Being a huge fantasy-lord of the rings-harry potter fan, I figured a book about a boy and his dragon would be something along the lines of Anne McCaffrey's Dragonriders of Pern books. How wrong I was.After starting the first chapter and seeing Eragon find this blue jewel and the blue jewel being an egg, I was entranced. Finishing the book in three days, it was clear to see that with all the internal conflicts, I wasn't going to get my fix of Arya the elf in 528 pages.The one set back to the book was how Paolini would put the ancient language spells, and no translation next to it.

Okay, okay, we know it is the the most descriptive book on the shelves but after reading Eion colfer books, J.K. Rowling, Corniela Funke, Philip Pullman (writer of his dark materials series) Diane Duane and Tolkien (Lord of the Rings) you have to say Eragon is a mix of all of them. This is the fun of reading a book all over again that doesn't have way too many words that confuse the younger readers (unlike Lord of the Rings) and has a nice twist of magic, (Harry Potter, Philip Pullman, Diane Duane) a hint of Love to come, (Philip Pullman, Harry Potter) action, ( Lord of the Rings) adventure, (Lord of the Rings, Philip Pullman,Corniela Funke, Diane Duane, Eion Colfer) and pure wit (Eion Colfer) all bundled up in a nice thick book. It is not really short. (200 pages or less)but not in EXTREMELY long (1000+) and when you look at it and see this cool dragon face on the cover looking back at you, you know it is fantasy, you know you will be able to read this book and feel the magic pulsing through your veins once more as you are sucked into it's pages. No feeling is trully better."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Eragon is, without question, a good book-in fact, when I was reading it for the first time I could hardly put it down. However, when you read it for the second and third times, you start to see the similarities between it and so many other fantasy epics...most prominent, Star Wars and The Lord of the Rings. Star Wars, particularly-a boy's family is killed, he goes with an old man who has a mysterious past away from his homeland, rescues a beautiful woman who has, in her last seconds of freedom, transported something that is of vital importance to the survival of a rebellion-the examples go on and on.In contrast, though, I thought that Saphira, Angela, and Orik were all particularly good characters. They all had fully developed personalities, good senses of humor, and they seemed to be truly figments of the authors imagination-or based on people in real life instead of in other books. I also really liked the description of Tronjheim. The book is engrossing and good fantasy, although you can tell that it is a begining work. I think that the trilogy will get better with time, and I do recommend the book."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Aside form the generic criticism of hardcore fantasy fans, this book has recieved much praise across the literary world, and with good reason. It is straigthforward, easy to read, and entertaining. Who could ask for more?Essentially, Paolini takes other elements of fantasy (i.e. dragons, magic, princesses, evil kings, etc.) and piles it all into one sleek book. The pace is enough to keep you reading, but it never gets too fast, and Paolini does an excellent job of exploiting the core plot elements.The characters themselves are well developed, and highly intriguing. Saphira, the dragon, makes the story. With her keen wit and brash attitude, she becomes perhaps the most well rounded personality. Eragon is very brave, but often thinks before acting. All other characters are less significant, but they are well developed and worth the words taken to portray them.Overall, the book is a must read for almost anyone truly intrigued by fantasy or even just partially intrigued by it. Eragon is a perfect example of what literature is all about. Experiencing an adventure that you can't experience in the real world: a perfect application of the imagination."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Wow!!! This was an excellent book, and all you people saying it has been influenced by Tolkein, yes, it has, but in a good way! From the first paragraph, \\"Wind howled through the stormy night, carry a scent that would change the world. A tall Shade lifted his head and sniffed the air. He looked human except for his crimson hair and maroon eyes\\", I was hooked, and I couldn't put it down until I had finished the book. I loved the description and the excitement. I mourned and rejoiced with the characters and was caught up completely in the story until the last sentence, which left me begging for more. Gosh! Can you believe that this guy is only eighteen? Can't wait until the next one! Good job to Christopher Paolini!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I think Eragon is the best book for you if you like fantasy/action/fiction. It shows and teaches how to be loyal and you can picture the scenes perfectly.This is why I rate this book a five. This book is also educationel."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I think this is a good book. It is wonderful for the age group it is directed at. It does have a lot of detail, a little crying, and a juvenile plot; but honestly, there are only so many basic fantasy plots to choose from, and if you haven't yet lost your innocence, this one's plenty action packed.I liked the amount of detail because it helped me visualize all the goings on in the book. I know many people who enjoy long novels for this reason. If you don't like the style or plot, you'll know within the first 30-40 pages, so just put it down and stop ruining the book for others. However, if you are interested by then, I think you'll love it.It's beautiful for fantasy lovers caught in the gray area between children's stories and fantasy novels directed to adults. It contains many plot elements similar to those in adult novels without all the extraneous plotlines containing themes you never wanted to learn about. Honestly, if you can't get into (or stomach) an R-rated movie, you should be reading this, not Robert Jordan, Terry Goodkind, or George R.R. Martin.Also, from an objective standpoint, this is a great book to help you acquaint yourself with more vocabulary and longer novels. If you're 11-16, this is a good book for you. If you're 30 and a seasoned fantasy reader, I wouldn't reccomend it so much."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Doesn't Paolini know how to be nice? The fast action and originality of ERAGON kept me hanging until the very last period. It was not very nice of Paolini to end the first book where he did. He could have at least have waited until he finished the sequel to release the first one. I am dying to read the second book. Hurry up and finish ELDER, Paolini!!!This book realy just \\"puts\\" you there so well. When Eragon and Sophia were flying over the desert, I was flying over the desert. I could feel the humidity and heat. I could see the lush vegetation of The Spine so vividly it scared me. This book fed my minds eye directly.I stayed up many a night reading under the covers with a flashlight, lost in this enrapturing tale until the flashlight's batteries ran out.

And the elves ride on the same silver ships and look(exactly) the same as in LOTR. I could go on, but I won't. My point is that this is a good book, but thats onley becuse it stole so much from LOTR.

I am big on the belief that character's make the story. Eragon, Saphira, Brom, and even that herb witch Angela with her werecat were fun and intriguing.Plot-wise, I will admit, it was a bit cliched -- I mean, come on, farm boy's life is turned upside down when baddies come and wreck his home; he sets off on a fantastical journey with some old dude (his guide!); he meets a mysterious (and beautiful) lover-to-be. Yes, that is a bit ... overdone, but like I said, characters make the story and because Paolini did a good job making his characters interesting, I had no problem overlooking the myriad of cliches. Now-a-days it is quite hard to think up an original idea without relying on past works for inspiration so do give this young writer a break for seemingly stealing ideas or whatever -- it's been done plenty of times and there are things called archetypes!All-in-all, I enjoyed Eragon and am looking forward to the next book."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Christopher Paolini applies the classic fantasy formula with varying results in Eragon.The beginning is very slow, somewhat simplistic, and ended up detracting from what would otherwise have been a four star book.

There is not much origional material here, yet the kids still found it fun.As a parent and experienced fantasy reader, I did not find it objectionable, just unorigional.

The main character of the story is a farm boy named Eragon who finds a mysterious blue stone in the forest. Eragon's life changes forever when the egg hatches and he becomes a \\"Dragon Rider\\".

I am totally immersed in the story and the world Paoloni has created, and looking forward to the time I can pick it up again. I recognize a lot of themes and parallels with other fantasy stories of course, but still I think Paolini gives them his own twists to keep you interested.

But that's the point!I first read this book when I was looking for appropriate high-interest fiction for my 4th grade son. Although he wasn't interested in the book at the time (he is reading it now, in 6th grade), I loaned my copy of it to his classroom teacher for their library. His classmates loved it, as do I.

Can he and his young dragon over come the empire, or are they destine to fail.This is the first book in the series, and following it is Eldest. I think this book was really good. I liked all the adventure and danger that they added. One of the downsides to this book was that it was really long, and had a lot of details that didn't make sense. My Favorite chapter is called the \\"The Death Watch,\\" because it really changed the book around. The best part was the very last battle with Durza and Eragon. This Battle was really good and had a lot of details. It had a plot full of twists that kept me on the edge of seat.I would recommend this book to both boys and girls.

Going into the story, I knew how young its author was, adding to the difficulty for gathering maturity from the plot. It has excellent vocabulary, some words I've only heard in the most developed novels, but the dialogue itself between characters lacked a sense of... personality. It felt very young to me when the characters would speak to each other, like Eragon, Saphira, and even creatures like the Ra'zac.

Eragon pulls you into the story and reads like your involved, just like all great books. I'm glad of the praises it has received, they are well deserved. Eragon and its' sequel have made a great impression on my reading.The fact that it being written BY a teenager have some people saying that it's 'immature.' That is of the opinion, as are all reviews. Even if it was immature, which it wasn't, doesn't mean that the plot was over used or the book isn't any good.Eragon was the only book I had to pull me away from my reality and it succeed wonderfully. I'm was surprised by the \`bad reviews' some people gave on Eragon. Of course it's your opinion. Just by you so called \`review' saying that a teenager has no idea of what it takes to make a \`good' book and have it published, will drive many away from ever having their book even looked at. I have seen plenty of books and novels written by teenagers that are wonderful. If LOTR is all you can base your so called \`mature' out look on every book then be a little more opened minded.Eragon is a great book , from a great author. If you enjoy reading adventure AND fancy and have an open mind, you will enjoy reading this. That's my opinion not a review."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I thought eragon was one of the best books i have ever read the best part had to be the end. I am deffintly reading Eldest and the rest of the series"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"After reading all of the mixed reviews regarding this book, I decided I had to read it. Let me tell you, I thought it was awesome. Yes, there are similarities to other books and one particular movie series, but it was enjoyable nonetheless. It is very evident that the book was written by a teenager, but I think that's one things I liked about it. I thought the writing was pretty straight forward and to the point, as well as easy to read. Good job Paolini, keep it up. I am currently reading the second book and enjoying it very much. As an avid fantasy reader I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading, whether it be fantasy or not. To those of you who stress out about the small things, such as the similarities to other authors and obvious clues Eragon should be picking up on, I recommend you get out of your mom's basement and put the dungeons and dragons board away (or whatever it is you use to play the game)! There is more to life than fantasy, it is after all just fiction. Memo: elves, dwarves, dragons, etc. don't really exist, it's just make believe!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Sure, Eragon is a real page-turner. However, you can't but help notice some cliche that's been put in the story. Eragon and Saphira acted childish and foolish sometimes without us (the reader) being told or shown so. Also, Paolini could have improved his method of characterization throughout the story. He could have made Jeod into a more round character because he would become important later, but we really didn't get to know him, only that he is part of the Varden. This is not overanalyzing the story but rather just looking at where Paolini could have improved. You can't help but see this. I am surprised that Knopf published the book without catching these errors, even more so because the book was to be marketed to teens and older children. On the other hand, Eragon is a great book, especially since it was written by a 15-year old, not 17. The marketing of the book did not make it popular; many books have been advertised a lot and still turn out to be flops. What made this book popular was that it was a book that could not be put down. Nobody buys the second book (Eldest) unless he or she liked the first, so nobody can say the book is popular because of marketing. People like it because it's a good thriller/ imagination stimulator. It's just not a book that you can stop. Eragon could have been better, but that doesn't make me think that it's the worst book in the world like some other reviewers have pointed out.The major conflict that plays into the climax isn't introduced until about halfway through the book. By then your thinking that the conflict and the climax will be dealing with the Ra'zac, but no. I'm not telling who, but a new character is introduced halfway in the story and the entire story takes a left turn from there. If you've already read both Eragon and Eldest, then you know that the Ra'zac conflict will continue in Eldest, but no clues in Eragon give that away.One more point I'd like to make is in retaliation to another review written recently. What teenager wouldn't want to be published if given the chance? He or she would have a voice in the world, something few teenagers and young adults have. Being successful may be a matter of opinion, but I just don't buy the fact that not all teenagers want to be published. Getting published is the same thing as saying that your writing stands out above most other writings in the nation. You are now a nationally known celebrity. What teenager wouldn't want that?One more thing is that you have all these reviewers giving Eragon 5 stars when all they say is that its a really great book. Can anyone explain WHY it's a really great book? (Not just that it's a page-turner)The movie Eragon is set to release in July 2006.

I saw the movie first (I don't recommend that one) and wanted to know what the story was really like. I bought this one and consumed it in five days. My imagination was going wild as I read this, fueled by Paolini's vivid descriptions.About a year ago, I read Dracula, and since then I haven't read a book that had me as gripped as this one did. I definitely recommend this one to all."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I am a long time fantasy/sci-fi fan. Like many others, when I saw Eragon and peeked inside, I felt it was a bit derivative, revisiting situations we've seen before in other classic adventures and epics.But...that's OK! It is a lot of fun, big adventure, smoothly delivered.Our hero Eragon is familiar but engaging, the farmboy with great destiny, thrust into adventure under the tutelage of a mentor from the old days, before the Empire. Eragon befriends the wily and mysterious Murtagh on his way, the rough and tumble, out for himself young warrior who makes a connection with our hero. Finally Eragon encounters other freedom fighters and falls in as inspiring hero, facing his toughest challenge at the book's climax.We are introduced to Saphira, the dragon and companion to Eragon, source of his power and matching his courage, and tied to his destiny.Heroes, villains, vast landscapes, magic, swords, and wonder. It is familiar but still works well, I enjoyed it and I am now onto the sequel, Eldest, where I expect Paolini's growth as a writer will thicken the story and continue to introduce a few new ideas to the tropes we've experienced before.The travelogue in the middle of the book slows the pace, but the reward of the discoveries and battles at the end of the book make it all worth while."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"i read this book right before the movie came out, and loved it. I look forward to reading Eldest, soon."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I probably would have finished this book except that it was inconvinient to do so. But from what I read, eragon doesn't really do anything wrong, but it didn't do anything new either. I can't really find anything to object to except that the book lacked life. It didn't have that spark of originality that I really want in books. If you want a good fantasy that isn't going to shock you, this is probably your best bet, but otherwise, I doubt this book would have done well if it didn't have the gimmick that it was written by a kid."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Strength, magic, power...how would you use it? Eragon is just an average farm boy before stumbling upon a \\"stone\\" that will forever change his life. Eragon keeps this \\"stone\\" while hunting, only to later find out it is a dragon egg. Bestowed upon him is a life of a rider, sworn to protect from evil, and take down the fowl powers of the evil king Galbatorix. Eragon has to rely on magic, strength, willpower, and most of all love and friendship to try to take down such an incredulous force of evil.The book Eragon, written by Christopher Paolini, is a fantasy novel based on sole moral. In the book, Eragon is accompanied by the storyteller of the town, Brom, and his dragon, Saphira, in which they all travel together, turning their relationship into something miraculous. The book Eragon is told through a narrator's perspective, and takes place in the world of Alegaesia. This book is full of detail, which is something that will have you reading and reading to how the author sucks you in through his unbelievable vocabulary.This book is far from controversial, and I would rate it a 5 star. This book is for everyone in my opinion, regardless if you do not enjoy fantasy. I say this because of his remarkable descriptiveness, and his sentences that inspirationally flow. If you enjoyed this book, than I would definitely recommend Christopher Paolini's other book, Eldest. All in all this is a stupendous book, and you would be throwing away a good read if you let this book pass by."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Eragon is an awesome book that has stupendous detail and nail-biting suspense. When Eragon, Saphira, Arya, Ajihad, and Orik were fighting against the Urgals in Farthen Dur this book made me feel like I was one of the many drawves, elves, and humans fighting alongside them.The detail in this book is unbeliveable! When Christopher Paolini describes the loss of Eragon's father, Garrow, the detail made it seem like you were watching this really happen in front of your face instead of reading it in a book. The identies in this book are really cool too. Their so hidden! I never suspected Brom of being one of the mythological Dragon Riders, or Murtagh of being Morzan's son. When the author reveals whos who you're like whoa! I didn't see that one coming. I think what really made this mavelous book simply irresistable is the connection between Eragon and Saphira and of reality and myths. I think this duo is the perfect represenitve of that. Eragon is just a poor farm-boy and Saphira is a powerful magical dragon. Some one could go and find an rock that is really valuble, but instead of being a boring story that anyone could go do, Christopher turns it around and thrusts you're mind in to an endless rollercoaster of what could happen to an ordinary farm-boy and a mythological beast when their worlds are joined. I can truly say from the heart that this has got to be the BEST book I have ever read!!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"EragonThe book I am reviewing is called Eragon by Christopher Paolini. I would say it is a great book because of all the action and greatly descriptive paragraphs. I think it's for fifth grade and up because of all the small words and such big pages and I think it would be very hard for a 2nd grader to read. I mean it's a little hard for me to read, too! It takes place on a farm where a boy finds a dragon egg. It hatches and it grows very big and they travel to the land of darkness to defeat the evil dragon king. I would give it five stars.

This is a wonderful story, and even though it follows the traditional epic characteristics, it still feels fresh and unique. It's definately worth a read.

I learned later that it was written by a young man who started the book when he was just 15.After settling in to read the first chapters of this book, I thought to myself, I'm not sure if I can manage to finish this.The writing was very bland, with little interesting imagery and uninspired sentence structure.However, I gave it a chance and kept on reading. After Eragon leaves his home things got much more interesting and it seems that Christopher Paolini's writing style grew tremendously within a short period of time.Sure the ideas have been done before, but truly, is there any fantasy left that hasn't been borrowed upon from previous authors? Give the kid a break.Christopher obviously had a passion for his story as he wrote it and the emotion came through. He has some beautifully written passages using some uncommon and refreshing vocabulary. This story is meant to be a series so of course I had to let go the more annoying charactistics of Eragon and Murtagh, etc as I know that Christopher will allow these characters to grow and change in the next books. I look forward to their journey.I would recommend this book to anyone who loves fantasy and certainly to the young adults the book was written for."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This is one of the greatest books of all time.

I want the second book is written just like the first one is.It is a wonderfully imaginative story of a heros journey.

I admire that the author is so young and such a good writer, but I don't think that this book is all that it's made up to be. I was really let down after reading it. However, I would read the next book to see what happens."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"After I finished this book, I tried to convince my mother into reading this book. My mom is an incredible book worm, who will just read anything quickly. She read the entire left behind series, which is twelve books, in just a few weeks. Even though my mom is a book worm, the book of Eragon has not really reached out and grabbed her. But she does not really like fantasy that much, so for those of you who may not like this book, it is probably because you are not crazy, and I mean crazy, fantasy fanatics. I never knew I was that interested in fantasy until I read this book, I tried to read LOTR (Lord of the Rings) and it just did not suck me into the book. I find this great book called Eragon probably the best book I will ever read, until I read the sequel Eldest. But so many people hate it on Amazon, I and think that for this book you have to find a taste that is just right for the book. And if you do not have that certain taste, just a taste bud off, you may not like the book at all. I am happy that I have the taste buds made for this book because it is so enjoyable. If you find the begining boring or not that reaching, I had the same probem, but once the terrible things start happening to Eragon you will possibly fall into it. Believe it or not the begining chapters of this book were even worse than they are now, and the begining chapters for me are okay. So be happy those opening chapters are not worse than the okay version now.I find that to many people argue about how old Paolini was when this book was written, and even though it is a greatly written book for his age and it was a great career starting, I have two words: WHO CARES! I mean, yeah, that is impressive for his age but we do not need to kill each other over the fact of how old the person was when he wrote it, as long as he is around that age of 17, or 15 or whatever.So in the end this book is a perfect book, but you may not have the \\"taste buds\\" for the book. 5/5 or 10/10, or 100/100"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"after reading harry potter, the lord of the rings, and watching star wars, im still finding it hard to believe that eragon can enter into the fame of all this. this book is an absolute must read if you are interested with any of the above.

I couldn't put it down. All i could think about was what happens next. I also disagree with many of the other raters of this book. I did not find it easy to determine that it was written by a teenager. If no one had told me I never would have guessed. The book was very well written. The fact that it was written by a 17 year old only makes it even more impressive. If you havn't read it and the sequel then I highly recommend that you do."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I was pleasantly surprised by this book, not because the author is so young, that is incredible though, but because of the 'cheesy' title. I almost rolled my eyes straight back into my skull when seeing this title. I couldn't believe it, 'Eragon'?How could anyone title their book this, let alone name even one character this? This is Tolkien's territory, the mostly undisputed 'Father of Fantasy'. Aragon is an incredible character from a timeless literary masterpiece. I was indeed shocked. How could anyone simply change one letter in this name, write in the very same genre, using a story that is supposed to be uniquely different from LOTR, and expect me to give it a chance?But I did pick it up. The book was highly reviewed in the Boston Globe, and there I read the incredible story about this young author becoming published, and ending up on the best seller list. So I picked up this book at the book store, still horrified by the title. And I read. It didn't happen as quickly as Harry Potter, but I must say that the book almostly instantly swept me away, far away to a place where I forgot about the stupid similar name, or title choice for a book.I read the book in just under a week. I enjoyed it thoroughly. I did wonder, almost irratably at times, how I could be reading a book that was written by essentially a fifteen year old. But the book was so good that I was relieved by this dumbfoundedness.This book is a great read for children, families, and for most fantasy adult fans....not devout fantasy fans, but open minded fantasy fans that simply like a good imaginative fantasy story. If you are looking for another Dune, or LOTR, it is not here. This book is in the Harry Potter realm...but perhaps a notch lower in terms of characters, intricate plot weaving, or essentially great writing.Most of the harsh criticisms about this book are true.BUT...and I must emphasize 'but' here....the story supercedes the lesser writing elements of this book. Sure the author uses cliched descriptions, all too familiar fantasy themes, and big words straight from the dictionary and clearly out of rythym----but I must say again that the story is .....well it's great. It's filled with a great wonderful heart.I'm not interested in dragons, never have, but the author's world, and story is so compelling that I became quickly interested.The book is fun, magical, and very interesting. I gave it four stars because I did not particularly care for the ending. It seemed flat, mostly predictable, and unfullfilling. This is where the author showed his age. It felt more, in the last 80 pages or so, like a video game rather then a novel. But the book is still very good nonetheless. It's no 5 star fantasy classic, but I must admit that it is pretty close....closer then a lot of these haters care to admit....Yes 4 Stars....maybe even a quarter as well. Your kids will love this book, and you might very well like it as well. I did."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I believe that Eragon is the best book I ever read. Harry Potter used to be my favorite until this book came out. This is a book about a boy who finds a dragon and befriends it to become the first rider in a century to oppose the tyrant, Galbatorix. He finds two more companions named Arya and Murtaugh. Together, they join the Varden who continuously oppresses the king. There is a war between the Varden and Urgals where Eragon destroys a shade named Durza, and gets a cursed wound on his back. This is a skillfully woven tale about loyalty, courage, friendship, hope, and oppression. I recommend this book for all ages."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"When I started this book, I had just picked it up because of seeing so much about its sequel, Eldest.

I got through the beginning chapters and thought to myself \\"huh, the main character is 15... the writing almost seems as though it was *written* by a 15 year old,\\"... and, lo and behold, not 20 minutes later I read the inside back cover, and discovered that I was right.Paolini is a storyteller, and a good one. I can't call myself an \\"experienced\\" fantasy reader, but I've put my time in with Lewis, Tolkein, Rowling, et al., and Paolini brought some novel ideas to the table, and made a compelling story out of them. But the writing leaves something to be desired. The characters are a little flat, the emotions are a little forced, the writing just doesn't have \\"it\\", so to speak. He paints some neat pictures, but it just didn't feel like they had much life in them.All in all, I plan to continue on with the series, see where he takes it, and I hope that as he gets older his writing improves. I think Paolini has the potential to do some very compelling story telling, but he may do well to pair up and write a collaborative novel with someone who can take his imagination and give it the vehicle it needs to really shine."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"The person who likened this book to a Las Vegas style walkthrough of famous fantasy books was 100% right. Except they said it was less tacky, I think it was exceedingly tacky. Unoriginal characters, over-used/stolen plot, dull world, et cetera et cetera. As someone who reads avidly, not just fantasy books but books of every genre, I was insulted at how much hype is surrounding Chrisropher Paolini's books. I read them because my little brother was just wild about them and was insisting that if I would just read them, I would love them. After finishing them, I wondered who I could talk to about getting the wasted hours of my life back.The kid started to write it when he was 15? Kudos on having enough connections and a grammatically impaired editor. If you wanna buy this book, go for it. But expect to be disappointed if you've ever read anything more intelligent than the Garfield strips in the Sunday paper. Wait, I take that back. Sorry, Garfield. I know you stopped being funny YEARS ago but I shouldn't put you on the same level as this garbage.P.S. Those who have seen the movie: Did anyone else get the feeling that all the costumes were designed by a Las Vegas flapper? SO. SPARKLY.

I heard some really great reviews about it...and then I read it. Quite honestly, it sucked. First of all, there was the obvious Tolkein influence, fine because Tolkein was a genius, but Eragon makes for a poor imitation. It's like Middle Earth- same species [humans, elves, dwarves, etc.], similar characters [the elf woman who acts very similar to Arwen...I can't even be bothered to remember her name]. One of my biggest problems with the book was the lack of 3-dimensional characters. They were all sterotypical, did predictable things, and were completely uninteresting. I didn't care about them. Eragon could have been disembowled, drawn, and quartered, and I wouldn't have cared. Actually, I probably would've cheered. That's pretty sad, considering that he's the main character and all. So what if he's only 17? I know plenty of writers around his age that can write a hell of a lot better than he can. Yes, the plot started off as promising- the Dragon Riders were cool, but after the first chapter, it all went down hill. In sum, I WOULD NOT recommend that you read this book at all, as it is a complete waste of your time and energy. I wanted to rate it with no stars, but the form wouldn't let me."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Wish I'd read the first review on Amazon before buying this overhyped book. I can't say it any better then he- it is an impressive effort for a teenage author, but a poor imitation of Tolkien and McCaffrey's stories. The characters are wooden, and what really gives it away is the total lack of humor and the author taking himself and his story too seriously. Read the Bartimaeus books for a refreshing contrast. It did get me thinking about what qualities separate a good book from a bad one, though... When the author has to TELL you how the characters are feeling rather than letting their actions and dialogue speak for itself, that's one sign of a poorly written tome."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Okay, while I do think that Eragon has a few okay characters (Angela, the Werecat) the rest are just pathetic.

There are nearly no original elements. The characters have no personality to speak of, except for the dragon, who is smug. The action is patently unbelievable from paragraph to paragraph--I remember one scene where Eragon draws his bow and fires an arrow behind him to kill an opponent who's chasing him, and I finally quit reading when he was able to beat one of the best swordsmen in the world, left-handed, after only a few months of practice since growing up as a farm boy."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Overuse, and improper use, of language - no starsBoring, one dimensional characters - no starsBoring one dimensional and repetitive plot devices - no starsAbsence of originality, but the weyrcat pretty cool anyway - one starBrom/Eragon relationship okay - one starEragon/Arya relationship (with yucky adolescent wet dreams) - MINUS one star.Getting me to read The Eye of the Wheel - 3 starsHaving my husband leave me annoying voice mail in a deep raspy voice saying \\"I love you little one\\" - 5 starsAnd that adds up to one star.

At the beginning, there was a lot of awkward writing, but as it progressed it became smooth and well-written. Sometimes there are moments that can be truly called beautiful, like when Paolini describes a rock formation as \\"the bones of the earth\\". And he is only 19--15 when he started the book! I think he tremendously talented. It's also inspiring to me as a young writer, and encourages me to keep on trying with my own fantasy novel.A lot of reviewers have said that ERAGON is cliched and predictable. Yes, it's not terribly difficult at times to guess what's coming next. And many of the ideas have been previously used. But I think we should remember that just about every story has been told at least once. Shakespeare, in fact, cribbed the plot of ROMEO AND JULIET from another writer. But it's Shakespeare's work we remember, because of the quality of his writing. And I think it's the same with Paolini. I can't wait for the next book in his trilogy."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I've heard the constant complaints that Eragon falls into the category that every other \\"wannabe\\" fantasy novel falls under. Although I will not argue with the fact that the book is primarily about a dragon and utilizes the ever-so-popular 2-page map at the beginning, I find that these fantasy clich&eacute;s do not detract from the writing or the storyline.I generally characterize the quality of a story by its ability to hook a reader and draw him/her into the story. I read this books from start to finish in two days, neglecting many other more important matters as I often do while reading a good book. To state the fact quite frankly, if you enjoy a good old fantasy novel and don't mind a few previously used fantasy elements, this book will leave you feeling quite satisfied."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"i thought this book was okay, because it sounded a lot like Lord of the Rings, with elves, dwarves, and names, such as Eragon to Aragorn.

But with so many fantasy books, it is difficult, if not impossible, to write something completely original. Paolini's work is obviously inspired by the Lord of the Rings, but instead of copying Tolkien's format, he wanders off into his own land, with its own history and own uniqueness. For that, I applaud him.While reading this book, I was immersed into Paolini's, characters, story and world. I began feeling the emotions that the protagonist was experiencing in the story. Is that not the job of a writer? On this level, I believe Paolini was quite successful.However, when I read Eragon as a writer reads, I see some problems with his composition. The most glaring issue is his dialogue. The dialogue itself doesn't have the punch that I would have hoped and it seems as though he tried to come up with as many ways possible to say \\"Eragon said.\\" The true power of the dialogue should be what is said, not how it is said.Finally, I have an issue with some of the other \\"reviews\\" of Eragon. The trouble with previous reviews is that adults are putting adult perspectives on a book that is intended for students and kids. Overall, I would recommend this book. It is entertaining and it kept me reading. Kids looking for something to fill the LOTR void will enjoy this book; they will look forward to its sequels. As a teacher, I know that kids will appreciate this book and accept it for what it is: a good young adult fantasy book."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"this book is absolutly amazing. im not to much of a fantasy fan, but this book has fantasy, mystery, adventure, amazing characters, amazing plot, amazing places. this is a great book!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I loved this book because I like fantasy and the charcters were great.

Yes it is true that I am only 11, but all the same I have read a lot of books,none as good as this one. I suppose that the reason for me liking it is in the quality of the book, and...well, the fact that it has dragons in it. I have read many dragon books, and think that they are facinating in a cool sort of way. I like how \\"Eragon\\" describes flying. It made me feel like I was up in the air as well. I have always wanted to be able to just take off with wings...

Everything written by anybody is a rip-off of something else. All writers are the synthesis of everything they've ever read in their lives and those things affect their imaginations. The only question a reader needs to ask is \\"Is it good?\\" Eragon is very good indeed.Robert A. Heinlein wrote that there are no original ideas in fiction, just writers who are better than others at \\"filing off the serial numbers.\\"It always irks me when someone uses the phrase \\"ripped off Tolkien\\". I hate to break the news, but Tolkien didn't invent the fantasy genre. He didn't invent dragons, hobbits, Gandalf, The One Ring, and odd strangers coming into the village to take the brave heroes off to grand battles against evil. Those stories have been around for thousands of years, and he used them just as everyone else has. This is a good thing. It continues to improve the stories in use. Tolkien's greatness as an author is not in question, but don't suggest that he owns the seed of creativity, or slam what the young Paolini has boldy accomplished.George Lucas has often cited The Lord of the Rings as a major influence on Star Wars. Throw in some Flash Gordon, Akira Kurosawa's The Hidden Fortress and Yojimbo, add a sprinkling of Joseph Campbell's The Hero With a Thousand Faces, shake and bake, and you have Star Wars.Tolkien based much of LOTR on Beowulf, Norse mythology, and Richard Wagner's, Der Ring des Nibelungen, also called The Ring Cycle. Most of the similarities between Wagner and Tolkien exist because they generally drew on the same sources from Norse mythology: The Poetic Edda,The Prose Edda, The Volsunga Saga, Das Nibelungenlied, and Thidreks Saga.Christopher Paolini is in good company.

Before you start thinking that I didn't like the book-remember that I really did enjoy it. However, as a huge fan of the Harry Potter series and a fan of The Lord of the Rings, I could not help but notice numerous parallels. The characters for starters: Eragon-name that sounds like Aragon (the hero in The Lord of the Rings) and has a very similar destiny as Aragon's. Also, Eragon closely resembles Harry Potter-two confused teens who are of low self-esteem and are having trouble accepting their destinies as two of the most powerful people in their worlds. On the other hand, the Shade is akin to Saruman (LOTR), Golbitrox to Sauron (LOTR) and to Voldemort (HP), the urgals and the kull to the orcs, etc. Furthermore, the theme of Eragon and LOTR is incredibly similar in that a fellowship go and try to rid their world's of evil and establish justice, peace, and prosperity.If you are able to get over these parallels among countless others, then read-I certainately got over them and was enveloped into this kid's epic tale."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"For a 15 year old writer, I am impressed by his writing abilities, but not so impressed with the story he chose to write about.

However, if you're looking for a good fantasy book, this is recomended."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This book is really good! Readers will find themselves entwined in Eragon's wonderful tale. And I have to give the the author 5 stars for typos... I didn't see a single one in his book. Unfourtanely that seems to be the only thing his editor can do. Some of the transitions are very rough. And his adjectives seem to be clumpy instead of subtley slipped in. The storyline however was pretty good, although it could be improved. But throughout the book it never really occurs to the reader whether Eragon will survive. Of course he will. And also the writer did not throw big problems at Eragon. Eragon has minor problems of which he never can really solve on his own and therefore gets out of them without exercising his own power. The end dramatic scene is a little hasty and could be much better. Overall the book is good/ok but when you finish it will seem like you have known some of the characters before. And that is because you have. Anyone who has read Lord of the Rings will see the obvious connections within the book Eragon, (they are not even subtle). Here are some of the mysterious simularities between the two.Eragon-Hmm... doesn't it sound mysteriously like Aragorn. And guess what? Eragon is in love with an elf like ... Arwen except her name is Arya.Urgals/Kulls-Urgals, Orcs what is the difference. both are short thicklegged evil black creatures. Kulls, Uruk-Hai wow! Both are taller stronger versions than the Urgals, Orcs.Dwarves- Short, wear chain mail, miners, long beards, axes,retreated into caves after the evil king took over need I go on?Elves- Fair, tall, wonderful with bows and swords, came on ships to the Empire, joined humans against the evil people for one last glorious defeat before retreating, ride horses, wise, strong... I think you get the point.The Dark Gate- The black gate of Mordor... really.The Thirteen Forsworn- Whoa! These guys are almost exactly like the nine riders. Joined the evil guy for power, were terrorifying, used to be good Riders ...and wait a sec didn't the nine riders used to be good kings. Just too weird!There is more too.

Right out of the gate, you can see where Mr Paolini's influences lie. All the standard elements are in place and ready for action. People with strange names, creatures with strange names, places with strange names. Extraneous apostrophes cavort with their umlaut buddies in all sorts of unexpected places. The good guys are attractive and the bad guys are ugly. Very black and white stuff. It's the superficial elements of Tolkien, Pratchett, Zelazny, McCaffrey and a host of others, all crammed into a single volume.

I found comfort in familiar characters manipulated with skill through this new land. The vocabulary is fabulous, and the kid appeal is amazing.

That genre is fantasy and the strains are influenced by that boy wizard from England and a certain Hobbit from Middle Earth.Fans of what is called \\"high fantasy,\\" as epitomized by the Lord of the Rings trilogy, will form the core audience for Christopher Paolini's new \\"Inheritance\\" trilogy. While Eragon does not have the epic scale of LOTR, it compares favorably to LOTR in several ways. In writing a single-focus story with the title character Eragon in every scene, Paolini puts an equal emphasis on character and plot development, often delving into Eragon's thoughts. But like Tolkien, he takes his time to create a vividly real mythical world and a very human protagonist.I recommend this book not only to fantasy fans, but also to those who might be new to the genre, or who think they don't like it. This books is less about elves and dragons and quests, than it is about character. And, if prophecies are to be believed, this may develop into one heckuva romance as well.I recommend this book to any young person interested in becoming a writer, for the author began the book when he was just fifteen and was nineteen when it was published. The writing is technically much better written than many adult authors, which makes the young author's acknowledgements an important part of appreciating his effort.Eragon's one negative is actually another similarity to LOTR: an unsatisfying end to book one, which may, suggest the trilogy may be like LOTR, one long, continuous story rather than three standalone books.- KB Shaw, PublisherSPECTRUM Children's Book Clubwww.incwell.com"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Eragon is a fascinating story of a sixteen-year-old farm boy that comes upon a magnificent blue stone while hunting for food for his family.

That night it hatches into a baby dragon! He attempts to keep the dragon secret, but is somehow found out by an evil adversary.Soon enough, Eragon finds himself on a magical quest with the aid of his dragon and an old \\"storyteller\\" named Brom.

With the exciting plot line and great character development, I couldn't put it down. Christoper Paolini creates an excitng story filled with engaging battle scenes and great descriptions of the landscape. It seemed like I was traveling with Eragon and felt his emotions through the entire story. I especially enjoyed flipping to the maps on the inside of both covers to follow Eragon's wandering path through ALAGASIA.I cannot believe a fifteen-year-old could write such a gripping tale! He excellently portrays Eragon and shows how he matures from a farm boy to a young man who learns a great deal as his adventure progresses.

The story is perfect in it's detail and imagination. The reader is caught from the opening sentence and not even released when the book is finished. This is a person who really puts feeling in to what he writes, and clearly loves his work. And the most amazing thing of all, he was only fifteen when he began. At fourteen CDs, Erogon is no brief trip in to fantasy land, and is the first book in a planned trilogy. The time and care given over to any book, not to mention the stamina required is a tall order. I can only think that Christopher Paolini must have been a very special, if unusual teenager. I'd be willing to bet not many of his piers could have written such a masterpiece, even if they'd had the inclination to try.Eragon is a story of a poor farm boy, and his relationship with his dragon Saphira. It all starts simply enough. Eragon discovers a polished blue stone while out hunting, and returns with it to his village, in the hope that he can sell it for some much needed food for his family. When the stone hatches in to a dragon, Eragon raises her secretly in the forest, but his secrecy costs him dearly, and Eragon and Saphira are soon on the run. What starts out as a quest to avenge his family, soon turns in to a discovering of his own destiny. For the dragon riders of old were legendary, and now one has arisen to take up their legacy once again.This is a story filled with magic and adventure, of sorrow and hardship, and of friendship. But above all, it is a voyage of self discovery, and with two other books on the horizon, it promises to be a long journey.

I couldn't put it down [BOTH times I've read it] and I think it is excellent.A lot of this criticism seems to come from the fact that the author is so young - like folks can't resist taking a dig at him for being so successful. The truth is that he IS young - he started writing this book at 15 - the same age his hero is as the book begins. He does a great job writing about his 15 year old hero and it works quite well. His writing is masterful and his command of the english language is absolutely poetic.This is also a *decent* book that you won't have to be afraid to let your kids read - something of an anomoly in modern fiction writing, and that alone sets it apart as superior. Its quite refreshing to read a novel that can stand on its own [and SELL on its own] without using sex to pander to the audience.I think we can expect great things from this author as he grows and matures - but if he never writes anything better than Eragon he has STILL written an excellent modern fantasy classic."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"As I've read here in the reveiws nearly everyone is raving about this book.

I was dubious at first, and spent the first couple chapters analyzing everything looking for evidence of the youth of its author. No doubt there is plenty, and the style is not extremely refined, but it's difficult to keep concentrating on that, because the overall quality is so high and the story so good. Soon I gave up and let myself get swept away into the land of Alagaesia, for indeed, in true Tolkienesque fashion, Paolini creates a genuine secondary world. It has a fairly elaborate geography, an ancient language (not nearly as sophisticated or realistic as Tolkien's, of course, and at times clearly contrived, but overall fairly convincing), a long history many times hinted at and partly explained, and a complex array of races and political entities. Paolini does a good job of borrowing elements from Tolkien and other fantasies, yet maintaining originality--indeed, a good fantasy author should not be creating something totally original at all, for as Tolkien explains in his famous essay, \\"On Fairy-Stories,\\" it is his job to draw pieces out from the great \\"Cauldron of Story\\" and rearrange them into a new, yet familiar tale that then becomes part of the Cauldron. Indeed, Paolini shows himself to be well-educated in much of the literary and mythological background for fairy-stories, or fantasy, particularly in his appropriation of names (Hrothgar, for example, is the name of the dwarf-king). Paolini does an excellent job of never revealing too much at once, but always keeping much of Eragon's surroundings shrouded in mystery--even something as basic as who the good guys are and who the bad guys are is very slow to be unveiled.A couple things that do need improvement (and which I hope to see improve in Books 2 and 3 of the trilogy as his writing style matures): many of the stylistic devices are rather cliched, and the writing never ascends to a level that quite does justice to the emotion and epic scale of the events in the book. In Tolkien, for example, many sentences are so beautiful that they are worth quoting and remembering in and of themselves, irrelevant of context. Such sublimity is rare, however, in Eragon. Also, the POV often is a bit too introspective for a tale of epic scale--Paolini would do better not to relate, verbatim, every thought that passes through Eragon's head.Nevertheless, Paolini succeeds in creating a convincing and alluring alternate world, and of making the reader forget for a time that it is only a fantasy world, and genuinely care about what happens in it; and that is the purpose of fantasy.I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I think some of the other reviewers are missing the point with their harsh criticism of Eragon. Of course it is heavily influenced by other fantasy series, particularly Lord of the Rings. What modern fantasy novel isn't? Of course the author got a lot of free publicity for his book based on his age. That's the reason many of us picked up the book in the first place. To suggest that Paolini got a free ride while writing a weak copycat novel is more than a bit harsh though. He's obviously new to writing, and is still learning the ropes, but I don't think he'd have such a devoted fan base if he were a bad writer.Eragon is a good story, and it was fun to read. Let me repeat that. It was FUN to read. Isn't that the whole point of reading a fantasy novel? I'm not looking to be dazzled by the originality and technical prowess of a 17-year old author. I want to read a cool story with interesting characters that puts a smile on my face and makes me eager to read the next installment. Eragon delivers exactly that.This saga isn't in the same league as Tolkien's Lord of the Rings, George R.R.

Eragon tells the story of a young boy, called Eragon, who finds a mysterious stone. The unusual stone turns out to be a long lost dragon egg. Eragon travels far, with the help of an old storyteller, and throughout their journeys they unravel many mysteries and uncover the past of the dragons and their dragon riders.

It leaves you with unanswered questions that at the last minuet are answered, and they aren't answered in black and white. It is full of surprises and challenges so that when ever a character triumphs greatly he would also lose something. It leaves you sort of hanging at the end of the book but you have got a strong hold.

As a fourteen year old who loves to write, and hopes to publish a book while still in highschool- Chrisopher Paolini is a complete role-model. He has done what I *dream* to do one day.And you have to admit, it is nearly impossible to come up with a true, original idea. I also love his writing style- I keep refering back to his book for adjectives that I can never think of while writing myself.While severe (adult) editors may dislike the book, I recommend it to people of my own age who love reading.Keep in mind that he is not the only writer who has used the ideas of elves, dragons and named swords...

He didn't even add anything new to it.There's a difference between paying homage to something and outright ripping it off. I believe that christopher paolini should be in prison for copyright infringement. He ripped right off Star Wars, which itself wasn't even that good. If you're going to steal ideas, steal GOOD ideas.Okay, I take it back. I've read books far worse than Eragon (for example, maya angelou's books all suck). But that doesn't mean that Eragon should be given leeway. And he shouldn't be given leeway just because he WAS a teenager. Lots of teenagers write great books. For example, Nancy Yi Fan, who became a bestselling author at age 13.I know it's a bit late to post about Eragon, but for those who are about to get into it, I strongly advise you to stay away from this \\"novel\\"."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I bought this book to complete my son's book series.

I have no prior fantasy reading to compare it to, and for that reason I do not understand your critisms. I do see some situations where it could be compared to star wars, but not nearly enough to ruin the story. So, I must say that I can't stop reading this book. I can't wait to read the next chapters.

After a few minutes, I realized this was the author of Eragon (he had told me his name, but it didn't click right away). I was amazed that someone so accomplished was so down-to-earth and gracious. I gave him my card, and within a couple weeks received an autographed copy of Eragon in the mail.I read the book and totally gave into the escapism that a good fantasy novel, film, or video game offers (yes, I'm a 33-year-old woman who plays RPGs every now and then... and I do have a social life).As someone fairly familiar with works of this genre, I recognize that they typically work with the same basic plot and the same character types. As in Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, Chronicles of Narnia, and Dune, a very young person living an ordinary life suddenly has to defeat some horrible evil. And he will have a wise, loveable mentor (Obi Wan, Gandalf, etc.), and he will get a cool weapon, and he will learn how to use magic or wizardry or the Force or some kind of supernatural element to his advantage. The genius of the work comes in how the author manipulates the basic plot, the settings, and the familiar characters (for the more traditional fantasy genre, this means elves and dwarves), to add a new twist on a familiar world. What some reviewers are calling derivation or even plagiarism I'm seeing more as both homages to earlier works (especially with some of the names for places and people) and a respect for what fans want to see in the genre.I like Paolini's world and the characters he's introduced. The story of Riders is something interesting and original, even if it parallels other \\"golden ages\\" in other works (when the Jedi ruled, for example). The relationship between Eragon and Saphira I found provocative - imagining what it would be to share a consciousness with a dragon. In many fantasy works dwarves are the miners who live in the mountains, but I found Farthen-Dur and Trongheim colorful and imaginative. Sometimes the dialogue between Brom and Eragon took proportionately too much of the novel (this is definitely the \\"explaining what's going on and important background details\\" novel of the series, but that's to be expected). Eragon is neither the most likeable nor the most interesting character in the book (in my opinion, Murtagh is the best character in the series), but then, I found the same to be true of Frodo Baggins, Luke Skywalker, and Paul Atreides. Actually, I didn't even like Luke that much, and yet I love Star Wars.If you have a love for the fundamentals of the fantasy genre and want to see them imagined in a new, fresh way, then this is a wonderful book. If you are looking for a profound departure from the fundamentals, best to turn elsewhere. I enjoyed this book - and the rest of the series - very much, and having had the opportunity to meet the author has only made the novel that much more meaningful and enjoyable."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I first read this in the Eighth Grade. I loved it then, and it has only gotten better with age. It reads well, and keeps you interested from the very first chapter. The Characters are intriguing and develop well as the story progresses. The author's description of scenery and characters is outstanding, though sometimes it does get a little long, the story line will keep you hooked up until the very end. I cannot wait to re-read Eldest, and read for the first time the last two books."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"For a first book this is quite good. Paolini does use a typical setting--the farmboy with hidden talents and destiny. The characters he encounters are fairly typical fantasy types as well (even if they come with different names) You will find Goblin-like creatures, elves, undead, wizards. All this is quite fun. The story moves fairly quickly, the plot has just enough variation to keep you reading, if not particularly surprised. (If you need the unexpected read George R.R. Martin instead). If you feel like a quick light fantasy read this is your book. If you are looking for something deep with complex characters, intricate plotline and unusual creatures, look elsewhere."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"In this book, Luke Skywalker, um, I mean, Eragon, raised by farmer on the edge of the [Galactic] Empire but of uncertain (but surely noble) parentage, is trained to be a Jedi Knight, um, I mean, a Dragon Rider, by a former Knight/Rider, Obi Wan Kenobi, um, I mean, Brom. Eragon wants to be a Knight/Rider because he can then fight the powers of evil, including the Emperor and his half-human minion Darth, um, I mean, Darza. Eragon must go off on a quest to avenge the murder of his parent, which leads him to dwarves who are good at tunneling, and elves who have retreated from the world of men and who live beyond the sea but are very good at making swords. He also meets up with orcs, um, I mean, urgals, and super-orcs called uruk-hai, um, I mean, kells, all of whom need to be directly controlled by an evil mind or else they fight aimlessly. During this quest, Eragon also learns how to be a wizard and to do magic by using Tolkienian Middle English or quasi-Celtic phrases instead of Harry Potter&#65533;s Latin, and by aiming his wand, um, I mean, the special mark on his palm, in the right direction.

For example, Eragon's connection with Saphira is exactly like Jakkin's with his dragons in Jane Yolen's A Sending of Dragons, a book that I much preferred. And the way Saphira speaks seems much too human for a dragon. Even the way Eragon talks to himself (italicized, of course) seems awkward on paper.Also, the way Paolini randomly inserts rough paragraph-long imagery really irritates me. He obviously has a stack of long and impressive words at his disposal but doesn't know how to apply them artistically.As I said before, a gripper. It may have been the only thing that kept me flipping pages, but now, rereading bits of it, I realize how choppy the writing style is."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"The book is good... if you haven't read some other books! If you hve read the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy it is easy to know many things come from there. First of all, Farthen Dur sound similar to Barad Dur. Also the \\"adventure\\" starts when Eragon finds an egg and evil things with black cloaks chases him away. The adventure in lord of the rings starts when Frodo inherits the one ring and evil things with black cloaks gets him out of the Shire. Later in Eragon, eragon meets dwarves and, just like lord of the rings, they use axes for battle, have braided hair, are strong, live in mountians, and have a suit of mail on. In both books elves are fair and live in beautiful places in the forests. Eragon sounds like Aragon. One of Eragon's companions, Brom, is similar to Aragon because they are both powerful in some way that was unknowned to Eragon (Eragon) and Frodo (Lord of the Rings). Arya (Eragon) sounds like Arwen (Lord of the rings). Also, just like Lord of the rings where defeating Sauron won the battle, Eragon wins a battle by killing a Shade. Shades are very similar to Black riders. They both evil, have sharp senses, and are good in battle. Even though if stabed in one spot they die, Shades come back, just like black riders. Urgals and kulls are nearly the same as Orcs and uru-kai(spelling?). both are the foundations of the enemies army. There are probably more similarities with Lord of the rings because hardly anything suprised me because I was thinking of Lord of the Rings most of the time. If this had come out before the Lord of the Ring it would have been way better. However if have a choice, I would read the Lord of the Rings first because it doesn't suddenly change the subject as suddenly as Eragon. This is why I would recommend the Lord of the Rings more than Eragon."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I picked this book up at a Barnes and Noble bookstore (... uhh, is it taboo to dare mention B&N; on amazon??? ... probably but too late now! ). It was under their \\"staff picks\\" section with the recommendation \\"forget Harry Potter, read THIS!!!\\"Well, I have read Harry Potter, and let me assure you, this is no Harry Potter!However, neither is it a completely worthless read, either. It is certainly grounded in Tolkien middle earth type settings. Elves, dwarves, etc. The dragon part is a new twist. The story goes something like this: Boy finds dragon egg, dragon hatches, boy is thrust into a serious adventure not of his choosing. It is a fairly rudimentary plot, with obviously raw writing, but there are still compelling parts to the story, and I would recommend it.Is it on the same level as stories such as the LOTR trilogy, or Ender's Game, or the Foundation series??? No. Does it have a template feel to it? Sort of.

I must say I'm disappointed. Even ignoring the rip-off factor, it was still disappointing. I don't think the author played to the stregnth of the story very well. This is a Dragon book, right? But for large portions of the book the dragon is little more than a pack animal that occasionally acts like a teenage girl, it just doesn't seem to make sense. The dialogue between the dragon and the boy is almost painfully cheesy and really underwhelms. This is definitely more of a teen or pre-teen kind of fantasy.That's not to say there are no positives. The Brom and Murdaugh characters are reasonably interesting, and managed to get me through it. After a tedious middle, it does pick up towards the end, but it's kind of too little, too late. I will say that the author has at least left himself a strong enough base that if he decides to get away from the Star Wars plot he could do something decent with it. After all, he is young and could be expected to improve as he gets older.Anyway, I'm not planning on reading part 2, though my friend may talk me into it.

My point is, while these authors may be pulp writers, their work at least is entertaining. Eragon is not. I didn't believe Mr. Paolini was 15 when he started writing this book after I finally finished it. I thought he must have been much younger--perhaps 9 or 10. It's REALLY that bad.

Everybody's entitled to his or her opinion, and my opinion is that Paolini didn't mean this to be a children's book, if there was mention of rape in the book. While it isn't the worst book ever written (some of those spewed out by Publish America are pretty wretched), it certainly is far from becoming a classic like, say, Jules Verne or Robert Lewis Stephenson. Filled with cliches and unnecessary description, along with avoidance (for the most part) of the word 'said', this book was way too predictable and lumbering for me.

A pair of twisted horns grew above their small ears.\\"Eragon, Inheritance is written in third person.

At the beginning of the story, the young hero finds a polished blue stone that turns out to be a dragon egg.After the dragon hatches out, Eragon is cast into a situation that he only dimly understands. Fortunately, guidance is available from various sources, including a storyteller named Brom who turns out to be much more than he appears, and the boy is a fast learner. By the end of the book, he has been through a great deal and overcome some fearsome challenges. The stage is set for further adventures in the volumes to come.Now why would anyone want to read such a patently unrealistic story? The answer, I suppose, is that it is fun to feel liberated from real life, if only in one's imagination. Forget a world that revolves around the daily news, getting to school or work, and the latest technology; here is a world where ancient symbols, deeds of yore, and magic discovered over the ages exert a powerful influence. Also, forget about moral equivalence; the distinction between good and evil in this world is satisfyingly clear-cut.Paolini's fantasy world in \\"Eragon\\" resembles the one that J. R. Tolkien created, and I would say \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" is a considerably more polished and compelling work. This book is also not up to the standard that J. K. Rowling set in the Harry Potter books.Still, there are some dramatic twists and turns in the story and it is told well enough to hold one's interest. Considering that Paolini started this book at the age of 15, I do not think one should be too critical about its imperfections.There are parts of the book, moreover, in which the writer shows surprising maturity and perception for someone of his age. When the leader of the human rebels (Ajihad) briefs Eragon on the political stresses between the humans, dwarves and elves in the rebel alliance, for instance, his observations seem quite astute.My recommendation: read this book if you have already read \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" and want to read another series along the same general lines. \\"Eragon\\" is suitable for preteen or teenage readers, or for adults who want to know what the younger generation is reading. If nothing else, this book will provide the necessary background to appreciate the highly acclaimed sequel (\\"Eldest\\") and later books in the series (\\"Brisingr\\" will come out shortly)."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I think \\"Eragon\\" is a very good book.

Between Jedi Mind tricks and Eragon's training to use magic I couldnt believe all the similarities between these three entities. Overall a good read"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"In 2002 I was 16 and a sophomore in high school. I was the Manhattan finalist for a storytelling festival. I was writing, mostly poetry. The year before I had been named runner up in a contest held by the Poetry Society of America and had the poem I entered read on the radio. I used to feel pretty good about those accomplishments until I read Christopher Paolini's bio on his first book.In 2002 Christopher Paolini was 15 and a high school graduate. So, of course, the next obvious step was to write a novel. Which is why readers now have Eragon, the latest in a long line of dragon-centric fantasies (I just made that term up). This novel is the first in the Inheritance Trilogy (Eldest is already out and Brisingr is due for release soon). It was also made into a movie in 2006 that I enjoyed quite a bit even before I found its excellent tagline: \\"You are stronger than you realize. Wiser than you know. What was once your life is now your legend.\\"The reason I mention the movie at all is because this is one of the only books I can think of where I saw the movie adaptation before I read the book. I really liked both and found it interesting to be motivated to read a book because of the movie. Before I review the book I just want to get this out of my system: Eragon was really good and I enjoyed it, but it did at times sound like it was written by a fifteen-year-old. I'm not saying that to be petty or because of sour grapes--I just really think that's the case.In addition to mentioning his age, Paolini's back flap bio mentions that he has an abiding love of fantasy that subsequently motivated him to write his own fantasy novel. For that reason, Eragon owes an obvious debt to some of the fantasy big shots. Like Tamora Pierce's books (and Gail Carson Levine's), this one has a medieval-esque setting. The most obvious similarities that I noticed lie between this book and Ursula K. Le Guin's A Wizard of Earthsea and J. R. R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings books (and The Hobbit too). Obviously, then, if you like those books you will like Eragon. At the same time, though, these similarities did leave me wishing there were more \\"acceptable\\" ways to write a fantasy setting. Maybe that's me.More than an event book where events are central to the plot and the story moves from event to event, this is a journey book. Stuff happens, but most of the novel is spent traveling. In a sense, the entire book is a journey to the end which I assume leads to more revelations which will be found in the second book in the trilogy.The book's journey starts with its title character, Eragon, a fifteen-year-old youth living in a rural town in the land of Alagaesia. Once a place of glory where dragons and their riders kept peace across the country, the Empire is now ruled by a cruel king called Galbatorix. Such concerns are far from Eragon's daily concerns though. Living with his uncle and cousin, Eragon's days are spent helping his family farm their land and prepare for winter.All of that changes when Eragon returns from a hunting trip with a mysterious stone. Soon enough, he realizes the stone is actually an egg. A dragon egg. The presence of this new dragon will not only change the course of Eragon's life but also the path of the entire Empire. Thus Eragon is set on a new path with only his dragon, an old storyteller and a mysterious sword to help him find his way.And that, really, is what this book is about: Eragon finding his way as he learns what being a Rider, and dare I say being a hero, really means. One of the subtler things I liked about the writing is that when Paolini begins this story, his protagonist is clearly a boy even if by Alagaesian standards he's only a year from manhood. By the end of the novel, though, Eragon is a man. The writing changes subtly to reflect this important change from beginning to end.Eragon is literally finding his way too--the novel features a lot of long, perilous journeys and long, dangerous battles. All of which were good to read but did leave me burnt out when I finally made my way to the end of my paperback copy (on page 497). Sometimes it's just surprising how long it can take to read a long book.For fear of providing accidental spoilers, that's really all I have to say. Once I got over the fact that I did not graduate high school at fifteen or write a novel, the book was not at all depressing. Eragon features some great characters (Brom to name one) and some of the scariest villains seen in recent fantasies. I have high hopes for the next installment in the trilogy once I get my hands on it."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Eragon is a good book to read when your absoultely desperate for something simple to do. the plot is so elementary, you dont have to struggle at all to follow along. there are no surprises whatsoever and is about as exciting as this review is. the characters are basic and rudimentarily developed. the whole idea is platitudinous and the layout of the story is vapid and predictable. even the sequencing is exactly what one would expect. if your in the mood for a book that follows the fantasy formula we have all come to know and hate with all our hearts, then this is the novel for you. the best thing i can say about this book is that it is well written and moves at a fast pace, so even if you find it as drab as i did, it wont take up that much of your life."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Title: EragonAuthor: Christopher PaoliniPublisher, Date: Alfred A. Knopf, 2003.Pages: 497Genre: mythicalFry Readability Reading Level: 6th gradeSynopsis: Eragon is a teenage boy growing up in a village hit with hard times. His family often struggles to find food, and must fend for themselves in dangerous grounds. The story begins as Eragon finds a smooth beautiful rock while hunting in the woods. Eragon, not aware of the magic it may possess, tries hard to sell it or trade it for food. After a failed attempt at ridding himself of the rock, Eragon takes it home for the night.During the night, however, the rock hatches into a small, beautiful dragon. Eragon, knowing that dragon eggs only hatch once a person whom they feel an attachment with touches it realizes that he has now become connected to the dragon. Eragon is suddenly forced into the life of a Dragon Rider, a dangerous and at times lonely life. Dragon Riders are known as fierce and tough warriors. Many people fear the power that Dragon Riders contain, and seek to kill them or bring them onto their side.Eragon must now protect his secret from his family and village, all while ensuring that his dragon gets enough to eat, and has time for exercise and communication. However, he cannot keep his secret forever. Once the truth is revealed, Eragon's family is attacked, and he must forever live with the pain of losing his loved ones all because of his secret.Eragon then sets out on a long and perilous journey where must choose between right and wrong, and must help his friends yet battle with the pain that he cannot help everyone. Eragon's adventure leads him throughout the world as they travel great miles in search of the truth and those that killed his family.Endless battles, consistent new struggles and the growth of Eragon highlight this story as a very enjoyable read. However, it is important to highlight possible negative elements of this book. Eragon, while enjoyable, is a very long read and might not be for everyone. It contains discussions of death, torture and numerous depictions of pain and suffering. Additionally, Eragon is a very mythical book. This book is not suggested for individuals who enjoy real life stories, or more emotional drama. The book is focused more around battles and fighting, than around emotions and feeling.I thoroughly enjoyed the book. I found it very hard to predict what was going to happen to Eragon next, which made the book exciting and unexpected. Additionally, Eragon and his dragon are great together. Humor is placed into the book just the right amount to keep you laughing without taking away from the battle scenes."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"\\"I found the stone both beautiful and frightening.

If I had learned anything from the old stories, it was to treat magic, and those who used it, with great caution.\\" Eragon makes this statement on page 8 of this exciting fantasy novel by Christopher Paolini. This sentence showed me that Eragon has a very interesting story dealt with magic and mystery that will be far from ordinary.Eragon tells the story of a young farm boy who is living with his uncle and cousin. He discovers a giant secret while hunting in the spine for his families' food that will change his life forever.Eragon is an amazing book that anyone should read especially if you like fantasy novels with tons of action in them. I really enjoyed this book because it holds your interest the whole time while reading it and it also throws in some surprising twists on the way. It is a story of how a young boy, Eragon finds a mysterious stone hunting for food, and the stone happens to be a dragons egg. He learns to live with the dragon and how to care for it as he is being taught by his uncle on his way to get revenge the creatures that killed his uncle."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Eragon is a book about a boy who finds a blue dragon egg. The egg hatches into a dragon he names Saphira. Toghether, they travel with a man named Brom, and a fierce warrior named Murtaugh, to find the secret city of the Varden. They feel that they can use Eragon's fighting and their magic to help the Varden defeat the evil king, Galbotorix.One of my two favorite parts of Eragon are when Eragon finds out how Brom knows all he knows about dragons and magic. Brom knew that Eragon would need to know everything about the powers he had possesion of to be able to help the Varden. Also, I really enjoyed the fighting between Eragon and the Shade. It was a difficult fight, but Eragon knew he could win. The only way to kill a Shade was to stab it in the heart.Eragon is easily one of my favorite books, and I have read a lot of books. It's a book you never want to put down. You never stop wanting to read the next part. It's a great book for people who really like both adventure and fantasy books. Also, it has a lot of great fighting scenes. The battles have great discriptions, and you feel like you're in it.

Overall, the prose tries too hard to be elegant, and I found it distracting. Names and language variations are forced and unconvincing, and as a reader I wasn't sold on the idea that there was a history or culture behind it all. Scene and idea transitions aren't always smooth, and logical story progression is occasionally lacking. The author often introduces details with an importance that is entirely misguided, as he typically passes by them within the course of a few sentences, and left me with a feeling of, \\"Why the heck was THAT so important?\\"Plotwise, there was little that isn't integral to J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings, David Eddings' Belgariad, or Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman's Dragonlance series. It's not that the story isn't interesting--it is--but it will definitely be enjoyed more by a younger reader not quite ready for the full adult fantasy genre.This struck me as an introductory book, a decent effort by a teenager, but obviously a teenaged effort. It is fairly friendly to younger ages in terms of violence and appropriateness, but tricky where names and languages are concerned. Adult readers who are hoping for a successful blend of juvenile/young adult fiction and fantasy may be disappointed, but the story could be a good gateway into the fantasy genre."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Paolini was obviously entranced by LOTR, and almost wrote a fanfiction story about it.

J.R. Tolkien is a clear example. He took the elves, urgals A.K.A. Uruk-Hai and dragons from Tolkiens' well written books. Not to mention lots of other different material Paolini so rudely stole from The Lord of the Rings. If he lacks the skill of a writer he should just leave it to other people who actually have that gift. He should not steal other brialliant writers' work."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I will begin by saying this. Yes, this book draws from the master, Tolkien. Yes, it also draws from other books.However, I also believe it has a level of originality. The dragon twist combined with the political organizations could have been interesting. Paolini clearly has a good imagination, both in creating new ideas and in combining new ideas with already formed ones (hence the great similarities to Tolkien). This trilogy could have been great. Paolini could have been great. Notice I say could.The thing is, despite his creativity and gift of plot ideas, he doesn't have a good grasp of the actual writing. He has trouble taking what he is thinking of and writing it down. Weak dialouge, over description, and sometimes monotonous scenes drag an amazing plot down. Of course, this isn't as noticeable on the first reading. You buy the book, plop down to read it, and go through it. Conclusion: A bit \\"copy-catty\\" sure but pretty interesting. You think it's ok. Then the second reading. That's when you start noticing some of the literary problems. Once you begin to read it a second time, and your mind is no longer occupied with the suspense and wonder of what will happen next. The plot is no longer that interesting and you begin to notice the actual writing. Therefore you begin to notice the mistakes. A good writer, say Tolkien or JK Rowling, will keep you interested even in the fifth or sixth reading. Paolini...not so much. He could have been great. He could have been REALLY great.

I'm a big fan of well-written fantasy, so I wanted to get a copy before the movie came out. It started out pretty well, but soon it became a drudgery. Not only is it pretty well ripped off of excellent fantasy, but the concept of magic is very poorly written, there are some rediculous scenes (such as Murtagh killing a slave trader who threatened to kill them, and then Eragon turning into a self-righteous minister of justice and demanding that retribution be paid for a wrongful death...What???), the names were very strange and sounded like the author just jumbled up some letters and came up with whatever sounded interesting (Galbatorix? Doesn't quite roll off the tongue like Sauron does it?), and no flow at all.I was extremely disappointed. I do realize that this was written by a young man for the 'tweener' age group, but well-written fantasy often appeals to many age groups, and this is niether well-written, nor appealing.

Tolkien, then add a generous helping of Anne McCaffrey's dragon-riders and a few random shreds of Garth Nix for good measure.Obviously originality is not Christopher Paolini's strong suit, and it shows in his fantasy debut \\"Eragon,\\" which was penned in his tender teenage years. It swims in fantasy cliches and stilted dialogue, but there's a certain awkward charm in Paolini's fantasy world. The biggest problem is, simply put, Paolini's cardboard cutout of a self-insert hero, Eragon.The titular character is lucky enough to stumble across a strange blue stone while hunting on the Spine. After failing to sell it, Eragon finds that it's actually a dragon egg, and the baby blue dragon inside selects him to hatch for and remain with forever. All the Dragon Riders were killed off by Evil King Galbatorix long ago, except for the weird old recluse Brom, who becomes Eragon's mentor.And Luke, I am your father... wait, wrong story.When Galbatorix's men destroy Eragon's home and family, Brom and Eragon flee to find the mysterious rebels known as the Varden. But Eragon's dreams are being haunted by the beautiful elf Arya, and the little band sets out to save her. Eragon and his dragon Saphira learn many things -- and make new allies -- the journey to the Varden brings them a terrible (and totally predictable) loss, and leads them to Eragon's first battle.Lofty elves, humble farm boys, ghastly goblinesque creatures, mystical women, special swords, evil tyrants who are evil because they just are, evil minions, wise mentors, and telepathic dragons in a variety of colors. Christopher Paolini never met a fantasy cliche that he didn't like. And as a result, \\"Eragon\\" is dripping with Tolkien and Lucas-style trappings, right down to the hero's suspiciously Tolkienian name.Paolini paints these typical sword-and-sorcery stories with rather stilted but promising prose. \\"Eragon\\" has some raw rookie potential, and you can detect Paolini's enthusiasm as he explores his invented fantasy land, much the way many other teenagers have done after reading high fantasy and yearning to explore their own made-up worlds. There's just not much that is new or unique about this story, although Paolini throws in some attempted humorous quirks like a weird fortune-teller.The biggest problem with Paolini's writing is that Eragon is portrayed as a noble, brave, compassionate soul with a brilliant destiny ahead of him. Well, frankly he shows no nobility, bravery or compassion, and the many characters who gasp in admiration of him does not make him any more impressive. He's a glaring self-insert, with all the dimension of a cardboard standee, and about as sendearing.The supporting characters are not much better -- Brom is too brief a character to make much of an impact, and he seems to exist mainly to get Our Hero up to snuff in information and ability. And the love interest Arya is glorified only for her otherworldly beauty... which is all she has. Eragon's adoration of her seems unfounded, because her personality is chilly at best, snotty and autocratic at worst.Christopher Paolini's \\"Eragon\\" is pretty much what you'd expect of a teenage boy's fantasy novel -- plenty of Lucas and Tolkien echoes, and a style that hasn't gained a sense of humor about itself."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"People need to give Paolini a break. He isn't Tolkien, or Howard, or even Leiber or Donaldson...but in my estimation he's near equal to Brooks, Jordan, and probably Pratchet too...all of whom are not just PUBLISHED, but also BESTSELLERS.While I agree with some of the comments and observances of Capossere, the reviewer below, I have to take exception to one of his statements-\\"What he probably shouldn't have gotten was a publishing contract.\\"As if a publishing contract were something only literary geniuses deserve. The local Huddle House has a publishing contract with a coloring book company.I find the statement to be almost an advocation of censorship. Paolini definitely deserves a publishing contract and so does Terry Brooks, no matter who they copied or or how untalented we might think they are. Why? because they make the publisher an absurd amount of money. If a publishing house only published talents equal to Pynchon and Faulkner, they'd go broke. That material is over the heads of most entertainment motivated readers. Comic books have publishing contracts because comic books sell. Paolini is interesting enough that a high percentage of the people who read him enjoy him and some even want to read more, and he's a hard working marketer to boot.Publishing is so cheap that I say let every book written be available. Somebody might like it. Maybe one day readers will start thinking for themselves and read an excerpt to decide whether they want to buy a book, instead of being told what to read by the media.Why not pick on someone more deserving like whoever wrote those hideous \\"Dragon Slayer Academy\\" rags?

While I think it is unfortunate that others do not appreciate it, I do understand--especially the borrowing from other authors. I hate to say it but that's what literature and art is. There's a term for it - intertextuality (yes that's a real word).I thought the plot of Eragon is very well developed. It's a little long and drawn out in a few sections, but the author manages to keep the readers in some form of suspense throughout the book. The final chapters are very climactic. By the time the book was done, I felt like I had traveled with Eragon through the entire book.His characters are very well developed. Many minor characters were somewhat flat, but Eragon and Brom certainly were. I especially loved Saphira's characterization. I enjoyed the characters overall. I think Eragon was a very believable character. His life started out as a quiet farm boy but gets thrown into a world of violence and destruction. He did not expect any of it to happen, yet by the end he seems to accept his place in the world.Yes this book borrows from the fantasy realm, but I think it does so very well. I have only read a small portion of fantasy, but I am an avid science fiction fan and enjoy books from all genres. I did not read this book as a fantasy fanatic, but I enjoyed this book. My brother reads tons of fantasy and yet he appreciated this book as well.I would like to point out that the inside front cover of the book quotes Anne McCaffrey: \\"Full praise to Eragon, I want more! A winner...tip of the hat to the young master Paolini.\\" This is the author that one review mentions a lot.

I am looking forward to reading the next in the series. I also plan to read this to my son."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Eragonby Christopher PaoliniWhen you first pick up the book Eragon, you might have picked it because of the beautifully decorated cover, or because your teacher forced you to do a book report, but as soon as you start reading the first few pages of the book, you'll be addicted. Why? The book is a fast paced fantasy book that does justice to its category and a little of others too. The setting is in Algaesia , a land where an evil king is the antagonist and rules the people with an iron grip. The land's only hope of freedom then falls on a farm boy named Eragon, the protagonist, who stumbles upon the legacy of the legendary dragon riders when he finds a dragon egg in the forest. He is then pushed into a world where he realizes he holds an extremely powerful position, the first of the new dragon riders. The evil king, Galbatorix, attempts to find and capture him and The Varden, rebels who live in the mountains, want to find him as well to fight for control of the land. Eragon has to make all these important decisions as well as complete his training with an eccentric storyteller, Brom. This would capture the attention of teens between 12-16 as the action happens very quickly and it is all about fighting, magic and suspense. This book is something like the popular trilogy Lord Of The Rings as their both in the same category and they share the same basic plot. I chose this book because I have always had love for fantasy books and this book is no exception. I also like to imagine what would happen in a world of magic and adventure. The best parts of this book are the fight scenes and the scenes where Eragon and friends always manage to closely escape the enemy's grasp as those scenes are described in a such a detailed manner that although the words that Christopher Paolini uses are not \\"big\\" at all, they still can interest the audience. I hope that the description I gave makes you want to jump right out of that chair and get a copy, just as it made me do!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"All the reviews say this book is \\"cliche\\" but personally thats exactly what makes a fatasy worht reading, is you can say dwarf, and everyone knows its a stout lil person with long beard and a war hammer who is rock dwelling, what makes me mad is when someone tries to make a fantasy character something its not. but truthfully he does create and add his own element to the story, such as his villianous characters who are very original. If you want something that isn't original yet created in the typical fantasy element read and enjoy this book. Personally i couldnt put it down, and there are very few books that i can say that about, as a busy eighteen year old i made time for Eragon, and will pre order my copy of Eldest, book two.PS detailed, excelent vocabulary, and fluid reading, easy to visilize in the minds eye.

Ok, it is a little similar to other fantasy stuff, but it has it's own twist to it. All in all, it is a good book.

It is Good. So buy it."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Aside from the common criticism that Eragon's plot is taken practically scene for scene from Star Wars IV, it's important to mention that, while this series is aimed at kids, it's not really appropriate for kids. The first book is mostly tame except for a murdered baby and a hint at attempted rape. But I stopped halfway through the second one. Here's why:1. Eragon's teacher presents stupid philosophical ideas such- logic is more important than morality- there is no existence beyond death- humans are not essentially different from other animals- marriage and chastity are not really important2. Along the lines of that chastity point, there's an implied sexual encounter and - this is where I stopped reading - Eragon gets healed by a wound by watching two girls dance while wearing nothing but a tatoo.The second book was also much slower than the first. So, while the first book really is basically okay, I'd avoid it because it's not satisfying by itself and the sequel isn't worth reading."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This is an absolutely amazing book, yet it is extremely unoriginal. Copying what one reviewer said, it is clear that he was 15 when he wrote this. Every page is full of cliches. I don't know if you have seen the entire starwars, but the basic plot for the first movie is exactly the same as Eragon (by the way, does that name remind you of anyone)Basic plot= A servant of an evil emperor attacks, with an army at his disposal, a convoy bearing an object of power to a rebellion against the Empire. The servant captures the convoy and its leader, but the leader (a princess, no less) sends the object away in hopes that it will fall into the hands of a wise old wizard, who is the last of his kind. The object is found by a poor farm boy, whose family (not parents but uncle) is killed as a result, leaving him nothing to stay behind for. He joins the wizard on a quest, as well as a rogue who has no love for the \\"empire.\\" They save the princess, then the three flee to the rebels. This could be used to describe the first Star Wars movie, and no one would know the difference.Also, the names of many people and places copy Lord of the Rings.Arya - Arwen, ArdaArdwen - ArwenIsenstar - IsengardMithrim - Mithrim or mithrilEragon - AragornAngrenost - Angrenost, the Sindarin name for IsengardMorgothal - MorgothElessari - ElessarFurnost - FornostHadarac Desert - Harad DesertMelian - MelianVanir - ValinorEridor - EriadorImiladris - ImladrisUndin - Fundin/UdunAlso, Brom and Obi-Wan are almost exactly the same also. Think about it, old wise guy, the last of his kind, teaches a farm boy his tricks, swordplay, etc.Brom's sacrifice for Eragon also mirrors Obi-Wan's sacrifice for LukeEven in the second book Eldest, there are many similarities to the second Star Wars; the farm boy leaves the rebels after fighting a battle to train with an old hermit in the jungle ( Yoda in Star Wars, and the old dragon rider in Eragon) There the farm boy undergoes a life-changing experience, and later participates in another great battle to aid his friends when he sees a vision. He deuls a powerful enemy, only to be defeated, and then learns that that enemy is a family member and that one of the enemie's lord's main commander is his father (Vader, Morzan, Morzan, Vader)Overall, this is a truly great book, but that is to be expected when it is pretty much an exact copy of one of the world's most famous fiction stories. Most people think that this book copies Lord of the Rings, but it really copies Star Wars"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I purchased Eragon because the prospect of reading a published work by an author that began it's writing at age 15 piqued my curiosity. I was pleasantly surprised at the entertainment value of this one. I'm a bit of a drago-phile so it didn't hurt that the plot revolves almost entirely around a dragon, but even aside from that it is just a fun read. It doesn't have the depth of high fantasy (nor the breadth), but that means that it is a book that can be enjoyed by fantasy fans and mainstream fans alike. If you're looking for epic fantasy, there are better places to go, but for great all-around entertainment, this is a keeper."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I read Eragon because it was for a long-term book report for my English teacher. This book is a good book. If you are into adventure, fantasy, and magic, I would recommend this book. Eragon, by Christopher Paolini, is a story about a boy named Eragon. Eragon lives in a place called Alagasia. All of the places are ruled under a king named Galbatorix. One day, he finds a strange rock in The Spine and doesn't know what its purpose is. A few nights after he found the rock, Eragon is awoken in the middle of the night by a strange sound. He looks at the rock and notices that it's moving, then it hatches. Eragon sees that the hatchling is a dragon, which were thought to be extinct in Alagasia. He names it Saphira, a name which he got from a trader. When Eragon pets her, his palm then has a hardened silver oval on it. A few days later, Eragon's life was changed when he saw that his parents are dead and decides to get revenge on the strangers that had done this. Before he leaves, he teams up with an old storyteller named Brom. He knew that Eragon had a dragon even before Eragon had told him. They travel off to find the one who murdered his parents. During their journey, Brom teaches Eragon the ancient language. The ancient language was used to cast spells. Casting spells requires a silver palm and energy. When Eragon did magic, he would use up some energy. Later on, a man named Murtagh joins Brom and Eragon. They have to face armies of Urgals, which are creatures that are strong and evil, Kull, which are Urgals but stronger, and Shades, which are spell casters that allow evil spirits take over their body. When they reach the dwarf city of Farthen Dr, Galbatorix's army tracks them down to the city. When the army arrives, the dwarves, Eragon, and Saphira have the battle of a lifetime. In the end, Eragon is a good book."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Wow. I've never seen so much \\"borrowing\\" done. It's amazing!In my opinion, this should not be allowed to happen, but evidently I must be in the minority.

There are borrowings from every major work of fantasy and most minor ones. It's really distracting as you attempt to read.

It has a unique way of wanting you to keep on reading. When your not reading it, you just want to read it again to see what happens in the next chapter. The book's chapters end in ways that make you want to find out what happens next. The book does that in every chapter, so its not boring and you decide to skip on to another book. This book is about a boy named Eragon, who later on finds and keeps a Dragon! The Dragons name is, Saphira. Saphira is very protective of Eragon at first but after a while, they go for wild adventures in the cool book. The book has a Fantasy way of majic, and luck. It also has it's negatives. The only negative i would say, would be that it takes a while to add up to the end of how the story will and when take place. This book is simply amazing.

Eragon finds a dragon egg in the spine (a magical woods people call cursed)and takes the egg back to his uncle's house outside the town of Carvahall.

Galbatorax was the ruled of the empire which was where Eragon was living. Eragon was hunting the Ra'Zac because they had burned down his farm. Eragon was the last of the dragon riders and has a dragon named Saphira. I think Christopher Paolini wrote this book to teach that it is always good to be true and believe in yourself. And that when you set your mind to something, Anything is possible. This is a book i think people would like to read if they are into sci-fi or fantasy things. A line i liked that Christopher Paolini used in Eragon is, \\"Then Saphira turned Broms grave into crystal\\". I liked that line because there is nothing else like it in the story. It also takes the reader back into the beginning of the book when Saphira tells Eragon that dragons are capable of all sorts of things that even they don't know of. He also used the line, \\" The crystal made Broms body reserved for as long as it stood and was clear enough to see right through to look at Brom\\".

It's action-packed. Well, that's about the only good thing about it, in my humble opinion.Christopher Paolini shows a lot of talent for a man of his age, and here's hoping he's gained experience with Eragon and his future novels will be better. However, much of the book's hype is about the author (\\"The author was only seventeen?\\" \\"A seventeen-year-old wrote a book that long?\\") rather than the actual book.Eragon is full of fantasy cliches. It seemed to me like a mix of the Lord of the Rings and Anne McAffrey's Riders of Pern series. I have yet to see something original in the book.Something that really erks me is the artificial languages in the book, which Christopher Paolini, judging from interviews, is all-too proud of. They are hardly original, or even thought out. I have honestly seen thirteen-year-old boys create better, and more original, languages. No one seems to notice the languages have no real grammar and the Ancient Language is a rip-off of Old Norse.That said, Eragon does give hope to aspiring writers.

I'm sure Christopher's writing will improve with time.While I don't think it holds a candle to the Harry Potter series, I'm happy to have found another book that will allow my son to transition from the more simplistic fantasy books (i.e. Deltora Quest series) to the more advanced (Earthsea, Lord of the Rings...)."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"While I applaud the kid's efforts and see a fine writing future for him, I must point out that this book is a regurgitation of every other major fantasy series to date. If it were not in fact his parent's publishing company I doubt he would have been published. The story itself is cute, but the writer is young and needs many more years of polishing before he can reach the standards of those authors he's parroting in this book. It's quite sad that there is nothing new in this book. I had hoped for better."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I purchased this book soley for the fact that the success of Eragon was largely based on the hype surrounding the author's, Christopher Paolini, young age during the time of the novel's writing. I'm also a dedicated fantasy/sci-fi writer (a highschool junior) whose work will never be published, and call it an ego thing perhaps, but I wanted to see how this critically acclaimed novel compared to my own work. I was also fully aware of the several reviews making Eragon out to be nothing more than a poorly written rehash of several mainstream fantasy novels, and yet my curiosity urged me to drop the fifteen dollars required to read it...I was dissapointed. Massively.The book is rife with glaring grammatical errors that even I, someone who is horrible at proof reading, could pick out while reading. Also, his selection of words is suspect at best. It almost seems as if a highschool vocabulary book was used as a refrence to plug in as many sophisticated sounding words in place of simpler words. The problem is that sometime these words are used inappropiately, making the sentences in question sound down right ridiculous at times.Perhaps I could overlook that as my own writing is periodically victim to the same mistakes, but I can not ignore the blatant cliches and \\"borrowing\\" from other fantasy books. You have your stereotypical boy, Eragon, whose village is destroyed by an evil empire and is destined to save the world with a dragon he coinicidentially found (he has secret magical powers too), fall in love with the elven maiden, etc. etc. I struggled to find a single original element within the entire story.I suppose the book isn't completely without redemption. It was long afterall, and while I didn't think of it as a good fantasy book, I did satisfy my curiosity as to the quality of the book. It also leaves me with the dillema if I should bother pursuing Eragon's sequel. More things to think about.In conclusion, I can't honestly recommend this book to anyone except hardcore fantasy readers who like extremly thick books, or to people who can endure repetitive fantasy cliches without flinching. To the rest, look elsewhere."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I think this is a great book! As I read the book, there were many sad times that Eragon delt with, but he delt with it very bravely. When I read this book, I could imagine the whole book in my head. It was as if I was seeing the movie instead of reading the book! I cannot wait until Elders (the second bok) comes out! I bet it will be really good! I think Eragon is the best book I have ever read. I would still read it over and over and still imagine the pictures. This was a very interesting book! I suggest to all the kids and adults who like adeventerous books! This was a great book!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I give Eragon 5 star rating because of many things but let me explain why I do not give it any less and also I want to answer a few points raised by other reviewers who seemed quite disappointed. There is common redicule about it being a copy of other works in many way, I ask you, how different would a fantasy story on middle earth ( or similar setting ) would get, if not for Dragons, Magic, Wizards/Sorcerors/Magicians, Sowrds, Elves, Dwarfs and other magical creatures? Also whats wrong with the fact that the author wishes to achieve a lyrical style which sounds somewhat like Mr. Tolkien, its a good ambition as far as I see it.Now for the book, although there are some things which do not fit quite well but the critics should realise that the book's main audience are the yound minds who do not care if words like \\"stuff\\" are used or sometimes, minutes or hours are mentioned (which doesnt properly fit in owing to the ancient settings where there surely were not clocks) and sometimes miles are mentioned too whearas most of the time the distances are in leagues.Overall the book is a unputdownable adventure which I found myself engrossed in until I finished the book. The story is terrific and the most interesting part is that after the book is over the reader just wants to grab the next volume which is sadly not available so far. The book presents terrific visuals for imagination and I am sure that even a person with least imagination can come up with pretty good visuals which one can remember after the book is over as if it would have been a great movie (thanks to LOTR series for their added visuals which can be utilised here perfectly). The story has many threads hanging loose which surely would be connected in the future volumes and thats the main cause for the much anticipated sequel. I rate it superb and would recommend the young and young adults to form their own views. The critics should understand that had this been the book written by someone like Mr. Ludlum (who baffles even the most advanced minds and which is generally meant for minds who can grasp complex plots) their strict reviews would have been more appropriate then."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Forced dialogue, Poor characterization, and almost no emotional pull renders an otherwise good story into meaningless drivel. The glaze on my eyes didn't clear until after page 150. (Enough time to blink!) It always saddens me when good money is spent on something that is seemingly all hype and no substance."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This book is, in short, Standard Adventure Quest Junk. A person wanders in the forest (And of course, he's the best hunter in the village). He finds a blue rock. &quot;It must be my destiny to have this!&quot; He cries.Then his family gets killed (How many times has this been done? A thousand times? More?), and he finds that his blue rock is an egg (gasp!). Then the storyteller (who would be much better left as an ordinary person) turns out to be a Dragon Rider, and travels with Eragon (That's one letter off from Aragon AND Dragon! What imagination!).Then they wander around rather aimlessly, and Eragon gets a magic sword, a fully grown dragon, and magic to blow things up with. (While we're giving him weapons, why not hand him a sword of Vorpal Slaying +12, and a Holy Hand Grenade?).Then, they kill some guy who's supposed to be evil, and rescue the elven princess (Cmon! That was the ultimate in cleashe!), and then they wander across a large desert. Then they come to some sort of city and slaughter a few baddies. Then they relize the evil guy they killed wasnt dead, so they kill him now.That's the storyline. I was not impressed. In this world, the evil king sits quietly on his throne and waits for some young loser to come and kill him. He has no powerful servents left (the author saw fit to kill them off before the story, leaving him with nameless wizards). And the politics in the world are perposterous. How does it work? If you're lucky enough to find a Dragon egg, then you instantly become a noble, and if you dont, then you are no more than a pesant, so get back to work.And you could see where a whole passage was effectively lifted out of Belgarath the Soceror! He barely changed the wording! It's about frustrating people until they get sick of it all and just yell some word at the impossible task they've been given to instantly learn magic. And when Eragon's summoning magic, it gives the impression that magic is just a tumor in his brain he lances to boil pus over people.So, in conclusion, Eragon was a poor first attempt at fantasy, bringing nothing new, and no interesting interations. It wouldnt have gotten published if his parents wern't working at the publishing company, and wouldn't have gotten any sales if the author didnt go around saying &quot;Buy my book!&quot; and spending more time getting magazines to generate hype then he did writing this 800 page monstrosity."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Eragon is what I would call an 'editor's dream'; meaning that there is practically nothing new in this book and it sounds as though the editor wrote it. This book is like a badly mixed recipe, with hints from all kinds of books and rolled together, bumpy and boring. It barely held my attention, and there is a very annoying fact that there is hardly any strong girl charactors.It starts out with a classic sound of King Arthur, and when you think about it, the history of Eragon's land is basically a copy of Camelot. The basic plot is incredibly predictable. The only characters that I liked were the dragon, Saphira, the healer Angela, and the elf Arya. I really did not care whether Eragon lived or died.About the only thing I liked about the writing was that he actually used some good adjectives, and even then it annoyed me that he used the word 'lanced' too much.I hope that he gets more skill as a writer in the next books, and doesn't rely on the editor so much. (Or sounds like he used the editor too much).In fact, the only reasons I will read the next book is to see how Saphira, Angela, and Arya fare, and to see the villainy of King Galbatorix. Please, PLEASE make Eldest better written than Eragon!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Well, if you are, don't choose this. Choose any of the books it's based off of.

It's decent, yes, but its certaintly nothing new. Honnestly, I'm impressed that parts of it even made it though editing.Anyway. If you're just looking for a book to waste time with, I'd suggest a series that is less traditional. If you're looking for good Fantasy, I'd suggest a series that's, well, good fantasy.

I didn't have to know in advance that a teenager wrote it. It shows. The writing style and the dialogue were abysmally adolescent. And the author seemed to have an aversion to the word \\"said.\\" As a writer myself, I believe that using terms besides \\"said\\" is acceptable, even needed, once in a while, but all the time? No!And the entire plot was a complete rip off from Star Wars with George Lucas's cast replaced by Tolkienesque characters.Eragon - Luke SkywalkerSaphiria - R2-D2 & C-3POMurtaugh - Han SoloBrom - Obi Wan KenobiArya - Princess LeiaKing Galbortix - Darth VaderYou get the idea.The logic of the characters and situations was glaringly flawed as well. Take Saphiria, for instance. I can suspend disbelief by accepting that she can grow so quickly with little food, but I cannot accept that she becomes so mature and wise at only a month old! It's as though she has decades, if not centuries of experience behind her already! And the telepathic communication between Eragon and Saphiria became tedious and annoying as the story went along. Another thing that annoyed me was when Brom tells Eragon that the weakest elf is better than the strongest human. That generalization reminded me of Hitler's ramblings about Aryan supremacy! What are the elves, Ubermenschen in Paolini's world?Nothing about this novel was original or creative. What the author did was steal the basic plot line from Star Wars and then fleshed it out with elements from all of the fantasy books he has ever read from The Lord of the Rings to The Dragonriders of Pern. It was as though the novel was arranged and prepared by a robot.The author clearly had himself in mind when he conceived of the main character for this \\"novel.\\" It is no coincidence that Eragon is the same age and gender as the author when he wrote it. But I suppose that is not surprising that he had developed such a fantasy life considering that he has been home schooled and lived in isolation since he was born. However, being cut off from the rest of the world has given him no opportunities to interact or develop lasting relationships with other people besides his immediate family members. Such an childhood has not prepared him with the maturity or the experience to write a sophisticated novel, even by the standards of a 15 year old. Nor will such an isolated lifestyle help him as a writer as he gets older.I will probably read the sequel: \\"Eldest\\" only to compare its plot elements with the Empire Strikes Back.King Galbortix: No! I am your father!Eragon: NNNNOOOOOOOO!!!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Christopher Paolini did write a book that copied the basics of Lord of the Rings, but it was a good book in its own right. I know as an author myself how hard it is to have completely inventive ideas, because as soon as I come up with one, it appears in the next Harry Potter book or Star Wars movie.However, there were some very obvious steals that never should have been made. One of my favorite lines in Tolkien's epic is \\"The time of the Elves has passed,\\" since it symbolizes so much about Middle Earth in this time period. I was astonished and very disappointed to see in Eragon the line \\"The Time of the Riders has passed.\\" Almost all of the characters can be matched up to one in Lord of the Rings, such as Brom as Gandalf (he speaks in riddles and blows smoke rings from a pipe). Also, Saphira can be the ring, since both sides are trying to get her on their side since she is so powerful.Many of the descriptions were very poetic, although there was definitely just a tad bit too many. Sometimes my brain wandered, although I believe Paolini realized this as I read an interview of his when he listened to the audio version of the book, and he said his jaw dropped when he realized how many details he included.I did enjoy the story, although it definitely followed a basic story plot line. Basically, this book is good to read but not to buy--borrow a copy from the library."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I had heard so many good things about this book in a reading group I'm in.

I don't really care about any of the characters or what happens to them, because I don't feel like I even know the characters. And this is after 250 pages.

I was really hoping this would be the amazing read all those zealots with a flame burning in their eye said it was.

If they haven't run across it yet, try to get them interested in a higher quality author's fantasy books for young people--think Harry Potter, A Series of Unfortunate Events, Alexander's Prydian books, etc. We can at least show our kids the road around the deceptively alluring swamps of non-talent that this book represents, even if we can't force them to avoid them completely."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This book is boring.

Eragon by Christopher Paolini exceeds all of the requirements! I like it because it has a very well described setting and Eragon, a poor farm boy, is very human. All of his emotions are very realistic and you really feel like he is a real person. I also like it because it is a very well written adventure, where the characters have feelings instead of jumping from one fight scene to the next. As Eragon, the main character, progresses throughout the adventure he becomes a different, better, person. You grow alongside him and experience everything with him.Eragon is an adventure with a very intricately laid plot, realistic characters, and much of the magic that so many readers crave. In the beginning Eragon finds a shiny rock that hatches into a dragon. To keep this dragon secret he teams up with the storyteller from the nearest town and runs away. From then on the two have many adventures while learning, fighting, and flying. Eragon goes to seek a resistance group in the Beor Mountains. They are resisting the rule of the evil king, whom will live almost forever and will stop at nothing to find and kill Eragon.Eragon is set in a area called Alagaesia. Dragons, Elves, Dwarves, and Humans are the main inhabitants of this far-off land. Eragon develops a strong sense of right and wrong and you will find yourself reading for hours on end.

For god's sake, he started writing the book when he was FIFTEEN. How many of you people have done that? I can honestly say that I started writing fantasy books (100 pages +) when I was ten. You don't have to believe it, but that's what was happening for me when I was ten. It's true that they were absolute crap and I never want to read them again. But at least I was WRITING.

Personally, I think it's AWESOME that Paolini started writing when he did. I also agree completely that yes, this book DOES steal multiple ideas from Lord of the Rings, Dragonriders of Pern, Star Wars, etc. But I say that it's better that Paolini got into the world of writing and publishing when he was seventeen or whatever, instead of thinking, \\"I'm a terrible writer, I should just suppress my creative energy and wait ten years.\\" Why did Eragon do so well? Because it's a light read with good imagery, and there are some parts that are quite well-written.

They rush hastily to critism and never take the time to appreciate the hard work that some put forth.\\"Books are the most quietest and most constant of friends; they are the most accessible and wisest of counselors; and the most patient of teachers.\\" ~Charles Eliot~Sheri"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Paolini has some storytelling merit, to be sure. Why else would his book be selling well? The plotline and characters are certainly interesting. But they're not interesting *enough*--I constantly found myself capable of reading a chapter, feeling more or less entertained, and then putting it down with absolutely no subconscious need to pick it up again. Whenever I did continue reading, I wasn't bored, but I also never felt the compulsion to finish. The story is too much of a cliche, and there is really nothing about Saphira or Eragon that seemed unique enough to pull them out of the stereotypical dragon or adolescent hero-kid of mass-produced fantasy novels. The writing itself was decent, but not great. But the book was also not so bad as to make me *not* recommend it to other viewers. In a nutshell, so-so."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I have to admit, this book is not that bad a read. It's very entertaining. However, there are certain elements of the book I need to point out.A fifteen-turning-sixteen year-old farm boy gets swept away by some life-changing event. It's been done for a very long time and Eragon is no exception. Frankly, I rather find it a bit boring. Also, the prophecy from the herbalist has a few obvious answers. Also, sailing away from the land at the end is purely borrowed from Lord of the Rings.Still, this book does make good use of these qualities. The plotline is quite impressive and the names are very creative. Not to mention the detail. It could paint a picture clearly in my head. I recommend this book to all fantasy lovers out there because, despite its flaws, it's a very impressive read."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This book is wonderful in its detail and depth of imagination. Lord of the Rings has always been my favorite trilogy and elven-type fantacy... but we shall see if the Inheritance series doesn't top it! Eragon stands alone as a fine read, but is only the introduction of characters for the adventures to come! Well done Christopher Paolini!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"It is a book of a Dragon Rider, finding a wierd stone that ends up to be a dragon egg! he ends to name the dragon Sphira.I sugest you to buy this book and read it! you'll love i could barely keep my eyes off it."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This is a wonderful coming-of-age story, set in a fantastical land. Paolini does a good job of skillfully weaving the tapestry together so that you care about the characters. It's a hard book to put down once you get started.As to another reviewer who graded the book poorly for being \\"derivative\\", I seriously doubt there are any wholly original tales out there. What makes any work unique are the characters and events and how they are arranged to make a whole. By that standard, Eragon *is* unique, and very enjoyable."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"For being a teen when he wrote Eragon, Christopher Paolini has potential. The only thing he lacks is imagination. I see so much Lord of the Rings in this book, from the bow-carrying elves to the names of cities.

It is very much like LOTR (Urgals/Orcs Elves/Elves/ etc...) but is pretty easy to read unlike LOTR, but it had themes in it that would be for teens and up (At least Eldest did). I think it is a good book for someone his age that had to learn to write, because I don't think he started out with a natural talent."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"When I finished reading this book I realized it would be one of the classics in the genre of fantasy.A young man, Eragon, lived with his uncle and cousin. He lived an average life until one day he went out for an average hunt. While he was climbing through a thicket of brush he found a peculiar looking egg. It was like nothing he had ever seen before. With its pristine color, and with Eragon's amazement he had no choice but to take it home. Later he discovered this was no ordinary egg, but one that contained a dragon, one of the last in his world. Tradgedy then strikes when his house is burnt down and his uncle is killed in the wreckage. Now he realizes that this dragon will help him bring justice to those who brutally destroyed his home and relative. Maybe Eragon was meant to find this egg in the forest. After reading what happens to this young man it may be true that this egg is fate."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"It was a fun book.

It is a wonderful book that is about a boy who finds a dragon egg in some woods. Before he knows it, he is thrust into a dizzy of events: the empire is hunting him down, evil forces pursue him, and he starts out on a journey with an old, suspicious man. It is a great book that contains, magic, magical creatures (elves, dwarves, etc.), and it also has swords and all that good stuff. Even though it is very much like Lord of the Rings, it is a great book."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I just finished Eragon, and I loved it so much, it was hard for me to put the book down.

But what 15 year old author doesn't want to replicate his favorite authors? The problems with this book are primarily in the worldbuilding aspect of the book. Yes, one sees Middle Earth; yes, one sees Star Wars; hell, I even found Norwegian myth, Beowulf, and George R. R. Martin.The type of reader that doesn't enjoy an archetypal hero story won't enjoy this book. It is a simple, linear plot, but in this context it is effective, as it is written and marketed as a children's book. And contrary to some opinions written here, there are definitely strong female characters with at least one who is given substance in this book and two more who I am certainly itching to hear more about.I read through this book quickly, the chapters are short which keeps the pace quick and exciting. It will make great bedtime reading for kids since there are plenty of stopping points.

Really I guess its cause I just like to read. There is no question that their are worse books and better books out there but on all accounts I found this book to be very enjoyable.However i do not believe that he really copied tolkien all that much. Besides the fact that the main character starts out on a journey, wait what fantasy novel doesn't start like that. Then again tell me what fantasy novel doesn't have at least one idea, which could be arguably traced back to tolkien. LolI personally thought it was entertaining."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"As a girl, I could not relate to any of the characters in this book. I like to be able to relate to at least one person. The female characters WERE all for him, him, him. Girls today know better, and stories that do this are intensely BORING to us. Mothers, if you give your daughters this book, you might as well tell them to forget about being a person in their own right. If they're beautiful and enjoy falling in love with adolescent boys for no particular reason, and then . . . BORING!! Oh poor me, I'm such a beautiful elf languishing in prison. Help me, help me.

I can't wait for the next book in the series."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Literature isn't chess, there are no young prodigies able to step in and change everything, because good writing only comes from life experience and years upon years of not only practice, but reading and understanding other peoples' work.It's been said \\"Good authors borrow; great authors steal,\\" but this is ridiculous. If Pupil A writes a paper for class, and Pupil B copies it verbatim but erases inane details and replaces them with his own names, what would the Professor do? Toss Pupil B out of class for cheating. While I've no doubt this young author has a passion and maybe even talent for writing, \\"Eragon\\" borders on plagarism and should not be rewarded for it. It is OK to learn from Tolkien, Jordan and Goodkind; it is NOT Ok to blatantly mirror them.The drive of this book isn't the book itself, but the gimmick that it was written by a teenager. That's disturbingly sad, and I hope intelligent readers of fantasy won't be fooled by this ploy. Meanwhile dozens of GREAT writers, whose aren't lucky enough to have parents who are publishers, aren't getting any recognition or deserved respect.This gimmick might get the kid a day on the Oprah show, but this book won't be remembered at all in 20 years. I don't mean him any ill will, but I hope he spends the coming years furthering his education, reading a wide variety of genres, and working on actual style and tone.

Focusing on the (Arguably) the most famous creature in the style, Eragon shows most of what Paolini may be capible of.

Somhow, things feel a little wierd in parts and some of the sentences were just SO ANNOYING. I still look forward to the next book and hope to see the same Tolkien-esque magic that made this a real winner.(Add one star if you enjoyed Tolkiens LOTR trilogy.

Capossere's review had some minor, almost-valid points, it couldn't be further from the truth. Of course, if you make your list of other authors and novels large enough, and you read into \\"Eragon\\" hard enough, you will be able to find examples of other works imbedded in \\"Eragon\\". However, these imbedded pieces are merely well-established facets of fantasy that Paolini abides by, just as Tolkien did decades ago, and authors have as well. \\"Eragon\\" is far from being full of predictable and boring plots, emotionless dialogue, and unrelenting clich&eacute;s. Having read all three of J.R.R Tolkien's \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" novels multiple times, I can honestly say I enjoyed \\"Eragon\\" much more. The story is written in an enjoyable style that doesn't require you to run for your dictionary every time an archaic word is uttered or bombastic language is unnecessarily used. It would seem that some of today's contemporary authors like to inflate their egos by injecting high-class vocabulary into their works when simpler terms would have sufficed; this is not so with Paolini's \\"Eragon\\". The story advances at a refreshing pace without lingering on any one aspect more then is necessary, and all key characters present in \\"Eragon\\" are properly fleshed out.

Now I am seventeen and it is difficult to find teen fiction books that will challenge me and not be boring. Paolini's books provide what I am looking for.Some dissatisfied customers have said in their reviews that Paolini has basically taken elements from other popular books and mixed them together, but I disagree. Some of these works may have influenced him, as happens with all authors, but he has made a work that is distinctly his own. These books transport me into a world like no other. They pull me in no matter how many times I read them. Most books I reread can be a bit irritating, because I wait impatiently for my favorite parts, but these keep me as entralled as the first time I read them.It may seem like a small thing, but I love the names of characters, places, objects. Not many authors are gifted with the ability to come up with fitting and unique names.I find the plot to be unpredictable, and the characters individual and complex, traits that are not often found in traditional fantasy quest books. The politics are fitting and layerd, the different points of view (in the times that the story is told by someone else) unique.The different races (elves, dwarves, dragons etc.) are just traditional enough that I don't feel like Paolini's trying to make a statement, but with twists and traits that make them not seem human--which is the point.This is a wonderful series, and I would recommend it to any reader.Other good books I have found recently (or not so recently) that you might find interesting: The Hunger Games (Suzanne Collins), Graceling (Kristin Cashore), Artemis Fowl (Eoin Colfer), The Golden Compass (Philip Pullman)."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I love this book.

Amazing written."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I've never taken the time to write a review, but this book was a real disappointment. This is a weak \\"Lord of the Rings\\" rip-off.The writing is like being hit over the head repeatedly... no subtlety. The character development is roughly, \\"Eragon realized he wasn't a farm boy, but a mighty dragon rider with a responsibility to all the little children.\\" Or, \\"Eragon felt really, really bad that his mentor died.\\"Paolini is so wrapped up in writing an epic that he forgets, or is unable, to make his characters real. They're one-dimensional and weak.Paolini seems to hope the plot can drive the book, supported by the details of the world he's \\"creating.\\" The problem is that he's not creating anything, just stealing from the Lord of the Rings. His world of humans, elfs, and dwarfs is a weak contrast to the Rings series and other books.What drove me over the edge to write this is that Paolini is arrogant enough to write this as a multi-part series. The ending is lame, with a big voice that says, \\"Come find me....\\" It's amazing that he expects this book would draw us back.Bottom line: don't waste your money on this one."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I first heard of this book while watching the Today show. The promising interview (and Mr. Paolini's terrific artwork) convinced me that I had to read this book. So I was thrilled when my husband surprised me with a copy.Sadly, I soon realized that ERAGON (which had been described as \\"better than Harry Potter\\" by a young reader referred to in the interview) was nothing more than a cobbling together of stories by more talented writers. How I can justify the incongruity between the praise in the interview and my poor reading experience? Perhaps this book would be pleasing to someone who's time spent with the fantasy genre consisted of the Harry Potter stories excusively. But for anyone who's come within ten yards of David Edding's BELGARIAD series, or Anne McCaffry's DRAGONRIDER series, or a dozen other well-known stories, ERAGON is a sad and frustrating copy.For an intelligent tale of magic and self-discovery, start with Edding's PAWN OF PROPHECY. His characters are compelling and three-dimensional. The occasional humor is a delightful counterbalance to the action. Unlike Eragon and his companions, you actually care what happens to young Garion and company.If the concept of dragonriders is appealing to you, check out McCaffry's DRAGONFLIGHT. Here you get fully-fleshed dragon-dragonrider relationships, not to mention a complex, believable social structure.Besides Paolini's obvious borrowing from these and other authors, I found the extensive list of made-up words highly annoying. With few exceptions, they were poorly crafted, unnatural-sounding, and failed to add interest to the story. If only Paolini had read Vonda McIntyre's \\"Pitfalls of Writing SF and Fantasy\\" (see her website), particularly \\"Pitfall #7: Neologisms, or, Calling a Rabbit a Smeerp, or, This Essay Almost Made My Spell-Checker Toss Its Cookies\\". To paraphrase Ms. McIntyre, unless you have a particular talent for inventing words, made-up words sound made-up.Despite the effort it took to finish this book, I wish Mr. Paolini well. With more experience and original ideas, this young writer has the potential to create an enjoyable story."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Eragon belongs in the category of fan fiction. No wonder reviewers are dazzled: so many fantastic events and wonderful ideas in one book. Tne only problem is that the events and ideas come from other authors. Christopher Paolini has systematically raided great fantasy writers, pilfering their ideas right and left, right down to the names he gives places and characters (though sometimes he changes a couple of letters). If you don't believe me, read Anne McCaffrey's DRAGONRIDERS OF PERN, Robert Jordan's EYE OF THE WORLD, and JRR Tolkien's LORD OF THE RINGS. The so-called professional critics who have given this book the nod should be ashamed. If they bothered to educate themselves about the fantasy genre, they'd recant the glowing praise they've given this book and bestow it on the ones who actually deserve it--the authors I've mentioned. This book has a beautiful cover, but what's inside is cheap imitation. Christopher Paolini may be excused due to his youth, but if he's intelligent enough to assemble such a long piece of fan fiction, presumably he can grasp the concept of stealing."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"...The prose is an unholy mish-mesh of melodramatic simple sentences. A perfect example:\\"Wind howled through the night, carrying a scent that would change the world. A tall Shade lifted his head and sniffed the air. He looked human except for his crimson hair and maroon eyes.He blinked in surprise. The message had been correct: they were here. Or was it a trap? He weighed the odds, then said icily, \\"Spread out; hide behind trees and bushes. Stop whoever is coming . . . or die.\\"The story telling doesn't involve characterization, so much as the descriptive details you might expect to find on a Dungeons and Dragons character sheet. It seems that in some sectors \\"young adult\\" writing is simply synonymous with bad writing, but I must stress that this simply isn't so. Examples from my childhood - such as Madeleine L'Engle or Ursula K. Le Guin, or even contemporary writers - The Spiderwick Chronicles (with DiTerlizzi's excellent illustrations) and Lemony Snicket's Series of Unfortunate Events come to mind as contemporary examples of creative fantastical story telling.The plot is hackneyed and clich&eacute;d. Readers are unlikely to come out of the experience with a single thing that couldn't be taken from the typical fantasy series of the past fifty years, be it McAffrey's works or the Dragonlance Chronicles.Don't let the publicity fool you. This book is certifiably awful. Like Subway's Jared, it's an example that our society is leaning towards the celebration of individuals who try harder at selling themselves than at accomplishing something worthwhile. I've worked with young writers for a while as something of an instructor and mentor, aiding them in improving their work and reaching their target audience, and the vast majority of them have produced writing far better than this. I find it incomprehensible that people can welcome something that isn't even up to par with other works by those of the same age. This lacking falls well short of even Jordan and Goodkind, who I consider terrible enough.Don't waste your time. ..."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I'm not sure what fantasy/science fiction epic was not ripped off by the young Paolini to fuel his insipid young boy meets dragon story...but in the end it matters little.No matter how many great works one rips off, if the author has no unifying vision of their own, if they have nothing to say, then their book will be a mess.Eragon, and it's equally uninspired sequels are exactly that."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Paolini is painted as a prodigy, and he very well may be. His book actually isn't half bad. His editor, however, should be fired.I started reading it in an airport, but found it hard to concentrate on the similar words/names Paolini uses. On the plane, I used the glossary to refine my understanding of the words used.Now, I am a fan of Tolkien just like the rest of the world, but I found it rather patronizing that the hero, on a quest for personal growth and self-discovery, is named so closely to Tolkien's Aragorn. That's just the most superficial example of Paolini's mimicry.Paolini's age clearly shows in the underdeveloped dialogue that his characters engage in. Eragon's cousin is supposedly in a heated love affair with the daughter of the town's butcher, but their conversation is so dispassionate that it might as well have been a clinical analysis of romance.These shortfalls could have been cured by a competent, attentive editor. Rather, it appears that the editor simply allowed Paolini's valiant, yet underdeveloped work go to press without the detailed review it deserved.Paolini may be a gifted author for his age, but his work certainly does not earn some of the accolades it has been accorded. I, for one, will look for more from him once he matures as an individual and as an author."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Okay, I admit it, the cover art drew me in. Unfortunately, the writing quickly threw me right back out. This book's editor should be simultaneously disbarred and pelted with marshmallows. Wow! This book is a real stinker."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This book has gotten lots of attention since it first came out, partly because the author is so young. He was fifteen when he started the book, and was nineteen when it was published. I do not generally like to judge based on age, especially since I am a young writer myself, but when I read this book, I could TELL that the writer was either young or an immature writer. The book was published by the author's parents' publishing company, and only later sent to Knopf by a published writer whose kid had picked it up at one of the family's self-funded book signings and liked it. Then the book was re-edited and repackaged and re-released under that label. I believe that if this book had meandered its way to publishing houses the usual way, it would have been rejected as unpublishable, for reasons I will discuss in depth here.Christopher Paolini himself, in his own words, describes his story thus: \\"Eragon is an archetypal hero story, filled with exciting action, dangerous villains, and fantastic locations. There are dragons and elves, sword fights and unexpected revelations, and of course, a beautiful maiden who's more than capable of taking care of herself.\\"I would argue that this book is not an \\"archetypal hero story\\" so much as an overused and overly traditional Tolkienien \\"epic,\\" with \\"epic\\" in quotes because it lacks exactly that epic nature that made the world of Lord of the Rings so rich. There was absolutely nothing new or \\"unexpected\\" in this book (though the author claims there are \\"revelations\\"), and if a reader is excited by this book it is because he or she has never been exposed to the dozens of fantasy and science fiction epics from which this author pulled his influences. My feeling was that this book was nothing special because, if I may be so blunt, \\"it's been done,\\" and it's been done better.Though I have to give the single prop that by standards of TECHNICAL editing it was a smooth novel (I, a professional editor, did not notice a single typographical error), I must say that content-wise it was an editorial mess. The fact that this novel breaks about a billion rules of thumb in the writing industry raises my suspicions that it was not edited by a very discerning eye.My complaints regarding the writing style itself:Every imaginable permutation of the word \\"said\\" is used. If the reader cannot tell how someone is saying something by what they are saying, it is likely that the dialogue has been written sloppily. \\"'You're not thinking,' admonished Brom.\\" Yes, that is an admonishment without you telling us so. Leave it out. \\"'Get on with the story,' he said impatiently.\\" Well, if one person is urging another to get on with it, it stands to reason that it's being said impatiently. Running into \\"'Sorry,' apologized Brom\\" made me cringe. The fact that Brom said \\"Sorry\\" means that he apologized, so use \\"said.\\" You can deviate from \\"said\\" if for some reason HOW the sentence is said is not obvious, such as volume (\\"he whispered\\") or intent (\\"he said sarcastically,\\" if it isn't obvious that that's a sarcastic comment anyway). Leave out the decorations because they're tacky.Unnecessary description is inserted with maddening frequency. I am not usually a reader of traditional fantasy, and traditional fantasy does tend to be more flowery than the hard stuff, but either way random descriptions should not just be thrown into the mix. Eragon is waking up and stretching. Suddenly we get a description of the items on his night table, including the random information that he likes to look at one of the objects on it frequently. In the meantime, while we are getting this rush of information, Eragon is putting on his shoes. He then does not proceed to touch, pick up, or look at anything on the night table, and none of it is ever mentioned again. Also, people and places just get sudden paragraphs of description. We're fighting an Urgal and all of a sudden . . . drop some description on us. While he's rushing at Eragon with drooling fangs, no less. By all means, describe the fangs, slipping the adjectives in gracefully. But don't give us a run-down of a typical Urgal when we're a lot more interested in whether those fangs are going into Eragon's head.And lastly, too many words, phrases, and concepts seem to be entirely lifted from other well-known works. Word choice seemed as though it was the author's attempt to use all his SAT words; it was verbose and flowery as if on purpose, trying to impress with vocabulary that would have been better used sparingly. The similarity of some people's and places' names to those of Tolkien have not gone unnoticed by seasoned fantasy readers; I have heard several people call this book \\"Aragorn\\" without even noticing that they weren't saying it right, not to mention things like Ardwen (compared with Arwen), Isenstar (compared with Isengard), and Isidar (compared with Isildur)--and there are a LOT more. Far too often, ridiculously overused or clich&eacute;d similes and metaphors are used, such as tears being described as \\"liquid diamonds.\\" It is less like this book was written and more like it was sewn together from the torn apart products of others, like some old quilt on which the stitches are showing. (How's that for an original simile?)And now, criticism regarding the content:Goofy made-up language. I think there is little actual consistency in the languages, though Paolini tries to explain that away by saying the land was settled by different people with different languages. (Seems to me an excuse for lack of consistency.) Actually, the randomness of the accents and umlauts really came off as an attempt to make the language look cool and foreign. Yes, you have succeeded in making it all exotic. I guess that was the point? And yes, I know that these words were based upon real ancient and modern languages which many readers would consider \\"unpronounceable,\\" but that's no excuse for the overall inconsistency; Tolkien's languages were hard to figure out, but he was a linguist, and there WAS rhyme and reason. You have to make all kinds of new language rules up to make \\"Alagasia\\" actually be pronounced the way he says it is, and it just would have been easier to spell it in a more intuitive way. It is not as if he is failing to be true to a well-thought-out phonics system if he excludes the delicious foreign-looking characters.Helpfully (of course), Paolini has included for us pronunciation guides and dictionaries in the appendices, though he warns us in said appendices that he is not translating Eragon's magic utterances word for word in order--and I quote--\\"to save the reader from Eragon's atrocious grammar.\\" (In other words, we are supposed to believe that he, like Tolkien, created entire other languages for these books, but since these \\"languages\\" are unlikely to hold up to intense scrutiny by any linguist--if any linguist could be made to care--there is the excuse that Eragon doesn't really speak it right.)And speaking of Tolkien. . . .Okay. Attractive, complex map on inside cover. Flowery language, often to the point of ridiculousness (such as \\"when he would return, he knew not\\"). Elves are fair, beautiful, long-lived people with another language. Dwarves are short, stocky, bearded people who wear chain mail and use axes. Dragons breathe fire. Creatures called Urgals are fairly uncomfortable with the sun and speak a guttural language, though there are the \\"elite\\" forms of these which don't seem to mind the sun and have multiple times the strength and endurance. All swords seem to have names. Hmm, except for the fact that the name \\"Urgal\\" is used and people can actually ride the dragons, I think this might just be Middle-Earth. I kept expecting to see a hobbit.On the same note, it seems the author felt compelled to cover nearly every fantasy-epic plotline known to man, and kept kind of changing his mind about what focus to use. There's the coming-of-age hero myth thing going on, but there's also the mythological creature bonding, the war and rivalry between different fictional races, and of course the saving of a maiden and the defeat of a villain. (A minor one, of course--it's a trilogy, so the main bad guy gets to live for a while longer.)Additionally, the story contains many details that might have been included in the interest of fleshing out the world of Alagasia, but they were rather pointless meanderings rather than descriptions that mattered later and added to the richness of the novel. I got the idea that the author just wanted to tell us some neat detail he'd worked out, one of those things that authors are supposed to KNOW but not tell the audience unless it MATTERS, and in order to squeeze it in he just randomly has the main character have these questions occur to him so that someone else can go off on a tangent explaining the finer points of, say, the communication system they use in this half-deserted mountain. Sometimes it just seems he hasn't quite figured out what inventive little blurbs should nevertheless be left out.Pet peeve: At least three or four times in this novel it is mentioned that someone \\"cries a single tear\\" or has a \\"single tear\\" running down his or her face. Why does it always have to be one tear? This is not the movies, you can have torrential crying in a book if you want to. This does not strike me as romantic. This strikes me as obviously fake and contrived, not true emotion but more to write a cool visual scene. I am really turned off by this.Overall, I just think that this book was written as though it had a template or blueprint for \\"traditional fantasy novel\\" and the details and names were simply filled in. I couldn't help feeling the entire time I was reading it that I had read this story before, nothing was much of a surprise, and things that didn't make sense or got in the way of a conflicting original vision were smoothed over with excuses or deliberate muddling of motives. I think that in order to write something so traditional, a writer needs something special, a unique twist or slant, and this just hasn't got it. (In other words, I'm not saying that writing an \\"archetypal fantasy epic\\" is BAD; I'm saying that it needs to not be a rehashing of overused themes that were INVENTED--not derived from mythology or legend, but INVENTED--by classic writers.) I can't pick out a single thing that this book has that has never been done before, the characters didn't interest or capture me, the storytelling was riddled with too many attempts to be grand that I was just entirely turned off by it.Inspiration is one thing but literary transplants are another thing entirely. And any good surgeon knows that if you're going to do a transplant then there has to be a blood type match. From the lethal curdling that I saw in Eragon, I'd venture to say that Middle-Earth is O-positive and Alagasia is AB. Negative."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I'm currently twelve years old, and after three years of hearing all the hype surrounding Eragon and its successor (Eldest), I decided to give it a try and see if it really lived up to all the praise. I was very disappointed.Summary: I'm sure that you've already read this in all the other reviews so I'm just going to outline the most basic and important things. Our main character here is a fifteen year old poor farm boy called Eragon, who one day just happens to find a dragon egg. From this egg hatches our other main character, Saphira the dragon. With the help of a few allies, Eragon and Saphira basically travel through the Empire where this story takes place in search of truth and vengeance for what happens to Eragons uncle.The Bad: The main problem that I have with Eragon is that it's missing one of the essential ingredients that truly make a good book. Hm, let's see, now what's that word I'm looking for,ah................. Oh yeah! It's called ORIGINALITY! Christopher Paolini should be arrested. This book is basically Lord of the Rings with the plot of Star Wars. Once you get around to the fourth chapter or so one can easily predict what the rest of the book is going to be like. And there lies another problem,IT'S TO PREDICTABLE! All you have to do is change the setting, give them a couple of light sabers, take away the dragon, and you have the perfect clone of Episode IV A New Hope.The Good: I can't write a review and do nothing but slam a book. That's just not fair. Despite my extreme outrage for the lack of originality, I have to admit that this has had me locked up in my room all Thanksgiving break. Even though I had a strong sense of what was going to happen, I found that I couldn't put it down. I don't know, but no matter how much you may hate it, there's something about Eragon that just won't let you put it down. Christopher Paolini really is a good author (fantastic considering how old he was when he wrote it) and if in the future he decides to break out of the mold, I truly think he's very capable of writing a book worth so much praise.Over all I chose to give this book three stars because like I mentioned earlier, it certainly does its job of entertaining and letting one escape into another world ( even if you feel like you've already been there a hundred times in other stories). So in short, read it, but don't expect anything new or \\"epic\\"."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Okay, so Christopher Paolini turned his thesaurus upside down and shook out a few different words, but, for all of his rearranging, he couldn't cover the fact that this book is completely unoriginal.

If you have read only the major works of fantasy, read or seen \\"Lord Of The Rings\\", or have even a vague remembrance of the plotline of the \\"Star Wars\\" movies, then take heart, for you can say with all honesty that you have read \\"Eragon\\".It's no excuse that the author is just 19.

There are a great number of masterpieces, but does it mean they all are our types? Each reader has their own world. Dragons and magic always interest me. That's why I chose Eragon and Eldest. A young boy who just knows his own village is forced to face the outside world with an old wise man. In his journey, he has to make many choices. Sometimes hard, sometimes easy. But he can not predict what would happen even after he makes some decisions. The world is precarious. But he has a good partner, an ancient dragon, who talks to him in mind. She helps him quite a lot. Just like this world, we meet many different people. So does Eragon.

Author Christopher Paolini captures the wonderful essence of fantasy, putting on paper what others only dream of. Paolini creates a world full of such wonders that the end will leave readers wishing for the next installment.I have to admit that when I first picked up Eragon and read the prologue, I thought it would be a waste of time. The first few pages were filled with elves, magic, and death, and I felt that I was about to read a book by a Tolkien copycat. And I was right, in a sense. Throughout the book I saw various connections between Christopher Paolini's world and J.R.R. Tolkien's world: Urgals to Orcs, Isenstar to Isengard, Orthiad to Orthanc, and the list goes on.But then I realized Paolini didn't copy Tolkien's work; he simply branched off it. I also came to realize that many other authors have branched off Tolkien's work. Any Harry Potter fan will notice that those books contain many parallels to J.R.R Tolkien's books. And so I must apologize to Paolini for judging his book by its cover (or rather, its first few pages). After I realized this, I immediately started over. It wouldn't be fair to the author to say that this novel is just a ripoff of the Lord of the Rings.Eragon is the first book in the Inheritance trilogy. When a boy named Eragon comes to possess a polished blue stone in the forest known as the Spine, he thinks he has found something of great value. He hopes it might buy his family meat for the coming winter. Imagine his great surprise when a dragon hatches from it. Soon, Eragon realizes that he is now mixed up in a great battle that has lasted for hundreds, if not thousands, of years. With the help of his good friend Brom and the dragon Saphira, Eragon sets out on a journey to become a member of the greatest and noblest force that has ever existed - the Dragon Riders.When I finished the book, I knew right away that it would be a best seller. Young Christopher has a wonderful gift for spreading his love of fantasy to all. With battles between good and evil and friendships tested and challenged, Eragon should be recognized as one of the greatest pieces of fantasy literatureCopyright 2003 BlueJeanOnline.com"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This book was the most thrilling fantasy book I have ever read.

He has opened his own new world from which to develop sagas and epics for years to come. It should be interesting to watch this young man develop as an author. It's nice to see quite a bit of originality as well."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"There are two ways to read and judge this book. One is to see it as a new fantasy novel; the other is to see it as a new fantasy novel written by someone so young. I must admit it is quite enjoyable. It is not written badly or immaturely at all despite the fact that the author was only 15 years old when he wrote it. If you are a fan of fantasy books, this one is definitely good for ages 10 and up with a good choice of words used that suits children, teenagers and adults. Fantasy writing is a tricky business; some authors slap on a thin coat of backdrop for their characters to parade against, and others lay on detail after excruciating detail. Paolini strikes a happy medium, showing wisdom beyond his years. He gives his world and his characters depth and reality.Most parts of the book, including the beginning are very mysterious. I am not surprised if some people will loose themselves in the midst of all the names to remember, languages and the rather complicated and confusing story plotline. It is quite difficult to follow the story at first. This might annoy some people. But despite this fact, this will keep most readers at the edge of their seats, waiting excitedly to find out what happens next.In terms of character development, there were \\"bumps\\" that Paolini should have \\"smoothed out\\". For Eragon, it was not bad like Saphira's. They showed how he improved in fighting skills, education and talent. However, in Saphira's case, Paolini did not really show the bond between her and Eragon growing. I had expected to see it grow rather than it just being there from the start. Moreover, some characters did not really have a unique personality that differentiates them from the other characters. For example, Eragon behaved nothing like a 15 year old person I expected him to be. Some chapters he was arrogant, others, humble, and sometimes, even lame. At times he seemed nothing more than a boy. Within minutes he was an braver and \\"stronger\\" than an experienced warrior.The old man Brom was an enigma; he serves as Eragon's guide and teacher, and there's more to him than meets the eye. He was also supposed to be patient, but sometimes, he just looses his temper or get very impatient with Eragon when teaching him. The dragon Saphira, is alright though, she is a sentient creature equipped with both intellect and instinct. She and Eragon bond mentally. She was wise all the way. However, I find it hard to believe that she could be much wiser than any other characters when she was likely the youngest of them all. There is a slight irony there. I also find it hard to believe that Saphira's affection and love was already there for Eragon soon after he found her. I will prefer it if Paolini had shown how their relationship develops rather than it just being there already.The story plot is highly engrossing. It is about a bad king versus outnumbered good rebels. It is mainly about a young innocent boy forced into an adventure and turning into some kind of hero. Though this has been used many times in various stories, and though it is kind of clich&eacute;d, it is highly entertaining as well. Paolini definitely has a talent in making used stories interesting again. He certainly shows himself skilled at adaptation and improvisation, building a good read out of old materials. Furthermore, every chapter in this book is intelligently written, without even the slightest hint of monotony. There were some parts of the story, along with some characters, that does not come into the story until the later parts. This then makes the reader understand the story better and look forward to more.Yet, setting aside the great story plot, I cannot help but feel slightly annoyed at the fact that Paolini's creation of creatures and story plot was not that original at all. Truthfully, I cannot think of one single thing that Paolini had created that was original. Sure, there are creatures known as the 'Urgals' in the book. But I feel it was somewhat very similar to the 'Orcs' in Tolkein's books. Same with the 'Ra'zacs', this is very similar to Tolkien's \\"nine Nazgul\\". I also caught a lot of similarities to Lord Of The Rings, Harry Potter, Star Wars, The Matrix, and The Dragonriders of Pern series. I guess it is either Paolini's got most of his ideas from them, or that I am over analysing the book. In this case, I find that people should not analyse this book at all. Then they will most definitely get absorbed in the fantasy and enjoy reading it throughout.The only problem I found with Paolini's writing style is that his descriptions were sometimes too much. Like the description of the environment of the character is more than the character himself. Although He described what the things sounded like as though you were there at that same exact time and place, I found it to be unnecessary as it will distract from whatever flow, the story has. Plus, it makes the book long winded, beating about in the bush, instead of being straightforward on how the story goes. This is the reason why I find some parts of the book boring. Paolini pays attention to small details in his book, like an artist would as he paints his greatest masterpiece. In my opinion, Paoilini has conquered a feat that most young adults only dream of.Overall, I find Eragon pretty good. It kept me going, entertained, until the very last page of the book. Paolini has definitely created a world full of magic, fantasy and an adventure that readers like me can get absorbed into. You get a real sense of involvement while reading this book; the author has done a good job of making the world feel real. He also does well setting up plot points to be continued and resolved in the remaining books.I am looking forward to his second book called Eldest. Not only because I want to find out the continuation of the great story plot, but also because I want to see if his writing style has matured, more developed and improved. I wish Paolini good luck, he definitely has potential."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This book is great the characters are dynamic and change and mature throughtout the book. Its so good i laughed and cried when the characters did and when it ended I nearly cried it was so good. Eragon loses alot but hes strong enough to know when to cry and when to stand up a fight. If your a fantasy fan like me youll wanna pick this book up. =^_^="},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I give this book four of five stars only because it is a first novel, and one should never achieve the epitome of success with one's first attempt. Writing the next one would be too intimidating if the first one were considered perfect. (How would you ever live up to it?)Having read the other reviews, and having read the book itself twice and listened to it twice on tape, I feel the need to add my voice to the others: it was enchanting. I have been reading (and writing) fantasy since I was ten. (Almost forty years ago.) I have read all of the books other reviewers have pointed to as either things young Christopher has paid homage to or things that he has pilfered from. I am on the homage side of the fence.Yes, there are similar elements to the Belgariad--but I find this book to be more absorbing than the Belgariad, which I found a little awkward in phrasing, and even more awkward in plotting. While reading the Belgariad, which I did enjoy, mind you, it was very difficult for me to \\"suspend my disbelief\\" at some points. I did not have this trouble while reading Eragon. Yes, it has a similarity to Anne McCaffrey's Dragon Riders of Pern series, especially regarding the dragon/rider connection and the basic nature of dragons. However, it is different enough that I don't feel oppressed by it. LOTR, with the elven and dwarvish background--yeah, it's similar. But if you read any Irish mythology of the Sidhe, you will find this background has been common knowledge for beau-coup years. Centuries, even.To those who are fixated on these things, I say, \\"Carp, carp, carp. You are missing the point.\\" We have a very talented young author on the rise here. Though the plot was somewhat standard, the characters were original, intriguing, and likeable. I like the fact that Eragon does stupid things, falls on his face, and gets knocked on the head occasionally. He's a kid. That's how kids learn. One good knock on the head is more educational than a hundred lectures. I can identify with a hero who falls on his face because I have fallen on mine more times than I care to remember in my many years of life. The irascible Brom as the mentor was also great. He was flawed and perhaps even cursed, yet good and unwilling to give up the battle even when it seemed hopeless.The character of Saphira has much more depth and personality to me than the dragons of Pern. She is an individual. Most of Pern's dragons are basically the same. A queen is a queen is a queen. Likewise with the bronzes and the blues and the greens. (Don't misunderstand me; I'm not putting down Pern. I love Pern. I would emigrate to Pern if I could get a visa.)Murtaugh is my favorite character. What a lonely, tortured soul he is! I am very eager to find out if my personal auguries regarding his identity and relationship with certain other characters are accurate.My final comment on this story is this: If Christopher Paolini is this good now, what amazing things we can expect from him later, as his craft grows! He also is a kid, so if you must knock him on the head, he will learn from it. In fact, as he rereads his work, I suspect he will knock himself on the head a few times in frustration that he didn't see or realize certain things before he published. It is a joy to see how his keen mind has shaped his story. That same keeness will enable him to learn and grow from this experience.Christopher, you go, young one!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Stupid, moronic, idiotic. I'm twelve.

For the next few months, I searched everywhere for it, but was disappointed.Recently, however, a friend mentioned this \\"dragon book\\" by a fifteen year old. My response was, \\"Eragon?\\" That was how I found out where to get the book.I read it in two days, and was drawn in by every sentence. To be fair, there were some instances which I thought stilted, for example, when Solembum informs Eragon about what to do if his power is insufficient, etc. It sounded too much like my own writing.And yet it fit, and I definitely could not write it any better. Some descriptions have been said to be clich&eacute;s, and yet, in the context of the book, they fit. Sure, he could do better, but where would Paolini go if he wrote his best book at fifteen?The languages are interesting, although more of them would always be nice for those of us who are amateur linguists. The few sentences aren't enough to have a grammatical review. But more will surely be coming in Eldest, book two.Why is Eragon so popular, and so hated? I have read articles by people who find itrepulsive, who need to read all the Harry Potter books to cleanse their minds before sleeping, and I also have my own reaction which was to redesign my list of best authors from JRR Tolkien, Asimov, and Jacques to JRR Tolkien, Paolini, Asimov, and Jacques.This is proof that it is like the LotR, as JRRT observed peoples reactions to it in a poem: The Lord of the Rings/is one of those things/if you like it you do/if you don't then you boo!Congratulations to Christopher Paolini for a great book, and I, for one, have no need to cleanse my mind after reading \\"Eragon.\\" (Which is not something I could say about some other writers. . .)"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"From the moment I started reading this book I literally COULD NOT set it down.

Two nights in a row I was up far past 3am reading, only to get up and read in my classes. Yes, this book is THAT GOOD!When looking back, this story does not have any details that stand out among any other fantasy books. It actually seems to incorporate many of the stories I have read into one story. While I am sure this was unintentional, it does leave me thinking, \\"Have I read that somewhere before?\\"The story is about a boy named Eragon, who becomes the first Rider in centuries. A Rider is a man who has bound himself mentally with a dragon. All of the Riders have been killed off by the current King, who himself is a Rider, albeit an evil one. Riders live unusually long lives, so it seems that this evil king's reign will never end.Eragon's adventure takes him from his small shire-like home to large cities and into the depths of mountains. He runs into people who will lie, cheat, steal, and deceive to get what they want. All the while he meets people who would give their life for what they believe in. Along his way he meets elves, dwarfs, and humans who have not seen the outside world for centuries.Christopher Paolini's first novel is absolutely FANTASTIC!

Once you pick this book up, you can't put it down.

I am sure I would have finished in a day if it hadn't been for school.I would absolutely encourage spending the money to buy this book.

It's the best book I've ever read--better than Tokien.Paolini has very imaginative names in the book and there is plenty of action. The action is more graphic than Tolkien's but not too graphic. Here is an example: \\"Shaking off the pain, he cleaved open an Urgal's skull, mixing brains with metal and bone.\\"The book Eragon takes place in a time before guns and in a time where some characters have magical powers.

I don't fault the author. I think it is remarkable that a 16 year old had the self-discipline to write a 500 page novel. However, I can't understand why a publisher would have printed it.If the book were simply derivative, I could have, perhaps, forgiven the publisher. But the book is poorly written as well. The style is awkward. The punctuation is poor. The characters are cardboard figures with the emotional depth of...well, a 16 year old.I don't buy into the excuse that \\"Eragon\\" was intended for young readers and not for a more critical adult audience. If anything, standards should be higher for children's literature. Every book is a learning experience for a child, and the children reading this book are going to learn that it is alright to place your commas is odd places. They are going to learn that it is acceptable to \\"borrow\\" your story from other writers. \\"Charlotte's Web\\" is a good children's book. \\"Eragon\\" is a step below comic books as appropriate reading material for children.So...the author is young and inexperienced. The publisher probably saw dollar signs when presented with an opportunity to sell a slightly repackaged version of Star Wars-Tolkien-MaCaffrey. But where was the editor? Surely, there must have been an editor who could have coached Paolini through some of the more obvious flaws in the book.In summary, the author should be congratulated for his industry.

As stated in other reviews, it was derivative and clich&eacute;. It had all of the same elements as every other bland fantasy book, along with the extra baggage of a teen-aged writer trying to flex underdeveloped vocabulary muscle--one gets the feeling that Paolini wrote the book with his high school vocabulary lists on one side, a dictionary on the other, and classic fantasy books in his lap. The dialogue was stilted and unnatural, and the reader finds it hard to care about any of the characters because they're not well developed. One of the review blurbs on the dustjacket's back calls Eragon a \\"precocious debut.\\" I think that's true; but Paolini's quite aware that he's out of his league, and tries to compensate for his uninspired vision by using big words as well as stereotypic characters and generic action sequences. Unless Fox makes some drastic changes in dialogue and character development in its upcoming film adaptation, the movie will flop due to poor critical reviews and snickering, exhasperated audiences. Hopefully the rest of the planned trilogy will improve the story and make \\"Inheritance\\" worth the readers' time and money."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I have heard of good things about this book, but not all are good and my review is not a thumbs up. This book was copied from parts of The Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter. Names such as Orcs and Urgals are used that are too closely related to other villain names in LOTR. Magic was used that seemed to be a lot like of Harry Potter. Also the title of this book (Eragon) is almost exactly the same as a name (Aragorn) in The Lord of the Rings I think those two names are just too much alike. Cultures such as Elves and Dwarves are also used too. I think Paolini should have used different cultures than those. Overall this is not a great book. It certainly will NEVER be even as good as Harry Potter or certainly The Lord of the Rings"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"The essence of Eragon's failure is its lack of earnestness. What Paolini has done is simply a failed amalgation of adolescent, prepubescent tales that caught his fancy. His depictions of women are ethereal, full of boyish longing. His plot flits hither and thither, from one iconic fantasy tale to another. But what is worst, beyond the sheer silliness of its subject matter and the workmanlike quality of its prose, is the mediocrity in which his subject matter is immersed. Like an adolescent preening for profundity, he simply lays naked a frightening lack of talent, and disregard for the innards of what gives true writing DEPTH. This tale skims surfaces, never plumbs the real depths of its protagonists, makes its antagonists caricatures rather than characters. A painful work to read. Adults and those of discerning intelligence--let the children read this, and have their day. Maturity awaits them down the road."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Maybe it's me, but I think the fact that I'm repeatedly told that this novel was written by a fifteen year old is some kind strategic sales tactic by the publishers. I mean, knowing that the author is a minor already has us inclined to think that this novel will be nothing short of spectacular. If he's only fifteen, than this had better be a darn good book for it to be published! Of course, like most assumptions, that turned out to be wrong.What's wrong with this book? Aside from technical aspects, like awkward sentencing and poor editing, the real problem with this novel is that its author seems too focused on copying other, better writers. Paolini seems very keen on pulling off a Tolkien-esque story with a Tolkien-esque narrative, which makes this entire book (pretty though the packaging may be) seem awfully amateurish.I strongly discourage the continuation of this series, because it's extremely derivative. I suggest The Lord of the Rings trilogy (though weaker readers will find it exhaustive) or the Harry Potter books (note: J.K Rowling deserves all the hype she's getting...and you'll notice if you compare book 1 and book 5 how much she's grown as a writer.)"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"For those who haven't read tolkien, this would be a thrilling adventure.

Taking an approach that has been sucessful is smart, and the book shouldn't be degraded for that. While the characters may not have been quite as personal as in books such as in the Dragonriders of Pern series, I thought that he did a decent job creating his main characters. The most important aspect of a book to me is that its plot is exciting, and makes me WANT to keep reading, and Eragon did that. The only thing I really had an issue with was the sometimes apparent predictibility of the novel (ie, he's going to be attacked right... now.)But overall, a solid book. I enjoyed reading it."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I had no idea what Paolini's book was going to be about when I first picked it up at Wal-Mart. Of course, it has been in the best-sellers section for quite some time and since it finally came out in paperback and therefore was not too expensive for a college student, I bought it. Now, you must understand that I am very skeptical of fantasy as a genre because it seems to be so cliched, however I was intrigued because this book was written by someone so young. So, why did I review it the way I did?Considering the author's age, especially at the start of his book, this could be considered a slightly impressive piece of work. His people all definitely have personality and it is fairly easy to differentiate between people if you are used to reading books with extensive character palates. My personal favorite character is Murtagh because he is so real. He is a real man's man and is a stout friend.There are however many flaws in this book. I am not attempting to destroy the work, however it is lacking and I will show why. First, his invented language is so near to English that if one sits and puzzles over the words in the sentences long enough one will be able to distinguish their meaning, especially if one has studied another language. The sentence structure of the ancient tongue also closely matches English which I find to be very implausible. Why do I pick on the language so much? Because Tolkien is my favorite author and he did it so well.Now, for the rest of the book. The story was interesting, but Eragon and Brom spend way too much of their time traveling. They can travel for as long as they need but the author took up so much time with it that I felt it was rather difficult to get into. It was not until Murtagh showed up that the book got really exciting.My last complaint with this book has to do with the part that magic plays in it. This could be considered mere personal opinion so don't take it too seriously. If you like magic playing a huge part in a character's life, then it will not bother you at all. However, if you like a character who has to defend his life and others with the sword on most occasions, you will be disappointed. I dislike the heavy use of magic and the way in which it causes him to be able to escape every difficult situation (excepting fighting the Shade). That is why I liked Murtagh so much, because he fought for everything. Magic may not be a cop-out to most, but, I apologize to those who like it, it is in my book. That is why I perfer history and mythology.This author shows promise for being able to weave intricate stories. However, he may need some training before he achieves literary greatness. I will probably read the second book when it comes out in paperback because the first one did leave me hanging."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"this is a great book. a real page turner!!! the made up language in this book is creative.!!! the story takes u the reader on a dangerous journey. kids, teens and adults can read this without being call a d&d geek. everyone reads this!!!!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I do not usually read fantasy books, but this is a really enjoyable read.

I do think that reviewers complaining about the book being very derivative from other touchstones of Fantasy literature to be accurate but with an overly harsh tone. It is immediately apparent that the prose is a bit immature but it also has a certain energy of someone who really enjoys Fantasy. It is nice change from some authors that take themselves way too seriously.I think this is a very approachable book for children (9 to 14 years old). It is an interest way to introduce some of the tried and true Fantasy concepts to people not so familiar with Fantasy literature.I found the book to be a quick and enjoyable read. I would not say it is a great work as some reviewers have claimed but it also better than a lot of other books being put into print. It is actually nice to have a book that you can put down and pick up after a chapter and keep up on it without much effort...a good distraction for very busy Fantasy fans.Rating:Prose: 3 stars -- some great descriptionsCharacters: 1 star -- very predictable, retread of classic charactersSetting: 3 stars -- interesting but again an amagalm of other fantasy worldsPacing: 5 stars -- it moves and flows very well"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Eragon is a fantasy book by Christopher Paolini. It is about a boy named Eragon, who finds a mysterious blue stone in a land no one ever goes into. The stone happenes to be a dragon egg. Eragon and his dragon go on a journey of a lifetime. He has only , a mystickal sword, a friends advice, and, of course, his dragon. Can Eragon find his destiny?This book makes you never want to put it down. It is one of my favorite books. Eragon is a good book for both girls and boys of all ages."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Having just finished reading Eragon I thought I would add my two cents worth about the book. I found the book enjoyable. Though some things just kept creeping into my mind. I'm an avid Harry Potter and Tolkien fan. I can see elements of both JK Rowling and J.R.R Tolkien's stories in the book. In Harry Potter the wand chooses the wizard.....in Eragon the dragon chooses the rider. In The Fellowship of the Ring they loose Gandalf their guide.....in Eragon he looses Brom his guide. In LOTR we have Boromir that Frodo doesn't completely trust....in Eragon we have Murtagh that Eragon doesn't completely trust. The names of the cities were similiar to the ones used in Tolkiens work. The Green Dragon in LOTR...The Green Chesnut in Eragon. I could go on and on. Considering the author was 15 when he embarked on his adventure in writing, I'm cutting him some slack and hope that we see great improvements and some orginal stuff in Eldest when it it published. Like I said before the book was enjoyable if you take it at face value. However do not expect another The Lord of the Rings or The Silmarillion or Hobbit level book because it's not. Those are all master works....this is not....though it is a good first attempt at a book for a person so young and hopefully his writing will only improve over time."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Young Paolini has the makings of a good writer, perhaps even a great writer, if he stops imitating Tolkien. This book feels stiff in certain parts because you can very easily anticipate the action. And at times dialogue reads more like a B-movie than a fantasy novel. That said, there is a lot of enjoyable material in this book. Paolini is very talented, but I keep coming back to the feeling that I've read most of this before when reading other fantasy writers. I think it's time for the author to sit down and compare his notes with those of others and concentrate on his own material. Personally, I think that his style of writing is typical of his age. As the author matures, so should his writing. I look forward to reading his books in the future."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"this book is clearly one of the best books i have ever read. There are viollent parts and sad parts. If you are the type of person who likes adventure books this is a book for you."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I enjoyed this book so much that I grabbed the sequel Eldest right away. Anyone would love this book too.Living with his uncle Garrow and his cousin Roran, fifteen-year-old Eragon had a plain, simple life as a farmer in the land of Alagaseia. His day consisted of farming and hunting.\`But, as he ventures into the mountains called the Spine, a mysterious stone appears in a burst of energy. Perplexed by the stone, he and his uncle ask a trader about how much it's worth. Unfortunately, the merchant has no idea how much it's worth or what it really is. Eragon soon finds out when the stone hatches and reveals a dragon! When Eragon touches the dragon, his palm shows a shining insignia. Eragon recalls the stories that Brom, an old storyteller, had told of the Riders and how they maintained peace throughout the land. Eragon asks Brom about the dragons without arousing suspicion, including the names of the dragons that helped the Riders. Eragon realizes his dragon is a girl and names her Saphira. But Brom, being a clever old man, discovers Eragon's plan to kill the Ra'zaac for murdering his uncle. Reluctantly, Eragon agrees to let Brom join him on his journey.This book would appeal to any kind of reader because it is an excellent book of magic and dragons! This is a must read book! Two years ago I couldn't stand reading this book. But now, I regret and take back everything I said about this book once you read up to when Saphira hatches, you won't want to stop!!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"The story was great and all but I do feel that the author copied a little bit. Eragon came frome the term of Aragorn from the lord of the rings. The fights on the other hand are awsome. I already know that they shall soon be making a movie out of this at the end of 2006. The enemies were sort of copied too. The so called Urgals a type of orc-like creature had something that represented the uruk-hai: the Kull faster,stronger, and bigger. But at least Christopher Paolini didnt copy the story.I would recomend the story to any one who likes fantasy"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"While I do enjoy the overall storyline, and I have to give him credit for being somewhat inventive in his explanations, the dialogue is downright awful. No, it's not Star Wars Episode I-III bad, but it's bad.The main character is flawed, but probably not in the way the author intended. Some of the interaction between he and the \\"amazingly, jaw-droppingly, super duper incredibly incomprehensibly beautifully gorgeous OH MY GOD\\" elf, Alya, is nauseating. (\\"You're here to fight?! It's too dangerous!\\"). This in spite of the fact that she had just the other day easily defeated him in a duel with only one hand on her sword. She not only outclasses him in every way possible, but she's much faster, stronger and, it seems, smarter.Another serious problem with this novel is the vocabulary. I'm 19, and had a vocabulary roughly equal to that of a 22 year old when I was 15- which is the base age he's catering to- and there were at least twenty words which I didn't know the meaning of, ten of which I had never even seen before- most of this in the second half of the book, for whatever reason. And that isn't counting the words he seems to have made up. It is, though, counting absurdly obscure words like \\"wyrd,\\" no pun intended- from Greek mythology, and then continues to use them as if they're actual words. Now I'm not complaining, looking up words is no problem, but I can't imagine what it would have been like for me at 13 trying to wade through the book. He uses a lot of words that aren't even every-day, like names for specific types of quartz. It's a little maddening, and you just know he's doing it on purpose, because he'll use the same words again later in the book instead of using synonyms- which anyone with a brain knows, you're supposed to do.Remembering names proved quite easy, though not for all the ridiculously convoluted names he gave to his cities; though perhaps for lack of effort- they were so ridiculous I just rolled my eyes.I strongly dislike the way he talks about magic, with stupid little phrases like, \\"but you must be the one to wield the magic.\\" Give me a break. All the dialogue is in perfectly proper English; no contractions, no slang, except when they are talking to the lowly enemy guards, where they speak in an dramatically overdone lower-class dialect. Apparently, Paolini doesn't realize that just because they're the enemy, they don't necessarily have to be stupid.It does turn the pages pretty well, though I'm not sure if it's because I'm trying to escape the horrid dialogue to get to the more interesting parts or not.It seems all I've done is complain, which actually isn't what I intended to do, but I just can't think of enough positives to bother writing about.Despite this, it's worth picking up, though probably not worth buying the hard cover version.It seems to me he not only pulled on the obvious Lord of the Rings, but Star Wars and even Harry Potter."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I often find myself reading teen literature as I work in a middle and high school.

Who doesn't copy a little? Overall this was a great book and I say keep up the good work!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I have to admit, I bought this book solely based on the fact that it was written by someone who wasn't yet 20 years old. Unfortunately, I think that's exactly why it's become so popular.It's a statement of hope for aspiring authors (for the wrong reasons), and a motivation for children with dreams. Had this book been presented to a publishing house by a washed up middle aged man living in his mothers basement, it likely would have been swept into the slush pile as a derivative ripoff of every halfway decent fantasy cliche ever used. Trouble is, this story doesn't do anything interesting with the cliches.I do give Paolini credit for impressive linguistic style, especially for someone his age. I just found myself looking forward to the last page so that I could move on and read something more interesting. At no point in the story will you ever say \\"Wow, very creative!\\" It's just page after page of \\"yeah, I suppose that's about what I expected to happen.\\"Is this novel good enough to be one of the bestselling books in the country? Not even close.Does it deserve a movie license? Definitely not.Are there far more interesting stories on the shelves that don't receive a fraction of the publicity that Eragon does? Thousands of them."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"The book Eragon caught my attention by the picture of the Dragon on it. I bought it out of curiosity. Initially the book seemed brilliant, the prolouge was excellent, Paolini has described the characters in full detail not unlike the Tolkien style. As the book proceeds it starts losing some of its brilliance as it gets a totally Lord of The Rings style but that after lots of thinking the conclusion I came to was That this point should not be taken into view as the book was written by a 17 yr old rather young BOY. Lord of the Rings seems to influence almost every last page of the book but the book surely is worth reading by young and old alike even though Paolini creates a magical world followin tolkien's footsteps."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Eragon is an awesome read for people of all ages, ecspecially those who enjoy fantasy. Eragon has managed to hold my attention better than many fantasy books including the Lord of the Rings series. It's a fantastic story about a boy that enters the ranks of the legendary &quot;Dragon Riders&quot;. I don't want to give too much away so honestly if you have a chance read Eragon it's incredible. Just one warning start early in the evening, if you don't you'll find it's well past midnight before you manage to find a good place to leave off."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I bought this book as a christmas present for a woman who loves children's books, and fantasy books in particular. Unfortunately while Eragon might be compelling to a teenager, it's almost unbearable to people with more of a nuanced perspective to the world. Think of it as a story for people who still like the taste of artificial grape flavoring.First, the story as a whole has no arc. Or rather, it borrows several arcs that have been used before, and merely concatenates them together. It starts out as a story about coming into unexpected responsibility, learning skills, etc. There's a limpid revenge theme that starts up and falters a few times. Then the reader is thrown into a love interest that was forshadowed in a most heavy-handed manner, and which is described in such embarassingly adolescent language that I winced (as did another reviewer). Eventually the story turns into a race against time, except that they refuse to take advantage of their winged dragon, who can fly vast distances very quickly.There are annoying little inconsistencies. For example, in the beginning of the book they seem to cover about an inch of map in a week. At the end, they're covering the same distance in a day.At one point, about 100 pages in, I felt as if the writing had developed an iron-lung style rythm. I didn't analyze it enough to find out what exactly was going on, but I think it was a span of several pages filled with sentences that all followed identical grammatical structures. It was a very unpleasant sensation to read through; kind of like a sing-song poem where the lines all rhyme and have the same number of syllables.At the end of the book, Eragon hasn't actually achieved anything, except to memorize the lessons that were handed to him on a silver platter by suspiciously knowledgeable and conveniently-placed characters. He has nothing to be proud of -- I had the distinct feeling that I had just read about a rich boy collecting all the opportunities and advantages that a rich boy should expect. This feeling wasn't helped by the fact that this book was originally published by Paolini's parents' publishing house -- I get the distinct feeling that if the author hadn't been bankrolled by his family, this story never would have seen the public.There are some promising parts to the writing, however. The description of baby Saphira was endearing. The description of the dwarf stronghold was beautiful. Replacing the idea of \\"good guys vs bad guys\\" with a power struggle between equally self-interested groups was promising, although it wasn't carried out very well (it's clear that one group really is supposed to be better than the other). I look forward to the author gaining more experience with storytelling, character development, and life struggles in general. Maybe someday I'll be able to recommend one of his books."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"OK OK, so the author is only a teenager, and I give him kudos for his initiative. However, I liken his effort to all of those romance novels that are written by bored housewives --- it is very nice that the initiative is there, but it is nothing we have not seen a thousand times before.Only the most dense reader could fail to see the obvious imitations of Tolkein strewn liberally throughout the work. Paolini may someday develop into a writer of some distinction, but for now he is a verbose imitation of the many fantasy authors that have preceded him. Even his decision to frame his story in the form of a trilogy is irritating --- how many trilogies can the world endure? Just because practically every other fantasy author has done it doesn't mean Paolini has to do it as well.Definitely, this is juvenile literature, written by a juvenile author & best left to young readers without much literary experience. Judged on its own merits, this book leaves little lasting impact."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"First, I did not know anything about the writer when I picked up the book at my local book store. I just wanted a fresh story for the weekend.I found myself baffled at the low quality of it all. The story is the most stereotypical thing you could ever come up with, still, that was the only thing I could actually enjoy. That is... if I just skipped reading more than perhaps one word each three lines.The characters are non-sensical and flat, the descriptions of the surroundings uninteresting and the dialogs are so stiff that you wan't to weep. Christopher just doesn't have any feel for drama.I found myself thinking that I actually could have written this. Perhaps even better. And then I read about Christopher and realized that I actually did write stuff like this when I was in that age.The difference between me and Mr. Paolini is that I read my own work and realized that it just wasn't good enough.Just to sum it up: I am very hard pressed to come up with any piece of fantasy that I've read that is actually worse than this book."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"First off, I want to say that I am slightly biased. I worship J.R.R. Tolkien and his epic, beautiful, lyrical works. I also respect other writers such as David Eddings, J.K. Rowling, and Ursula Leguin. So maybe my preferences led me to a book with a gorgeous blue dragon that looked distinctly human on the cover. When I first happened upon Eragon, I had no idea who the author was (or, shall I say, how OLD he was) and I had never heard of it before (ignorance is bliss). So when I picked it up, I read the first couple of pages, and I was a lost cause. Though there are many factors that contribute to Eragon's failings as a fantasy novel (or a novel in general), the two most blatant are writing using a photocopier and writing without the skill to do so. I admire Christopher Paolini so much because he has sufficient firmness to go on with such an epic (the task, not the result) task till the end. But the admiration ends there. I don't think that his age should excuse the pomposity and dullness of his language and overall lack of technical skill. He has a real knack for taking a whole lot of SAT level vocab, putting it together, and making it mean NOTHING AT ALL. How's this for an example... \\"May thee who enter here forget thine impermanence and that which is beloved\\"; this is an inscription on the citadel of Dras-Leona, and I still can't grasp it. There is just something so superficial and fake about CP's writing style that I know for sure his novel is popular only because of the intricate plot rather than a sublime and beautiful mastery of the English language. Though he graduated at 15, I guess he didn't take Creative Writing 101. My next pet peeve is a fairly common one, and it is that there is not one ounce of originality in Eragon. I won't bore you with all the sordid details, but don't expect anything new, and don't expect anything great from Eragon. At best, it is a mildly interesting, simplistic novel that that will deliver you from extreme boredom. At worst, it is a poor attempt by an adoring fan to emulate those who are far, far greater than he. Maybe later, CP, but for now, you aren't fit to wipe Tolkien's shoes. SHAME ON YOU!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I'm reviewing Eragon, by Christopher Paolini.He started writing this book when he was fifteen, and it shows. At the beginning of the book his writing is childish, he goes out of his way to describe meaningless details. (Who needs to know exactly how many left and right turns there are on the pathway? The readers aren't going to be quizzed on that, now are they?)Unfortunately, the book does not get better as its writer ages. It is full of lamentably overused fantasy cliches (elves are, surprise surprise, once again the \\"perfect\\" race of creatures with superintelligence and fabulous good looks. The orcs- excuse me, \\"Urgals\\", are the dumb, beastly pawns of the 'terrifyingly evil overlord'.) and story lines that a four-year-old could see coming. The main character's wise old mentor is actually a knight of the ancient order? Who would have guessed! Eragon's new friend has a mysterious past? Oh, horrors!Halfway into the book, our 'fearless hero' (merely a Luke Skywalker in Frodo Baggins clothing) begins to have dreams about the standard-issue Beautiful Heroine. Of course, she is a beautiful Elf that will fall madly in love with our hero after he rescues her. I was rooting for the Elf to die before Eragon was able to save her. Young Master Paolini had the perfect chance to skew the fantasy stereotypes that plauge this genre, but instead he chose the safe route and it paid off: his book is a bestseller, a title that is in no way deserved. Do NOT lap this book up and proclaim it to be the \\"next harry potter\\" or, god forbid, the next Lord Of The Rings. THOSE two series have good, thought-provoking books and are always willing to shatter fantasy stereotypes. Don't waste your time or money on this same-old, same-old book. Your money shall be better spent elsewhere.I honestly think that the only reason this book was published was because the author's PARENTS own a publishing company."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I was given this book as a Christmas present and decided to read it. I'm 41, by the way, and have read a few books and written a few stories in my day. I see this book has received over a thousand reviews so I'll keep mine short.Good points:The writing is technically sound for the most part (by that I mean at least grammatically correct) and the writer followed the classic pattern of the \\"epic\\" (hero travels around discovering secrets of him/her self and growing in power reaching a climax of killing the evil one).Bad points:The plot is completely cliche and \\"safe\\", woven from the fabric of all the stories the author had loved (Star Wars, Dragon Riders of Pern, Lord of the Rings, and perhaps even The Song of Albion and others) prior to writing his story. He even names the evil empire, \\"the Empire\\"! Tip of the hat or uninspired plagiarism?His writing style reflects his age: way too many adverbs and he repeatedly violates the \\"show don't tell\\" mantra of professional writers everywhere. Don't tell me that Eragon was worried. SHOW me by telling me that Eragon's brow wrinkled or he pulled at his face with open hands or some such VISUAL clue that he was worried. His adjectives and adverbs often feel as if he'd simply pulled them from a thesaurus and he had never heard of the words until then.There are COUNTLESS illogical situations that made me want to give up on the book long before I finished it. Eragon is traveling to the Varden along with Murtagh and the poisoned elf. They have a dragon and 2 horses and need to get there ASAP but instead of Eragon flying there via his dragon, they'd rather trot along on horses! Boy, I really felt the suspense. It simply is a reflection of the lack of reasoning skills of the author due to his age.No real resolution is achieved by the end of the book but much is revealed along the way.The battle scene at the end was so devoid of graphic descriptions and suspense that it seemed the author was unsure exactly who his audience should be. Out of thousands of Urgals, Dwarves and men, only one or two is described as dying.I could go on but I won't. This book is probably worth two stars but I gave one to try and offset the hundreds of reviews by readers who are not yet to the age where they can understand exactly what \\"master Paolini\\" has accomplished. I think he could be a great writer - in time.Summary: If you are new to epic fantasy literature, by all means, read this if you want. Otherwise, avoid it. Why waste your time on a two-star work when there are more five-star works than you could read in a lifetime?"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"First of all, I love to read. I devour books almost obscenely. J.R.R. Tolkien, J.K. Rowling, C.S. Lewis, Brian Jaques, Richard Adams, Orson Scott Card, Susan Cooper Stephen R. Donaldson, George R.R. Martin, Diana Wynne Jones, Caroline Funke, Shakespeare, Whoever the heck translated Beowulf, Homer, etc. And when I first heard in eighth grade that a teenager had written a book I was in awe. It was my lifelong (or since the fifth grade) dream to write a book. I couldn't wait to get my hands on it. I remember, when I bought it, I tore into it ravenously, like a starving man on a Christmas ham.By the end of the prologue, I was beginning to have my doubts. And just a short way into the book, I was already disappointed. But I plowed ahead, giving the book a chance. However, all things considered, I have to admit that I did not like this book at all. It was a cute plot. Common, yes, but cute. In fact, if written well, it had the potential to be charming. A farm kid who lives with his uncle finds a dragon and they go off on adventures together to save life as the way they know it from an evil Emperor. Sounds like a good ride. I'm a sucker for the ride, you know. I fall for it all, the lead, the hook, and I allow the author to drag me on a wild ride. Sometimes, I purposefully try not to figure out what's going to happen just to be surprised. But Paolini's book was SO typical that I found myself predicting (correctly!) exactly what was going to happen next. Do not get me wrong, I feel that Paolini has talent. He just needs to develop it and start thinking originally. He needs to broaden his horizons, read non fantasy books, and read reviews of his stories on sites like this one and learn his weaknesses so he can focus some of his attention there. Maybe he should study different time periods in history, find out what they wore, how people lived, what tools they used. I'm taking a college course history class that is offered by my high school and I've found that because I'm more knowledgeable about the histories and cultures of different places in the world my writing is more realistic, more tangible. Just a few suggestions. I've heard that Paolini doesn't read reviews of his work. I don't know if this is true or not, but if it is I don't think it's right. As Hermione said in Harry Potter : \\"It's always best to know what the enemy is saying\\" (or something like that) and besides, knowing what you're doing wrong can only make you a better writer. But I'm getting a little preachy here, which is not my intent...moving on.This book screams Lord of the Rings. In truth I was expecting Gollum to pop out from behind a bush any second, or Bilbo Baggins to suddenly appear out of no where. Some may think I'm being a little harsh, they may say that all authors borrow and steal ideas from one another. And that is the absolute truth, I agree with them completely. But the similarities were so blatant in Christopher Paolini's work that I was left with the feeling that I was reading Lord of the Rings fanfiction. But he was seventeen when he wrote that, and I knew first hand how hard it was to come up with original ideas when we are surrounded by wonderful literature. Besides when you boil it down, fantasy is good vs. evil period. You can only do so much, and often, you find that all of the great ideas have already been taken. Thinking of new ones is a stretch. The ability to come up with them is the mark of a great author. Paolini, however, did not show the capacity to come up with original ideas or to even twist the old ones to make them his own. That disappointed me.I'll talk about the prologue with brutal honesty. I hated it. I thought it was stupid, poorly written, and awkward. It was an essential bit of information to Paolini's \\"plot\\" (by now, I was using the word loosely) and it was obvious that he didn't know how to introduce it. It may've just not fit anywhere else so...PLOOP! he throws it at the beginning and says TO HECK WITH IT! That's my theory anyway. The prologue was about his villain...the Shade Durza, I think. (Paolini seems to think that all villains must have an x, y, or z in their name. I think it's cheesy...is that how you spell it? Whatever.) We next meet characters (Urgals) who are clearly carbon copies of every goblin/orc creature we have ever encountered in modern literature. And what can make this happy picture more complete? Well why not add a couple of pretty elves on horses who just so happen to be riding through this dark, gloomy forest in the middle of the night? Sure, why not? Oh God.In anycase, these elves who (if we know elves!) have the eyes, ears, and noses of many different highly perseptive animals combined AND their marvelous steeds do not sense these stinky Urgals and the questionable terror of the Shade until it is Too Late. Of course, two of the elves are killed immediately, leaving the all too important and predictable elf gal to suffer the malice of the malice-less creatures who now surround her. I wouldn't be too worried about this girl if she wasn't a complete moron.(By the who...this is most of Eragon's plot:Let's make the fatally beautiful damsel in distress dumb as a forty-two pound turd so she can get captured by the 'oh-so-scary' bad guy with the dark motives so that, eventually, once he has met the omnipresent Obi-Wan/Yoda/Gandalf guru-teacher man, and after he has passed through many trials and tribulations the noble hero, who is nowadays manufactured from the standard 'noble hero' guidelines, can save her, and...finally...the world in the process.)Anyway, the prologue... it consists of painfully showy magic, all of the elves getting slain (as I have aforementioned) except for Arya (a name from George R.R. Martin's books I might add, but okay. I don't think that you can get sued for stealing a name. Well except for Harry Potter...whatever)...and the oh-so mysterious object of the bad guy's desire. Which, to my surprise wasn't the elf. I commend you there, Paolini, you surprised me...for the first and last time. However, my elation was short lived because the mysterious thing turns out to be \\"the last dragon egg\\" that is left in the existence in the entire world! hmmm.Of course, for good measure, the Shade takes the elf lady too.I'm on the edge of my seat here.I read on this site underneath the description of the 2nd book what Paolini said about his writing. That part about striving for lyrical beauty between Tolkein and the guy that translated Beowulf. I laughed myself out of my computer chair and onto the floor. If what is said about him not taking criticsim or attending college is true then that is an extremely arrogant thing to say. He is no where near Tolkien, or any other fantasy writer that I have read for that matter.A note to Paolini: Learn modesty, take writing classes, improve yourself. There is no shame bettering yourself.In short, this story was like a kiddy roller coaster at my local six flags. It may be fun if you've never ridden anything before, but after you've experienced the big guns (i.e. the authors in the 1st paragraph) it's really dull.In other words, if you are looking for a book of Tolkien and Rowling quality...steer clear."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I recently read both books in this series and I do have to comment on it.Yes every fantasy author borrows from others,most often Tolkien,who those authors in turn borrowed from earlier works and so back and back...but there is a difference here in the borrowing. I don't have problem that the young author of this book borrowed such ideas,but rather that in borrowing them he did not implement them in a fashion that is both subtle and a slight nod to those that he did...unlike those authors that have borrowed before him. Also of note on something that I did not much care for was really encapsulated by the movie (which is another thing entirely but bears mentioning here) in that it seems time and physics did not seem to come into play too much...most especially in the movie but also to a lesser extent in the book as well. It is true that many authors and writers of both books,movies,and especially TV shows stretch time and physics to fit their plot (as J.M. S. once said of the ship speeds in Babylon 5 \\"the ship moves as fast as the plot needs\\"),but those that do have done so with an elegance and almost invisible touch to it...while the young author of this series does so like an avalanche down a mountain side.It's disheartening to know that chances are the author of the series will likely never move forward in his style and writing skills as his fame and money that he has made and will continue to make on the sale of this series will blind him (the old dollar signs in the eye syndrome rearing it's ugly head). Because this work shows some promise for an early author...much like the works of many writers do when they are first going to their writing classes and all.I can only imagine that the reason this series has become so popular is because of it's marketing...which as history shows is the key to making money and fame."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I really don't get why this book is so highly praised. Yes I get that someone younger than myself wrote this book and I probably couldn't do a better job of writing it, but its NOT THAT GREAT. As everyone has been saying, it stole a bunch of ideas from other influential fantasy novels, which is fine but it poorly mooshed them all together to make a really long, dry book. Great storyline, but it could have been played up a lot more. It was too long. And it's not that I don't like long books. I love Harry Potter and the Count of Monte Cristo, but they are able to hold my attention and admiration the whole way through. This one was hard to get through. I bought the second book and still haven't read it because I'm dreading that it will be the same thing all over again. I will see the movie and hopefully that will be more exciting than the book."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Personally, I mildly enjoyed this book, but not to the extent that I will claim that I love it. It's a decent story in its own right, and an amazing work coming from someone so young, but it does have glaring flaws that can hardly be overlooked.The StoryIf it had been the first time I had ever read a fantasy, I would have been impressed by the plot. However, after reading Tolkien's Middle-earth series (The Silmarillion, The Hobbit, LOTR), Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials, and J. K. Rowling's HP series, I am sorely disappointed at the lack of imagination and breakthrough. It reminds me too much of Tolkien's ME, from the fictitious country Alagaesia, to Eragon's quest and transformation, from the trite descriptions of Elves, Dwarves and other creatures (Elves are perfect and ethereal, Dwarves are bearded and short-tempered, Urgals for Orcs, Kulls for Uruk-hais), to the stereotypical portrayal of good and evil (good are beautiful, evil are ugly). Even the \\"plot twists\\" and \\"riddles\\" that are meant to surprise seem unbearably obvious (Brom's past and his death, Eragon and the Elf, Murtagh's true identity ... I bet Eragon would sail for Valinor - or whatever replacement name Paolini can conjure up for *The Undying Land* - after his journey came to an end, just like Frodo did). It's an interesting account of a young man's growing up and accepting his true destiny, but this is such an OLD theme, a theme that has been beaten to death in ME series and even Star Wars series. Eragon appeared to be a blend of Aragorn, Frodo and Luke Skywalker. Even for a new fantasy reader like me, the story is hardly original or exciting.The WritingThis is the part that bothers me the most. The writing style so closely mimics Tolkien's that the whole story reads like a watered-down, abridged, simplified, \\"made for the mass\\" version of ME series. I can cite numerous examples that strike me as oddly familiar:* the choice of words: \\"slay\\" instead of \\"kill\\", \\"fair\\" instead of \\"beautiful\\", \\"mirth\\" instead of \\"happiness\\", \\"occur\\" instead of \\"happen\\".* \\"it came to pass that...\\": an expression frequently used in The Silmarillion* \\"all may not be lost\\": Brom for Gandalf?* the blatant use of ME language Tolkien created is everywhere (the different tongues, multiple names for the same thing, etc.)* strange use of adjectives: (when describing the Elf lady at the beginning) \\"she drew herself up with regal distain\\" - \\"regal distain\\", huh?! (when describing Urgals) \\"wicked sword\\"... \\"wicked dagger\\" - eh, how can these mere tools be wicked?* lavish use of archaic and pedantic words: I almost suspected that he held a thesaurus in hand and checked out the longest and most seldom used word from a list of synonyms.* over elaborate descriptions of places. At first I found them to be intriguing and vivid but towards the end I got weary and just jumped over most of them.Emotional ImpactThe story also runs thin in terms of its emotional impact. It lacks the epic scale and historic weight of ME series, and the daring imagination of the HP series. It has neither the subtle humor of LOTR, nor the instant hilarity of HP series. Although attempts at humor are made, they always seem forced and clumsy. I couldn't bring myself to care about the characters and only one of them is remotely interesting (Murtagh). I didn't feel compelled to finish the book in one sitting, and I am certainly not eager for the second installment.In short, this is an impressive debut for such a young author (and no doubt a promising one given time), and an interesting enough story for those who haven't read other better fantasies. If you have read HP, ME series or The Golden Compass, don't bother with this one."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"The plots, the charactors,and the story are very good, and there is a bunch of detail.

However, someone who knew I like Anne McCaffrey thought I might enjoy this, and I received it as a gift. Reading it was the only polite thing to do.I quickly became absorbed in it, and it went everywhere with me (MD appts.; work; school; long bus rides; -- but not the tub!).I admit I found references to other works (McCaffrey; Rowling; Battlestar Gallactica; Star Wars; et al), but that told me the young author was well read. I admired his style, and thoroughly enjoyed the way the book was brought together. I believe there will be some revelations in \\"Elders\\" that will confirm some ideas I have re storylines. Some of these (my ideas) were pretty obvious (I thought), but I still enjoyed this first work. I am sure Paolini will grasp of subtlety will improve with experience.\\"Just Ivy\\" (FL) says no typos were found.

Eragon is an excellent story that combines fantasy with adventure to make a truly awesome book to read. If you are a fan of The Lord of the Rings, you would really enjoy Eragon.After no luck hunting, the poor farm boy, Eragon, would have to buy his family meat for the winter with the little money they had. He stumbles across a polished, flawless, blue stone in the woods, which perhaps he could buy meat for his family with. But when the blue stone hatches into a baby dragon, Eragon's simple life becomes greatly more significant. But when his uncle is brutally murdered, Eragon must navigate the dangerous terrain of Alagaesia with only an ancient sword and the advice of a wise old storyteller to avenge his uncle's death.The author, Chistopher Paolini, began writing this phenomenal book at the age of fifteen. At nineteen years old he became a New York Times bestselling author. He was inspired to write Eragon by his abiding love for fantasy and science fiction. He lives in Paradise Valley, Montana where he is working on Eldest the next book in the Inheritance trilogy.I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys fantasy or adventure books. Eragon is very similar to The Lord of the Rings books in a sense of travel, fighting, magic, and adventure. Eragon is a great book."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"The things that pulled me to buy this book:the author starting writing it at age 15.the cover was pretty.it was around 30 dollars but scholastics pushed it down to 19.99.Sold.At first, i delayed the book since i didn't anticipate the book back..but..it has a grip.

The plot line was terrific with a blend of action adventure and romance. As if the ancient language wasnt enough the guide at the end of the book was a touch of brilliance."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"The problem here isn't really that Paolini has pilfered other authors' ideas. That, in itself, wouldn't be a problem if the story, characters and dialogue were engaging. I happen to find The Sword of Shannara a fun read, even though it lifted nearly every character archetype and concept from Lord of the Rings (a charge which Brooks denies, btw). But Terry Brooks was able to make the world of Shannara unique or at least somewhat his own (Brooks also wrote some other good Shannara books, such as Elfstones of Shannara). I'm not saying Brooks is a tremendous author, but his works have at least something to offer.But Eragon's characters and story aren't engaging, his world suggests nothing uniqe and the book is not particularly well written. With so many disparate elements pulled from other works, he has created a sort of \\"Frankenstein's Monster\\" of fantasy novels. The book is rather hodgepodge; there is no backbone, no weight, no glue. At least it has none of its own but tries to assume that of other books, almost through osmosis. Ideas are taken from other works (the names of which have already been mentioned ad nauseum) and just sort of inserted. It has a sort of \\"write-by-numbers\\" feel to it.The story lacks a strong sense or weight of history, though the author tries to effect such throughout the book. Things just sort of happen because they're supposed to according to the usual fantasy story template not because the author had any particular vision. The result is, unfortunately, artificial.For example, the boy Eragon becomes a so-called (and quite accomplished) Rider before the reader even gets a sense of or appreciate what a Rider is (assuming they're unfamiliar with McCaffrey's Pern series, that is). Also, concepts and past events are exposited to no end and too quickly as the story moves along, giving the work a rushed feel. Even the initial \\"quest\\" is rather weak, involving nothing more than a desire for revenge by Eragon (and an uninteresting episode or two that involves looking up shipping records). This is the hook by which Eragon ultimately becomes the \\"chosen one\\" (or a chosen one) and it's pretty non-compelling stuff. The stilted dialogue and lack of humor in the book doesn't help.All this is understandable for a young author. I'm sure ever aspiring author has done something of the same for his/her first stab at writing fantasy. The problem with Paolini's book is that someone went and published it.Another point I'd like make (and which has raised by others) is I'm wondering why this is being sold as a children's book. Even in adult fantasy, call me crazy, but I'm not sure the sight of an impaled baby is something readers necessarily want to conjure in their minds. Such a sight would almost be a shock even in George R. R. Martin's Song of Ice and Fire series. Presumably, it's to make the as-yet unseen villain to be as evil as possible, but it's forced, excessive and reeks of shock value. If you have to resort to such blatant tactics to make your villains despicable, you're on the wrong track, imo. There are other graphic descriptions of violence in the book that seem out of place in what is allegedly a children's book. Again, this is understandable in the sense that the writer hasn't even come close to perfecting his craft. But someone told him his book was good (his parents, in fact) and they went and published it, so there's little chance that Paolini will improve his skills as a writer (especially as he is alleged to ignore criticism - good and bad), if his books keep making the bestseller list.I did see potential in the book and there were some passages I actually found somewhat interesting. Unfortunately, the overall concept is just too derivative and the potential is never truly realised. The idea needed further development, ingenuity and lots of rewrites.A few final thoughts:I'm curious as to the frequent comparison in these reviews between the name Eragon and Aragorn of Lord of the Rings. The resemblance is superficial, nothing more, and there is little resemblance between the two characters. If anything, there would seem to be a greater resemblance between Eragon and Dave Edding's Garion (perhaps another name to add to the list of ideas that Paolini borrowed); the archetypes appear to be similar there (I say 'appear' because I've not read anything of Eddings), as do the names (if you substitute the 'e' in Eragon, with an 'i,' you can spell 'Garion').As far as his borrowing other ideas, he's not the only one. Besides the previously mentioned authors, Star Wars itself is hardly an entirely unique story, having borrowed from such works as LotR and the movies of Akira Kurosawa. It's not the fact that Paolini pilfering these concepts from others, it's that he's not doing anything interesting with them. Again, the amateurish feel of the work is entirely understandable. What's puzzling is that it's been published and that so many people have failed to see it for what it is."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Eragon seemed like a book I really wanted to buy when I had first heard of it. Usually I'm very intuitive about books and I've bought many books without even reading them, trusting that I would certainly love them. Nine times out of ten, that is the case. But Eragon turned out the be the one out of ten that I wish I hadn't bought. Initially, it seems worth the time to read it. But I was nearly half way through the book when it occured to me that I had no particular feelings towards any of the characters. The story lacks emotion and the level of familiarity in the course of events that is necessary for a reader to truly connect with the characters and relate to them. I found that I was growing bored with the story, which seemed to be a strange combination of DragonHeart, The Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, and a little bit of Harry Potter thrown in. It has been suggested that \\"Eragon\\" will rival The Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter. All in all, \\"Eragon\\" just tries too hard to keep up with those classics, and doesn't come close to delivering the unique quality of its predecessors. I would not recommend buying this book unless you read it first and really like it, or just like to collect fantasy novels."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I admit it, I bought the book for the art and color. I know, this is akin to buying alcohol for the bottle. I was bored, it was large, it was pretty, and I like Dragons and McCaffrey's work.I didn't know a teenager wrote it until I saw the reviews here. Yes, the author is clearly influenced by many great fantasy authors. OK, he is not yet in the halls of the most unique novelists (at a mere age 18). So? A bazillion fantasy books out there are 'more of the same'. He has some fairly unique perspectives and facets here and there, even though he accepts many of the most popular 'standards' of certain aspects of fantasy.I see all this bashing the book because it fails to separate itself from every known 'given' in the fantasy genre. That's like dissing a movie because lots of movies are about murder and intrigue with guns, car crashes, beautiful women and ugly bad guys. An art form is either entertaining, or it is not. It may be innovative, or less so than usual, it may have some very unique pieces and others that are almost 'tradition' instead.But the enjoyment of the process through it is what matters. Personally, I really enjoyed the book.It's not uncommon for young artists (of book or song or vision) to be more 'influenced' by those artists they like the best, than more experienced artists tend to be. For a first book this author writes a lovely and entertaining story, writes well (and long). I think his future is very bright, assuming the young man can survive the nasty effects of popularity hitting at that age and on his first book... pretty much a killshot for most personalities.I loathe trilogies, since I don't like being kept hanging for 1-3 years, but the book is good anyway.

The people who know something about good writing and therefore know how badly written Eragon is and they are not happy about it.3. The people who think the book is boring and predictable and can't finish it.Personally, I didn't like it because the female characters in Eragon are a joke. Well, all the characters are, but especially the females.I think if you buy it you'll probably regret it.

In his book, Eragon, we see a fundamental problem with this label: Lack of creativity. Nobody can question the depth of the world. Nobody can question Paolini's prose.What I object to is the fact that he has done little to no innovating in this story. His characters lack depth. Sure, they have casual relationships with one another, ones that are tested as they would be in any story. But Paolini rarely goes beneath the surface to get to the root of his character's emotions. Any good author knows character depth comes from complex relationships. Eragon's characters scratch the surface, but that is all. He does not have the depth of early McCaffrey, nor the unique writing style of some of Sc-fi/fantasy's real wunderkinds, like William Gibson, for example.Perhaps this is only a notion I can truly attest to but here is how I see it: If I, at age 16, can write an far more original story at this age than Paolini (I am in the process of writing my own novel, and I'm about 200 pages in. Forgive me if I sound like I have a serious case of writer's envy.), and I don't consider myself a \\"wunderkind\\" nor a \\"prodigy\\", than certainly Mr. Paolini should not be given props for rehashing other writer's stories and cashing in because of his age.That's called cashing in. That's not innovating. While it is very hard to write a novel, especially an original story (as I am finding out), he deserves props for writing a decent one. Still, he does not qualify, in my mind, as a \\"prodigy\\","},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"For all you review-readers out there, save yourself the money and don't get this book. As stated by so many here before, it's a rip-off of, to name a few, Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, Pern, Earthsea, etc. Paolini can't even make up his own language. If you look carefully at the words, they sound /strangely/ like synonyms of the word they're supposed to mean. Let me see, the word vonder for a thin, straight stick, can I say 'WAND'? Or how about thrysta for thrust... arget for silver? The word for silver in latin is argentium. GET ORIGIONAL, CP.And for those who say, \\"oh, he wrote it at the age of 15!\\" he didn't.

However, trying to read the book, I completely fail to understand why anyone in their right mind would want to make a film of this crap. And why are they making such a fuss about the book and its author? Oh, he is young .... So what? His lack of experience and talent is obvious from the very first chapter on. His writing style is poor, almost painfully so.The whole story is like a heap put together from ideas of Lord of the Rings, Wheel of Time, etc. There is nothing you haven't read before and the poor quality of plot, characters and language of course cannot make up for the unoriginality.Don't waste time and money on this book ... or ... Oh my! ... the sequels."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Regarding the upcoming movie Eragon, based on his bestselling novel, author Christopher Paolini said, \\"I originally conceived Eragon as a movie. I saw the characters and action clearly in my mind. But since I didn't have the money to produce a film, I ended up writing the story as a book.\\" This is exactly what is wrong with Eragon. It reads, as Paolini himself implied, like a movie; but because it is not a movie we are deprived of the emotions invoked by music and visuals. Instead we end up with a work so technical it's sickening to read. Had the plot been the main problem, I would have overlooked it: we've all heard the same story told a thousand different ways by a thousand different authors. Eragon's plot was tolerable. My real gripe was with Paolini's style, or lack thereof.Paolini's prose could not hold my attention for longer than ten minutes at a time. Descriptions of people and places read like lists, as if the author felt obligated to say a certain amount about everything, no matter how uninteresting. And the dialog was so stilted that at times I had to set the book down and laugh. Unlike his purist predecessor Tolkien, Paolini shamelessly mixes old and new fashions of speech. Like a typical nerd, he randomly throws ten-dollar words into everyday conversations. Even when the characters are emotional, their feelings are described bluntly. It is obvious that Paolini tries to convey the beauty of love, sadness, and other emotions in much the same way that Tolkien did (\\"In my writing, I strive for a lyrical beauty somewhere between Tolkien at his best and Seamus Heaney's translation of Beowulf.\\" -C.P.), but he is far too technical to come close to capturing the essence of an emotion.I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this book to anyone other than the kind of fantasy-loving, anime-watching teenager who reads \\"when they make me in school\\".

And what was I missing! A great book by Paolini that transports you into a world of fantasy, magic and battle between good and evil. The plot will submerge you in the live of Eragon, a farm boy who became a Dragon Rider. Paolini gave very good explanations of Eragon's quest and the battle within himself. Always a good read , the book make the reader know and care for the character inmensly. And it isn't that what a book is supposed to do?

I think it is defiantly worth buying and reading. I was looking forward to seeing the movie, but when I heard that it was PG and only 1 1/2 hours long I douted that it would be worth seeing but I went ahead and saw it, and I have to say that I thought it was horrible and the book was much much better. It was like they took the book and shortened it A TON and also added horribly cheesy lines making the dialogue totally modern in a movie that is supposed to be medieval. Over all, the book is good and the movie is not."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Wow, this book has everything! A slight allusion to the big picture as a blue stone which contains an infant dragon is jettisoned from an elvish caravan pursued by the Empire. The caravan is destroyed, but the stone makes its way into an uninhabited region called the Spine. A farmboy named Eragon who lives on the outskirts of town stumbles on the stone, but he can't sell or trade it. He then finds out that the stone contains a dragon, and the Empire (Paolini uses the Empire!) is looking for it. Eragon hides his secret until the Empire destroys his farm and kills his family, then sets on a quest with a mysterious stranger, thought to be an old crazy stroyteller. The stranger (Brom) trains Eragon in sword play and gives him a sword once owned by the legendary Dragon Riders. As Eragon and Brom work their way around, we discover Brom has a secret \\"plan\\" for Eragon.What to expect from The Empire Strikes Eragon:1. Eragon is living with his uncle, has no recollection of his parents...therefore, Daddy could be Darth Dragon Rider2. Brom has a mysterious sword with no origin...could be Darth's sword before he turned to evil3. Eragon, don't kiss the princess, she may be your sister!!!I wasn't impressed with the writing style of this book. Motives (like when the dragon told Eragon it was mad at him for always getting himself into trouble), and writer's conveniences (despite dying arts and languages surrounding the Art of Dragon Riding, everyone Eragon meets can talk telepathically, and speaks old elvish) made it terribly obvious that we are dealing with a fifteen year old writer. And don't overestimate the fact that he got published at such a young age as any sort of measure of the novel's greatness. Check out the back cover: his parents owned the publishing company. If you're looking for a good Fantasy novel, try Lord of the Rings. If you want a good Fantasy novel for a younger crowd, consider Harry Potter or the Chronicles of Narnia. If you liked this story, climb out from under your rock and rent Star Wars.And Paolini, next time try logging every event of your next D&D; tournament and making that the story. It'd probably be more interesting and have more flow. And it'd be yours!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I had long talk with a friend about this book and we both came to the same conclusion - this is as formulaic as it gets, not all that creative in any sense, and yet you find yourself speeding through the book anyways. All of the predictable fantasy tropes are present - the young boy who knows nothing of the world, lives in an isolate portion of an empire, yet has a destiny to become great, is chased out of his home by evil powers, and soon becomes a great hero that is rejoiced throughout the land. This may as well have been a children's version of the first book in Robert Jordan's \\"Wheel of Time\\" series. Anyways, the book follows Eragon and his dragon Saphira as they navigate a war between two factions - The Empire and the Verdan.I do want to emphasize that it's a great book for younger readers and is the kind of thing that will hook twelve-year olds and capture their imagination. It will hopefully inspire them to try other fantasy series and hopefully branch out into other genres. But is Eragon \\"good\\"? Not so much...But it will still entertain and be a decent edition to the fantasy canon."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"One of my friends recommended this book, so I had high hopes for it. Alas, my hopes were dashed. This book blatantly rips off elements of other major fantasy stories--mainly Tolkien and Anne McCaffrey. A main character named Eragon who is a Dragon Rider that can communicate telepathically with his dragon. Gee, how original. And all the names are so unimaginative that I'm torn between laughing and crying at the travesty (a blue dragon named Saphira? Come on!). It's pretty much a cliched travelogue. Ugh. I'm rarely moved to write reviews but this book really just blew it. If you want some good fantasy, there's plenty of much better stuff out there--try some Robin McKinley, for instance."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This is definitely your average epic fantasy with powerful heroes, sinister villians, and large-scale battles. First, let me say that I enjoy these types of fiction, being a connoisseur of fantasy novels. I would and could enjoy this book, despite a major flaw: I hate the main character. If this guy went to my highschool, I would beat the crap out of him.I hate him for a couple of reasons. One is that he is too powerful. He's like Superman. Superman has laser eyes, x-ray eyes, freeze breath, flying abilities, super-strength, and a bad attitude. It is okay for him to be strong, but he must also have his weaknesses, otherwise the reader is not interested. When a protagonist has no weaknesses, how are we expected to be held in suspense? There is never any doubt that Eragon is in danger. Even Superman has Kryptonite, but Eragon eats Kryptonite for breakfast.Also, he is a jerk. He drags all his friends into his mindless quest and they all end up getting killed or imprisoned. He never recognizes their help nor does he really care that they are suffering. For example, when they are being chased by Urgals, Eragon decides to leave an unconscious elf and a friend of his (who has saved him countless times) to their Urgals because he wants to go fly around on his dragon. When Murtagh (the friend) points out the absurdity of this request, Eragon gets mad at him and calls him a jerk. How dumb is that? At that point, I was hoping Superman would come flying in a stop Eragon, but then again, Eragon would have probably broken him like a twig.The final reason that I hate him is that he learns so fast he's like some kind of human computer. I wouldn't be surprised if he had a disk-drive in the back of his head. Brom just pops in the disk about sword fighting or reading english or speaking Elven and then poof, Eragon is a master of it. This unbelievable mastery of these complex skills is beyond believable. I only wish I could learn my Spanish vocab words as quickly.So basically what I'm trying to say is this: the main character distracts from the reading experience and ruins the overall effect of the book."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Eragon by Christopher Paolini was, in my opinion, an artistic failure. To begin with, the plot is as follows, briefed, of course: A boy on the verge of growing into a man discovers something thing will forever change his life: a dragon. (Slight Spoilers) However, when he loses his uncle, our hero vowes to take up revenge. Assisting him is a shady storyteller who knows more than he reveals.Such a plot has been overdone, to put it nicely. Without any orignality, this book simply fails. The prose is not good (lots of telling, incorrect word usage, sentence blunders, uneeded descriptions, overdosed adverbs, and lack of reality). If this were Tolkien, I would have rethought even touching Fantasy ever again.It seems to me that those who read this book and enjoy it are teenagers who haven't tasted Fantasy, or if they have, it's been through video games and movies such as LOTR the movies and/or Final Fantasy. If you are included in that group, then by all means, you might just love this book and admire Mr. Paolini for doing what he did: creating an \\"epic\\".However, I don't find anything \\"epic\\". The world is dull and a complete rip from Tolkien, more so than any other Tolkenesque world I've run across. The storyline is straight from Star Wars, no denying it. The plot is linear, making me feel like the ripped-off world is really alive. While Eragon and Brom are off, I feel as if the entire world is just standing still, waiting to be graced by the presence of our hero(s).I'm troubled by the fact a literature teacher found this as excellent. Shakespeare and Homer lost their places in the classroom, perhaps?If you are a fan of fantasy and have been reading for many years, or even if you've just started and enjoy class literature, may I direct you to George Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire, R. S. Bakker's The Prince of Nothing, Steven Erikson's Malazan, the Fallen, Madaline Howard's The Hidden Stars, or (for those who like to be bold) Mervyn Peake's Gormenghast? Those series have brought me great pleasure. I'm sorry, Mr. Paolini, but I'll take either Tyrion, Steerpike, Frodo, Whiskeyjack, or Prince Raun over Eragon, book and character."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Here's an illustration of how bad this book is: while reading it, I used a page from a notebook as a bookmark. Every time I groaned, sniggered or rolled my eyes, I put a mark on the paper. The final tally? 149 marks. And I only started doing it about 1/3rd of the way in. That means that there were, at the very least, 149 moments which were either stupid, lame or risible.Having read it, though, I have to disagree with those who claim Paolini's technical writing is incredibly bad. Eragon is at least serviceably written (meaning that I generally knew what was going on and who everyone is - it's not as simple as it seems to do that, you know), but I found it very tedious to read. There was not a single idea, character or line of dialogue in this book which appeared to be original, and that's the killer. It's true that most fantasy consists of reusing the same basic ideas over and over again (this is one of the appeals of fantasy for some people), but the mark of a good writer is that he or she always presents the popular cliches in a new and interesting way, or inserts a few ideas of his or her own.Paolini, however, for all the hype about how fresh and tasty his writing allegedly is, either has no imagination at all or is simply failing to use it. There was absolutely nothing original or surprising in Eragon; every plot point was predictable, the characters were all one-dimensional archetypes, and the world was yet another faux-medieval snorefest.I usually don't place too much emphasis on originality, and nor am I much of a nitpicker. But I expect books to be entertaining, and this one wasn't. It was just... lame.I never once found myself caring a toss about any of the the characters, and in the case of the main character I kept hoping that he would come to a horrible end. Which is odd, since a supposedly reliable reviewer wrote the comment inside the book which claimed that Eragon, the main character, was 'likeable'.I'm sorry, but I don't find this whiny, self-righteous deadbeat to be even slightly likeable. Eragon has no dark side and nothing interesting to say, and keeps ordering people around and snapping at them for no reason. That's not to say that he isn't believable: I'm able to say truthfully that I knew many people like him in highschool. Unfortunately, I hated every last one of them. In Eragon's case, I kept wanting to give him a slap upside the head.In summary, this book is not so much bad as just flat and mediocre. In addition, the magical powers with which Eragon is blessed come along just when they're most convenient, so that he never has to struggle to do anything. Giving this aggravating, unlikeable character mighty superpowers only makes him more annoying. Yes, I admire Paolini's acheivement, but I don't admire the revolting cynicism of his publishers, who have chosen to use the gimmick of his young age as a way to sell a sub-par book. But, of course, making lots of money is what publishing is all about, right?PS: Mericle; it would seem that, in fact, Paolini's parents DID own the publishing company. That would explain why the book says 'first published by Paolini Press' just inside the cover. Maybe I'm reading too much into that, but it just might mean something."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I thought this story was going to be somewhat promising since the sales rank--but IT DEFINITELY WAS ALL HYPE.

Inexcusable and pathetic! The more you praise this worthless tripe folks the more of this is what your going to get.

Interestingly, the writer-written reviews are some of the angriest or most contemptuous. Why?Well, Chris Paolini couldn't tell you because he isn't a writer.Sure, any idiot can put words on a page, but that's not what writing is all about. CP has put words on pages - a lot of them - but he displays none of the passion of a true writer's heart.A novel is a very personal thing to its writer. The events in one are inspired by things the writer has really seen and done, the characters are fragments of the writer's personality expanded into full people. Essentially, a novel is a part of its creator's mind. This is why a lot of writers get so worked up about what they write.How do I know that CP is not a 'real' writer? Because his book has none of the hallmarks of a 'real' work. It has nothing original in it - no parts of the writer's mind have come through. The characters are too flat and undifferentiated to be parts of anyone's real personality. There is no distinctive 'voice' to the piece - virtually nothing about the writer's viewpoint can be discerned by reading it. Essentially, Eragon is one very long quotation of a book. The poor writing is merely a sign of the author's inexperience, but the unoriginality, which does indeed qualify as plagiarism, is what really damns this book. It is an empty, soulless, bland work, utterly devoid of any true passion or inspiration. All authors are passionate in some way, but this one has failed to properly apply his. If he has any, it's not in evidence here.Oscar Wilde once said; 'Most people are other people. Their thoughts are other people's thoughts, their lives are imitation, their passions a quotation', and the truth of that has never been as evident as it is here.CP did not write because he was driven to, as 'true' writers are, but 'chose' to write. This is why the prose in Eragon feels so false and why the character interations are forced and unrealistic. It reads as if the author learnt all his skills by reading Fantasy Writing for Dummies. By doing what he has done, he has made a mockery of what writers live for, and that is why so many are enraged by this book. They can spot the signs. And so, it would seem, have many other people, including plenty of non-writers. This book is a phony written by a phony, and does not deserve its sucess in the slightest."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I fail to see how anyone with half a mind could find the book Eragon enjoyable.

I warn people not to waste their time reading this book."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"What would you do if you were hunting in the woods and found a mysterious stone? Would you keep it? This is what happens to a poor farm boy named Eragon. When no one buys it, he tries to discover what it is hiding. A dragon hatches and Eragon names the baby dragon Saphira. Eragon decides to go and tell the town story teller, Brom, about him being a Dragon Rider. Little did Eragon know, the Empire is looking for Saphira's egg, they come to Eragon's town and people and so Eragon sets out with Brom. He faces many hardships along the way and discovers that he will have to fight Galbatorix one day. This book genre is fantasy. My favorite character in this book is Saphira. She is my favorite character because she protects Eragon and can use magic. I think that this book is fantastic and is a quick read, once you pick this book up you will not be able to put it down until you finish it.

I would also suggest that you read Eldest the sequel."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I am not a professional writer or critic by any means, but I was definately leary about continuing with a book that begins with such blatant references to Tolkien's 'Lord of the Rings' I nearly threw it aside disgusted (bow-legged creatures with black blood; a forest that people enter but never leave; the protagonist's name so close to Aragorn, etc.). But I continued on and was rewarded in the last 1/2 to 1/3 of the book.Finally, Paolini found his voice and was no longer the 15-yr-old writer, but a novelist. I found myself sneaking glimps during work and reading during my few breaks in the day, desperate to find out who Murtaugh was, what is Arya's connection to Eragon and many other questions. In retrospect the connections to Tolkien can be explained by anyone familiar with fantasy or early medieval works: black blood is evil, forests are unnerving and made more mysterious by the stories that surround them, etc. For the seasoned fantasy reader, this book probably isn't the best follow-up to 'LOTR', but I would whole-heartedly recommend this to younger readers, eager for a fantastical escape. In fact, I immediately placed this book on my 15-yr-old brother's bed the moment I finished, hoping he'll begin the adventure and eagerly await the sequel with me."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Trust me-this is a good book. Plenty of people gave this book 1 star. There were a bunch of reasons (none of which were very good). The most common one was that he copied others. I saw very little relationship between this book and Harry Potter OR Lord Of The Rings (the two most prominent ones). The problem with those \\"similar\\" books is that Saphira is there. You don't see Frondo (or Bilbo) walking around with a dragon following him. And Harry Potter really only focused on magic, there were almost no dragons, and the story was more \\"Action\\" than \\"Adventure\\" as compared to the very \\"Adventure-y\\" Eragon. As for the \\"female characters do nothing\\" thing come on!!! Arya was obviously much stronger than Eragon, even when she was poisoned AND in a trance she easily could have killed Eragon (when Eragon made contact with Arya's mind-page 338), even though the whole \\"rescue the beautiful woman\\" thing was kind of old the fact that the \\"beautiful woman\\" is more than capable of taking care of herself is something relativly new. For the \\"old plot\\" complaint: c'mon you read this book all in one sitting, didn't you (that was a statement). If you read ANY book all at once, especially as long a book as this one, you'll get bored no matter how good the book is. Try reading it one chapter at a time. Also, most fantasy-adventure books have the whole \\"long boring journey\\" thing. For all those people who gave this book a one (or a two): please, this book IS good.

Through the magic of the dragon Eragon and the dragon form a bond, a magical bond, a bond of the dragon and the dragon rider. Eragon keeps his dragon a secret but word gets out that Eragon has found a strange rock and two strangers come into Eragon's town, the Ra'zac, to get the egg. These two strangers turn out to be working for the king and destroy Eragon's house and kill his uncle in pursuit of the dragon egg. Before Eragon's house was destroyed Brom, the village storyteller, had discovered Eragon had a dragon. Eragon wants revenge on the two killers and sets off with Brom and his dragon, now named Saphira. Along their travels Eragon soon learns there is more to Brom then meets the eye when he gives Eragon a sword of a dragon rider, sword lessons, and lessons on how to use magic, an ability gained from the bond between him and Saphira.

The elves, Shades, Urgals and dragons weave together into a tapstry worthy of Tolkien.

He's always whining, getting knocked out, whining, getting beat up, whining, snapping at someone, whining. Poalini, we hate whimpy cry-babies! He becomes an expert swordsman in a few months? Trust me, all trhat can be learned in a few months are the basic moves, and there's a lot more to swordsmanship than the moves. It's clear that Poalini didn't study the subject before he wrote about it. In one sequence while he's fightin he's \\"combining different moves\\". You can't combine different sword moves, thats like combining walking and sitting.Of course he has to fall in love with the beeeeeautiful girl(why she likes him is beyond me.) I heard that the character Angela(why do the women have normal names?) was based on Paolini's sister. If I were her I'd sue him! Angela is the second stupidest Character in the book! The battle was completly undescribed. How does Saphira suddenly wind up surrounded by Urgals(don't even get me started on them) who are sticking her with spears piercing her armor which was supposed to be sooooo strong, and she can't fight back. And during the battle all Eregon seems to do is see his friends fighting. Arya, Eregon's love interest, was so over described that I got sick. She has long, flowing dark hair, slanted eybrows, a scar on the cheek (strangley enough like Liv Tyler in LOTR) Eregon has dark eyes and dark hair but thats all we know about him (a bit like Paolini, hmmm might have uncovered something there). Almost all the story lines were copied from something else. Here's something I can't figure out: Eragon's uncle gets killed, he rushes off to kill the Ringwraith-like killers. As soon as they encounter them Eragon decides not to kill them. Why?! As soon as they dissapear, he starts having dreams and visions about some girl who is in prison, and of course, he, Eragon,aka Superman, must rescue her even though she has absolutley nothing to do with anything except nothing! Then he decides he must go fight the evil king Galbatorix( sound's like a brand of cereal)who rules the land by not dong anything evil. Let me guess, he marries Arya and they becom the reluctant, wise, benevolent rulers. Oh please! Hmm, where have I heard that before? He would probably enact laws prohibiting use of the word \\"said\\" since Paolini seems to hate it. One more thing that annoyed me was the hunting scene at the beginning. Deer don't travel in large herds and all sleep together at night. Also Eregon misses his deer by \\" a hair's breadth. I still can't figure out what part of the deer he was aiming for. The vital parts of a deer are pretty hard to miss by a hair's breadth without still hitting the deer.

Let's see if any of this sounds familiar to you: Poor peasant boy finds dragon (and of COURSE he has to be the \\"right person\\" for the dragon to hatch for), discovers that he can do magic, turns out to be good at practically everything he does (i.e. swordfighting, magic, working with a dragon) goes on wonderful adventure to save the world and do the traditional fight of good vs. evil, and they all live happily ever after. How about THE GENERIC FANTASY PLOT! And the least this kid could do is try to make up some CREATIVE rip-off names. I mean, ARYA?? Hmmmm. That's a tough one. Let me think about this one for a minute. Beautiful, elfen princess, long dark hair, cheek scar, good fighter... hey... wait a second... this sounds like ARWEN! And the Urgals? Why doesn't he just call them \\"Orcs with horns\\"? I don't know about anybody else, but the whole scene where he defeats someone who is supposed to be one of the best swordfighters in the whole of \\"Alagaesia\\" is just plain stupid to me. And Christopher Paolini also needs to learn that it's okay to use \\"said\\" every once in a while. He probably has some talent buried under this mound of adverbs and over-descriptions, but he will probably need to wait several years for it to fully develop and grow into a book worth reading. Another problem I found with this book is Saphira's magical wisdom. She's matured incredibly over the course of a very short period of time, and talks like she's 300 or something. Also, at the end of nearly every chapter, Paolini uses the tired old cop-out ending of Eragon drifting into unconsciousness or sleep. It also seems that whenever Eragon is talking/trading insults/arguing with an enemy, he either \\"rebutts\\" or \\"retorts\\". I could go on for a great deal more, but I won't waste your time. Overall, this is a terrible book. Please do not read it if you can avoid it. I was forced to read it in Reading class, and suffered through the torture somehow, though I did enjoy the essay on the test that said, \\"Give your complete opinion of 'Eragon', with supporting details from the book.\\" Don't waste your time. Wait 20 or 30 years to see what Paolini can put out then, but don't bother now. Age is not an excuse for terrible quality."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"My recommendation for this book: stay away. My 12 year old son is a huge fantasy fan, so I bought this for him after hearing all the hype. He gave it back to me after reading about 100 pages and asked if it was too late to return it for our money back. I figured it couldn't be that bad, so I began reading iti myself. It is. This book is simply poorly written, horribly derivative of quite a few other fantasy titles (I used to read a lot of fantasy to my son when he was younger), and simply not a very good story. I'm glad so many other people seem to like it (although I'm stumped as to what they see in it). I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone however."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"As I read this, I was constantly shocked by the complete lack of originality of the book. It is one thing to be influenced by great fantasy writers, quite another to unabashedly lift ideas from them, as Paolini does. Many of the people praising him do so because they are caught up in the hype of his being a 15-year-old writer. I suggest they read Anne McCaffrey's books to see what a whopping amount of her dragon lore he has borrowed. For the source of his treatment of elves and dwarves, look no further than JRR Tolkien.Bottom line - disappointing for someone who is familiar with his sources, and is evaluating the book on its merits as a work of fantasy, not as 'a-work-of-fantasy-written-by-a-fifteen-year-old'. It might be 'original' for someone who is not."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"On the one hand, it's kind of neat seeing a teenager writing a book and getting it published. On the other hand, it's not \\"neat\\" if it's a BAD book originally published by the kid's PARENTS, for god's sake! I agree with most of the 1-star and 2-star reviewers here, and will not repeat their points about how derivative, formulaic, uncreative, and frankly, embarrassing this book is.I would just add that Eragon is an incredibly obvious -- and cynical -- attempt by Knopf to cash in on the Lord of the Rings phenomenon. Let's see, \\"Eragon\\"/\\"Aragorn\\", \\"The Spire\\"/\\"The Shire\\", a stone that can't be damaged when struck by a sword/a ring that can't be damaged when thrown in the fire or struck by a sword, elves/elves, dragons/dragons, etc. etc. Yawn.Unfortunately, Christopher Paolini is no JRR Tolkien, by any stretch of the imagination. In fact, Tokien is probably rolling over in his grave right about now. Still, I will be curious to see what, if anything Paolini comes up with in the future. Right now, I've got to say I am NOT optimistic."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Well, I would have liked to give the author a better rating, just because he young and all. But I have to at least want to finish a book in order to feel like giving it three stars. While reading Eragon, I kept feeling as if I was wading through the untried fantasies of an adolescent boy. Sorry, but I'm not enough of a voyeur to want to do that. I've read some very convincing fantasies, but this one didn't ever allow me to forget that I was reading. Little details were off -- things like when Eragon's legs are bleeding through his pants from sitting on dragon scales, but yet the pants never tore. . .that's one example of many. Details make a book, and careful attention to detail was missing here. Also, the characters didn't seem real. I've never been drawn to female characters who seemed to exist solely for the convenience of the male characters. The chemistry was lacking between people. I think this may be because the author, being a kid, never had to test his abstractions against reality. I don't hold that against him, because most kids haven't had to do that, and that's part of what makes them wonderful. But it did make me a little queasy to read Paolini's 'wise old' characters, who did not seem eotjer wise or old.I got this book because it was selected for a book discussion group I go to. Even so, I didn't actually finish it, and neither did a lot of the other members. Well, it's the holiday season and people are busy. We're all in our twenties, so maybe that's it, although we all enjoyed Harry. We concluded that Eragon is just one of those inexplicable fads that come over the masses now and then. I'm not even sure why I feel compelled to write this review--maybe just a bit of resentment for having shelled out the bucks to buy the book.I think that in another ten years, Paolini may be able to write something I'd want to read. But right now he's still finding his footing when it comes to writing. In a word: unconvincing."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I read the hyped up reviews and bought the book, but it's really your standard \\"sword & sorcery\\" epic. Great chunks of it are lifted from The Lord of the Rings--dwarves, elfs, a wise old wizard, a mysterious quest and so on. It's the same old drill.The lead character Eragon isn't remarkably likable, either. Seems to be self-righteous teenager. The book is fine as a diversion, but lacks the humor to make it anything out of the ordinary. It lacks the wit of Harry Potter, the mystery of The Da Vinci Code (great book!), or the true epic power of Rings trilogy. If you like this kind of banal quest fantasy, it's fine, but otherwise, look elsewhere."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"While normally I'm cautious about buying hardcovers, particularly by authors I'd never heard of before, seeing this book promoted so heavily in every bookstore I visited convinced me that the price would be worth the reading. I was wrong.Characterization in this book is unoriginal and sloppy, especially (and unfortunately) with regards to the main character. Christopher --oh, I'm sorry, I mean, Eragon -- initially has little or no personality, and is later prone to random and inexplicable bursts of anger or sadness. Not to attack the author (though I guess I am), but the main character seems to be nothing more but a teenager's projection of his omnipotent fantasy self. Lo! It's a strapping youth who is an expert hunter and must care for his family, who receives one of the last dragons in the land, who masters swordplay in a matter of days (a slight exaggeration, but only slight), who also happens to have a hidden, powerful spring of magic! There is nothing he cannot do!Plot is as unoriginal as the characters, with events proceeding in a single, orderly line so as not to distress the reader and help him or her to sleep more quickly. There are no surprises at all in the storyline - how does that old man know magic? Gasp! Really? Essentially every typical fantasy plot was thrown into a mixer and spit out onto the pages, making a very dull read.Finally, in response to a reviewer who said that they \\"have yet to actually read this book,\\" and seemed to have given it five stars simply because the author was young...frankly, that's a terrible reason to rate a book highly. There have been many young authors who actually wrote quality works, but this isn't one of them. I was disgusted to discover that this book's popularity mainly stems from the fact that his parent's owned a publishing company, and then heavily promoted this book.Some have said that reviewers who judged this work harshly are coming down on it too hard, since it was meant as a children's book. I say that children especially do not deserve poorly written and unoriginal stories."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"How this book ever got to be a bestseller is beyond me, as it's some of the poorest material I've ever read.- The plot is almost directly copied from the first \\"Star Wars\\" film, most of the names and settings are copied from \\"Lord of the Rings,\\" and the premise of Dragon Riders is lifted straight from Anne McCaffrey's \\"The Dragonriders of Pern\\" books. I'm surprised Lucas, McCaffrey and the estate of Tolkein don't sue Christopher Paolini for plagarisation.- Paolini's writing style leaves a LOT to be desired. He describes every single little detail of the landscape but doesn't bother to tell us what the main character looks like. He uses endless adverbs to tell us exactly how every line of dialogue is spoken (a prime example being \\"'Why?' enquired Eragon, quite curious\\"), and he never uses the word \\"said.\\" And despite his best efforts he violates the \\"show don't tell\\" rule.- I absolutely hate the main character. Eragon is a whiny, stuck-up brat who has an unbelievable ability to master anything within the space of a few days. And let's not forget the fact that he gets knocked out at the end of every other chapter.Something saddening about this book is the effect its success has had on Christopher Paolini. It's made him arrogant, conceited and pretentious. From reading the sequel to \\"Eragon\\" (the equally poor \\"Eldest\\"), from reading and listening to Paolini in interviews, or from simply looking at his picture, you can tell that he thinks he's the next Tolkein. And his pretentiousness is summed up perfectly in the now infamous quote from his website, \\"I strive for a lyrical beauty somewhere between Tolkein at his best and Seamus Heaney's translation of Beowulf.\\" It's saddening indeed that Paolini has allowed the success of his book to go to his head like this.Before I go, I have something else to say. Will people please stop using Paolini's age as an excuse to praise this book? For starters he isn't a child any more (he's 22), and though he started it when he was 15 he finished it when he was 19. I'll fold and admit that it's an achievement for a young person to write a 500 page book, but his age doesn't make it a good book by any means, and the only reason he got it published was because his parents own a publishing company!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Just a little note before the actual review: Every five-star review of eragon has either 2 out of 2 or 5 out of 5. I've read other 1-star reviews with zeros for helpful-ness. What, are eragon fans rating them? Look, these reviews are rated for if they prove valid points, not just because you like the book and they don't. And the review:Why don't we just start off with the characters. They're not very cool.We have Eragon, the main character. My first problem: his name. It's almost exactly like Aragorn. Oh no, that's right, Paolini named him this because it was one letter away from \\"dragon.\\" Yeah right. Why not name him \\"Cragon,\\" then? Isn't that one letter away from \\"Dragon?\\" Also, we do not receive a description of any of the characters except for Arya, some hot elf chick. Now why is that?Let's take a look at the facts: Arya is a beautiful elf princess that Eragon must rescue. Of course, he does. And everyone's thinking \\"Oh, that had me on the edge of my seat!\\" Look, you can go play Super Mario Bros. and find the exact same idea: Mario rescuing Princess Peach. Link rescuing Princess Zelda. It IS possible, you know, to have a good book without a damsel in distress. Look at King's The Dark Tower epic series: there's no one to rescue, but it's the best epic out there.Another arya complaint: Paolini makes her a weak character. He makes it so that she's beautiful, and nothing more. In one point of the book, Eragon literally REMOVES HER SHIRT to \\"heal\\" her back wounds. Hey there, buddy, can't you just, uh, use your magical powers to heal THROUGH the shirt? You are a magical hero rescuing a princess, aren't you? What? You say you can shoot fireballs just by saying \\"Brisingr???\\" WHAT??? You can create a scorching fire shockwave with a SINGLE ARROW??? I must say, Eragon, you are quite a strange fellow; first, you can burn three \\"urgals\\" (creatures inspired from orcs in LOTR) with a single arrow, yet you MUST take off her shirt while she's sleeping in an unconscious state to use healing magic...Wait a minute, what's that, ERAGON??? You say you can also speak to a dragon using telepathy? You are a DRAGON RIDER??? Hmm, Eragon, you sure that wasn't already done in Anne McCaffery's The Dragon Riders of Pern series?Wait, so lemme get this straight...you are a farmboy. Your uncle and home burn because of the evil emperor. *Eragon nods* An old man comes and teaches you the magical arts *Nods*...and the old man dies by the hands of the empire? *Nods* But, Eragon, ole chap, that already happened in Star Wars...you can't just do that again, wait, WHAT?!!! You say you CAN because your author's parents have their own publishing company, and that they published it THEMSELVES??? Well, I guess that just makes it all better, doesn't it, then?Eragon, wait a minute, slow down--you say you met another weak female character??? *Eragon talks* Oh, yes, I agree, Eragon, Hermione from the Harry Potter series is a much stronger female character than Angela in Eragon.*END OF MONOLOGUE*As you can see, everyone, where Paolini gets his ideas from. What's worse: all the similar words from Eragon. Let's see...Isenstar? But, I coulda sworn there was a place called \\"Isengard\\" in LOTR...Ardwen??? But, wasn't there an elf named \\"Arwen\\" in LOTR??? Wow, now THAT'S what I call original!Wait, wait a minute, folks, Eragon's got something to say. What, Eragon? You say there are dwarves and elves in Paolini's novel? Ya don't say! There were dwarves and elves in LOTR as well, if I'm not mistaken! Wait, there's a place called Eoam in your word? Wow, now, you see here, Eragon, you know the Rohan Riders from LOTR? *Eragon nods* Well, one of them is named \\"Eomer.\\"Wait, Eragon, tell me I did NOT just hear you say that there are creatures called \\"Kull\\" in your world; you say they are stronger forms of \\"urgals?\\" But, isn't that the same concept of Uruk-hai in LOTR? You say it is? Well, why hasn't anyone told ole Paolini about this mistake? You say because he was so young when he started writing this, and that people wanted to give him a chance? Well, that doesn't make it better or worse, now does it? *Eragon shakes his head* I didn't think so, Eragon ole buddy.Everyone, Eragon has one final thing to say: he recommends that you buy and read Rowling's Harry Potter series and King's The Dark Tower.Ladies and Gentlemen, this has been Eragon, giving a bad review of his own book! *Cheers from the audience. Eragon bows.*"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"On the off chance the reader of this review has not read/watched Eragon, I will refrain from plotspoiling.What's it about?: A young man named Eragon is hunting in the mysterious mountain range fearfully known as The Spine when he finds a mysterious blue stone. He takes it home and plans to barter it, but when it hatches into a dragon, Eragon is thrown into a world of swordplay and magic. He struggles to discover his past while surviving long enough to have a future.What's good about it?: It has a pretty good plotline, with some cliches, but also some original, intriguing ideas. There are some awesome characters that you really grow to know and love. (Murtagh and Saphira are my favorites) Christopher Paolini includes several languages- the ancient language, the dwarf language, and the urgal language. I always thought that was really neat. Also, on that note, there are many interesting creatures in his world - the usual dwarves, elves, dragons and humans, but also urgals, raz'zak and letherblaka.What's not so good about it?: It *is* a little cliche in parts - it kind of reminds me of Harry Potter, Star Wars, and Lord of the Rings rolled into one. But sometimes that's a good thing! It depends on what you like. Also, sometimes Eragon is frustratingly stupid, and you kind of want to smack him upside the head, but unfortunately can't.I already saw the movie, why should I read the book?: The movie didn't follow the plotline too well, and the book is a lot more interesting. Just give it a chance!So would you recommend it?: Yes! It's great for anyone who loves books about fantasy, dragons, swordplay, magic, dumb human boys being spurned by elf women, etc.If you haven't read Eragon, now would be a good time!

It does a great job of filling that gap where Harry Potter used to sit :o)The story is about a boy named Eragon who finds a stone which turns out to be an egg. After it hatches, Eragon learns that it's a dragon, and raises it. All the while, an evil dragon rider and self-proclaimed king, Galbatorix, is on the hunt for the missing dragon. Eragon's home and family are destroyed by the king's spies, the Ra'zac. Brom, the local storyteller, finds Eragon and explains to him what a dragon rider is. The Varden, a ersistance group, has been waiting for a new rider to appear to defeat Galbatorix. On their journey to find the Vardon, Brom teaches Eragon about the riders.This book is the first of four installments, and is full of interesting characters and sword-weilding action. I love the characters, and the creativity of the story. It's got all of the classic elements: farm boy turned hero, romance, adventure, villains, and sidekicks. Chris Paolini is an imaginative writer with impressive skills, considering he started writing this when he was 15.

There is so much information that I often find it difficult to follow along and keep it all straight. That will not however keep me from reading the other books in the series.

I had to \\"read for myself\\" and see why he liked the book so much.With regards to content, the book is written at a level that younger readers can understand and that older readers can fly through. It is a fast-paced story about Eragon, a young boy who has never known his father or mother, and the tumultuous journey he faces after discovering a polished blue stone in the nearby forest. The story involves a young boy on a quest, a wise old \\"storyteller,\\" the land of Alagaesia, the epic battle between good and evil, growing up, mythical creatures, elves, dwarves, and much, much more.I have seen quite a few negative reviews on this book, mostly written by published or aspiring fiction/fantasy authors. I feel that there are other authors who have mastered this genre in a way more suitable for older readers, but for younger readers, Christopher Paolini's books are perfect. I would recommend this book and the other books in the series for young readers who may or may not need encouragement to get reading.If you are an aspiring fantasy author or have read almost all fantasy books, I feel that this book would not \\"live up to the hype.\\"Personally, I enjoyed this book. It was a quick read and got me interested in reading more fantasy novels."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Eragon was a very enjoyable book, with its gripping storyline and characters, complexity, and fantastic elements. There were some clich&eacute;s and character development problems, among other things, that did hamper the book a bit. Does this stop you from enjoying the book? It didn't stop me. I very much enjoyed this book, staying up to the late hours to read it all.In spite of the occasional unoriginality, there are some definitely original concepts that I enjoyed, such as Seithr Oil. Nice tidbits. Overall, less original than I would like, but no more derivative than most fantasy these days. It certainly isn't any worse than the \\"Sword of Truth\\" or the \\"Sword of Shannara.\\"The fantasy cartography and world building was very good, not perfect, but very good. The map of Alagaesia looks real and authentic, and the author does an excellent job of showing the landmarks and describing them as his characters move across the land. The only flaw in the world building was that the Empire was somewhat empty; I wanted to see more major cities, towns, villages, landmarks, etc. As good as it was, it just wasn't enough.The characters were also good. Though most of them are obviously inspired by those from Star Wars or Lord of the Rings, they showed some interesting traits and definitely held my attention. Some characters, however, like Saphira, Eragon, or Arya, were poorly developed and Mary-Suish. Females are generally bitchy, with few other personality traits. Eragon and Arya had way too many achievements heaped upon them.The main character was not the best hero the author could have chosen. The least he could have done was give several other characters the opportunity to show the audience the world through their eyes. Eragon was not a particularly enjoyable character, and he had way too much of the book to himself.There are also some character development issues for me. What was most annoying was how quickly Saphira--who is less than a year old--becomes \\"wise\\" and starts giving Eragon advise.(She should have been young and naive!) Also, the main character learns to read and fight with swords far too quickly. I remember learning to read myself, during a more appropriate age for learning, and I sure as heck didn't learn to in a week! And there is no friggin' way anyone, no matter their innate talent, can become a master of the blade in four months.The storyline was what really held my attention. The action--though it takes place from only one POV--was intense and addicting. I could read this material for hours without getting tired of it, and the depth and complexity of the world seemed to highlight this.One of the best parts about the plot is that it is a very human story: There is no Dark Lord trying to take over the world or destroy it, like in, say, Sword of Truth. The storyline basically boils down to a dispute over who should rule the Empire, a war between different races and species, and a rebellion against an Empire, which are all things that happen in real life. Though the author's detractors will be happy to tell you that the villain is just a bad guy who's evil just because he has to be, I actually found myself sympathizing with the main villain more so than the hero, despite that he doesn't appear in the actual story.However, there were definitely things I would change if I were the author. The main hero is way too important. It would have been nice if some of the incredible feats he does, such as saving Arya and slaying Durza, had been transfered to another character, like say, Murtagh, who was much more mature and realistic than Eragon.On the whole, Eragon is a very good book that I highly recommend. However, it is held back by a weak protagonist and some mistakes in the plot. If you really hate traditional fantasy with farm-boys turned heroes and wise old mentors, you may want to read something else. Otherwise, it's hard to go wrong with the Inheritance Cycle."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Mix together equal parts \\"Star Wars\\" and J.R.R. Tolkien, then add a generous helping of Anne McCaffrey's dragon-riders and a few random shreds of Garth Nix for good measure.Obviously originality is not Christopher Paolini's strong suit, and it shows in his fantasy debut \\"Eragon,\\" which was penned in his tender teenage years. It swims in fantasy cliches and stilted dialogue, but there's a certain awkward charm in Paolini's fantasy world. The biggest problem is, simply put, Paolini's cardboard cutout of a self-insert hero, Eragon.The titular character is lucky enough to stumble across a strange blue stone while hunting on the Spine. After failing to sell it, Eragon finds that it's actually a dragon egg, and the baby blue dragon inside selects him to hatch for and remain with forever. All the Dragon Riders were killed off by Evil King Galbatorix long ago, except for the weird old recluse Brom, who becomes Eragon's mentor.And Luke, I am your father... wait, wrong story.When Galbatorix's men destroy Eragon's home and family, Brom and Eragon flee to find the mysterious rebels known as the Varden. But Eragon's dreams are being haunted by the beautiful elf Arya, and the little band sets out to save her. Eragon and his dragon Saphira learn many things -- and make new allies -- the journey to the Varden brings them a terrible (and totally predictable) loss, and leads them to Eragon's first battle.Lofty elves, humble farm boys, ghastly goblinesque creatures, mystical women, special swords, evil tyrants who are evil because they just are, evil minions, wise mentors, and telepathic dragons in a variety of colors. Christopher Paolini never met a fantasy cliche that he didn't like. And as a result, \\"Eragon\\" is dripping with Tolkien and Lucas-style trappings, right down to the hero's suspiciously Tolkienian name.Paolini paints these typical sword-and-sorcery stories with rather stilted but promising prose. \\"Eragon\\" has some raw rookie potential, and you can detect Paolini's enthusiasm as he explores his invented fantasy land, much the way many other teenagers have done after reading high fantasy and yearning to explore their own made-up worlds. There's just not much that is new or unique about this story, although Paolini throws in some attempted humorous quirks like a weird fortune-teller.The biggest problem with Paolini's writing is that Eragon is portrayed as a noble, brave, compassionate soul with a brilliant destiny ahead of him. Well, frankly he shows no nobility, bravery or compassion, and the many characters who gasp in admiration of him does not make him any more impressive. He's a glaring self-insert, with all the dimension of a cardboard standee, and about as sendearing.The supporting characters are not much better -- Brom is too brief a character to make much of an impact, and he seems to exist mainly to get Our Hero up to snuff in information and ability. And the love interest Arya is glorified only for her otherworldly beauty... which is all she has. Eragon's adoration of her seems unfounded, because er personality is chilly at best, snotty and autocratic at worst.Christopher Paolini's \\"Eragon\\" is pretty much what you'd expect of a teenage boy's fantasy novel -- plenty of Lucas and Tolkien echoes, and a style that hasn't yet gained a sense of humor about itself."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"A few years ago, when I was eleven, I had begun to write my own book.

To work on a story you must have the dedication, the talent, the hard working mind and room for improvement. Seeing as this is Mr. Paolini's first book, I aplaud his effort. I am only fourteen myself and I am already passionatly working towards the high up goal being held as a good and solid author. And ERAGON is a good place for Mr. Paolini to start his career and start on the road of improvement. The story is of a boy and his dragon and the adventures he goes on and the challenges he faces. He has a mysterius past and a very vague future which keeps the reader hooked. I personally like those types of stories. It may seem like a typical fantasy, but all fantasies have a general guidline anyway. He has started his way up the ladder of great writers and authors alike and I admire him. For me, Paolini is what I hope to be in a few more years, a writer that is well known in many places. When I first read the About the Author page I said \\"Wow, he wasn't much older than I was I when I started writing my book. That inspired me and made me continnue my long dream of becoming a writer. And if you don't believe me, try writing a two hundred page fanstasy novel right now and see how hard it is. Fanstasy takes plenty of dedication, if not more than most books do. So, go read the book, then comment on it. Use the phrase \\"assume\\" to catch my drift, if you haven't read it and are making preconceived obnoxious commentary. Writing isn't easy, and this is an amazing effort.Ok, more on the story, Eragon is not like the other fantasy characters who have everyone on their side, and have a \\"good\\" and \\"evil\\" face off. Not here. This book is the way the real world works, when you can't always tell when someone you love may betray or die on you at any moment. Or when you may be faced with mental, physical, and soul deep conflicts all at once. That's Eragon, and it's only the start, the book only starts to get harsh on Eragon and his dragon, Saphira, because of many deep scars, that aren't just his alone. Soon his next task is... (Please read the book).This book is a great book for Redwall, LOTR, HARRY POTTER and all fantasy fans all over the world. If you have a good repsect for fantasy and love those kinds of books then read this. ERAGON has received the baton of fantasy writers from the best of the best. He is now running to the finsh and to an excellent career. TWO THUMBS UP!!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This is not a great book, but it is easy to read, fun, and hard to put down. Those looking for complicated story lines, a highly evolved fantasy world, or complex chartacters will be somewhat dissapointed, but those looking for a simple, fun fantasy will enjoy this book.I'm hoping for a bit more depth in the next book, which I plan on buying."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"My first thought was how close to Lord of the Rings this was. I did enjoy the concept of the story but thought it could have been more original. Eragon (Aragorn?) to close. It was as if I were reading a distortion of LOTR, Dragon Riders of Pern, and Star Wars. I will read Eldest because I adore Saphira. She was what kept me going through it all."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This book was all very good to start with but then the main character, Eragon, and his dragon go out to kill someone. Thats not what i like. Near the end there is also a lot of fighting. I didnt like that so much. I will still read the second one to see if it gets any better..."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This was one of the worst books I have ever read. The plot was quite interesting, but the way it was wrtitten was horrible. It dragged on and on about unimportant topics and was extremely boring. The action started around the two hundreth page. I would definitly not recomend this book."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"The trouble with the fantasy space is that the best major elements (elves, dragons, magic swords, evil insane despots..) are pretty high-mileage. The best judgement of a new author in the genre isn't \\"what does he do that's brand new\\" (plenty of Baaaad books that innovate for the sake of originality) but how he weaves these familiar elements in new ways.Paolini takes familiar themes and builds them, albeit a bit slowly at first, into a compelling read. Unlike many books ostensibly about dragons, this one really is about a dragon and its rider, who is the first to return of a lost breed of heros.For those who can look beyond superficial comparisons, the differences in themes are clear. Elves are not the lost, weak, faded creatures of Tolkien but major (albeit recluse) forces of the world. Dwarves have wrought marvels in the past and (some) actively contribute to the wellbeing of the races, rather then fondling their gold and crying into their beer over legends gone.And the main character doesn't cry any more than you or I would if we were plucked by fate from our normal, sheltered world, and forced to grapple with global forces and destinies. He is a bit slow on the uptake, I'll grant you, but he's learning...The book is no wheel of time or LOTR saga (yet) but it's a good pace beyond the one-shot knockoffs that litter the fantasy shelves. Paolini is an author enjoyable to read, and worth watching."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"If you have read J.R.R. Tolkien's 'The Lord of the Rings' and seen 'Star Wars: A New Hope', don't bother reading this book.It seems that this 'author' has structured his story on Chapter four of the Star Wars series: A princess (noble elven woman) loses a very important object while being attacked by agents of an evil Empire. The important thingy is found by a young boy living on a farm with his uncle (who are his parents?). Later, the boy discovers he has a mysterious power that he inherited from a thought-to-be-extinct mystical, warrior clan. His uncle is killed by agents of the Empire looking for the important thingy and the farm boy vows revenge. The farm boy luckily is aided by a wise, old man who also has the mystical power. The old man gives the boy a powerful sword, aids the boy in sword combat and in using his mystical power. Sound familiar? And sprinkle in a little 'Tolkien' and his literary children, Terry Brooks, Robert Jordan, etc. and you have 'Eragon'.Not only is 'Eragon' nothing new in the realm of fantasy but it isn't even well written. 'Eragon' is quite simply, well, simple. First of all, the characters all sound the same as if they all had the same educational backgound and experiences. The writing is journalistic, meaning that there is a lot of description of objects and actions a la Role Playing Game Speak with little atmosphere or suggestion, basicaly this is REPORTING, NOT STORY TELLING. And finally, this book is not F-U-N to read, like the Harry Potter series. This book has no life of its own, no heart at all. The writing is simple enough for a child to read but the subject matter is actually kinda bleak, and even nihilistic (death and revenge, death and revenge, speared, dead babies oh my!). Who is the target audience? Perhaps if you are a male, high-school student, role-player, with a dark streak and will read ANY fantasy novel you can get your hands on, this book is for you.Note: If you are a parent, please do not dumb-down your child by having them read this book. There are plenty of classics out there."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I'm not sure why this novel is getting so much attention. Probably because the author is so young. He obviously has writing talent, but it is still raw, and I expect (hope) we will see better writing from him in years to come. In the meantime, Eragon is a humdrum rehash of characters and plot lines we have seen before. And there is surprisingly little action. The majority of the book is a travel log--they're chasing something or running from something, the horses are tired, they make camp. Again. And again. And again. Occasionally something interesting happens. The author has a nice descriptive voice, but at times he tries too hard. He overdescribed settings to the point that it is actually hard to visualize them. (The reader doesn't need to know exact heights, right turns, left turns, etc. Too confusing.) That said, I still give it three stars because I kept reading and kept wondering what would happen and intend to read the next book in the series. I admire the author's natural talent and look forward to his more mature work."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I recieved this book for Christmas after hearing a lot about it's 19 year old author. I originally thought wow, a nineteen yearold writing fantasy awesome, but then I started reading it. WOW this is a piece of crap. I'm going to assume that Chris has read a lot of fantasy, and because of this has been influenced by the books that he has read to the point that he is lacking any original thoughts at all. The only reason I'm giving this book two stars is because he is 19 and he needs props for getting a book published (even if his family oned the publishing company) when he is so young."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Before I begin, I have to give a nod to the author who, after all, is only 19 years old. If any of my students wrote this well, I'd be very impressed. That said, I still don't think young Paolini is anywhere near ready for publishing, and I'm frankly a little confused as to both how and why this book was accepted and marketed so lavishly.The plot line is predictable, the diaglogue trite, and the writing style very clearly that of a beginner. I read to page 200, hoping and hoping that something would happen to justify the glowing reviews featured on the dust cover. Unfortunately, nothing did, and I just can't make myself go on. This book may interest very young teens (although in our post-Harry Potter world, perhaps not), but otherwise, I would caution against wasting either the money or the time."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I am almost finished with the first book and can't wait to get to the next book. Can't beleive the auther started at age 15 with this book. Look forward to many years of good reading from Christopher Paolini."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"It's funny to me how much flak fantasy authors today have to take for not being Tolkien. The fantasy genre did not begin or end with LOTR, my friends. The fact that Paolini borrows liberally from the stories of those who have come before should not be held against him. Especially since his precocious use of language is eminently more readable than any of Tolkien's precious, biblical-style tomes.My only complaint with this rather engaging story is that it seems to meander somewhat in its ultimate goal. One moment, our young hero is running away. Then he is chasing after. Then he is running away again. Then he takes what amounts to a side quest... And then he is running away again. Mostly, this book focuses on the tutleage of young Eragon and his learning of magic, all of which I expect will pay great dividends in future volumes.Is this book so good that it deserves to have sold a million more copies than so many other fantasies out there? Not in my opinion. But nor is this a forum for sour grapes. The story is entertaining, and does what any first fantasy should do: establish the world and those who inhabit it. I imagine that in Book 2: Eldest, young Eragon will hit the ground running, and I for one am looking forward to seeing where his travels take him."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This was a wonderful book that had all that a person could want in a fantasy book. A dragon and aboy on a great adventure. Best book I have read in a long time."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I was very disappointed in the very blatant way the author copies his characters and plot from Tolkien's LOTR series. Even the characters have similar names. (ex: an Arwen the elf look-alike named Arya)He made very little effort to create an original plot, and many locations and characters have names/subplots/personalities that are so similar to their Tolkien counterpart that it is borderline ridiculous.I predict that the mentor of the main character that died, the Gandalf clone, will suddenly be resurrected in book two, ala' LOTR. I also predict the appearance of a talking tree, perhaps with a similar name to it's LOTR counterpart.We have an Arwen the elf character. (the elves even come from across the sea in this book)We have a Gimli the dwarf character, as well as the underground city of the dwarves.We of course have the Orcs (called Urgals in this book)as well as \\"super-orcs\\" called Kull (Ura-kai)There's Brom, Gandalf the wizard's cloneThere's even an Aragorn persona, who, like Aragorn, also happens to be the son of a mighty father who is fleeing his destiny.And we even have the evil magical tyrant, just like Sauron!This being said, the book itself is entertaining, especially if you haven't read anything by Tolkien. But let's face it, most people who would read this sort of fantasy genre have read LOTR, or at very least, have seen the movies.You can do better than this, Christopher Paolini! I expect better from you- you have the talent, now the rest is up to you!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"The fact that this author is young does IS amazing, however the literary work is not so impressive. Yes, it is in-depth and has the normal twists and turns of fantasy books, but it lacks the craftsmanship of better writers. I believe this author has not yet acheived the ability to create 'atmosphere' liek many others have been able to. If you are interested in a hard-core fantasy series, Robert Jordan's 'Wheel of Time' is a great one to start in. With over 9 books, its completely comprehensive; the first books being easy enought o read for all people, and the latter ones being rediculously awesome and complex. A must read."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"With Eragon, Christopher Paolini has attempted to write the next great epic fantasy of our time. He's taken all the usual ingredients; dragons, elves, dwarves, evil spirits who can't bear daylight, a fantastical new world, a wise, mysterious guide, and a young boy with a mysterious heritage, and mashed them together into a 500+ page novel. But in the end, Eragon is like so many other Tolkien-esque epic fantasies: all epic, and no magic. The story dragged on, and even when I skimmed whole chapters I couldn't make myself sit all the way through it. I've tried to read it twice now, and I've given up both times.Paolini's prose and plot aren't rotten; they just failed to grab my attention. If you haven't read a lot of epic fantasy, you'll probably like this. But for those of us who have ... this is pretty much a \\"been there, done that,\\" kind of story. There is nothing new under the sun, but most authors can put a twist on the same old devices and make them seem new. Paolini didn't."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Eragon is by far perhaps one of the best and most riveting and interesting books i have ever read. My friend urged me to read it, and finally i took her advice and i am thrilled that i did.The characters and events are linked together in such a way that lulls the reader into the story, with such accurate descriptionws you feel as if you are actually in the story. The second i picked up this book, i was hooked and spent the entire day doing nothing, but sitting on the couch reading until i finished it.Some people have been complaining about Eragon being too closely related to lord of the rings, but i think these people are sorely mistaken. Yes, Eragon does have elves being tall and majestic and wise/powerful, and dwarfs being short and stout adn digging holes just like Lord Of the Rings, btu do you really think tolkein made up all of those things himself? No, im sure that Tolkein got influences for his book from other books written before him, so why are people assuming that eragon just copies from lord of the rings.Here's a few examples of remarks made that i want to set straight1. Eragon has nothing to do with Aragon, so forget that. If you replace the \\"E\\" in Eragon with a \\"D\\" you will spell Dragon. Very smart and creative.2. Just because Arya and Arwen are elves and have dark colored hair does not make Arya a copy-cat of Arwen. It's like writing a book where the heroine's a blong girl who's smart, and having people say that you must be copying from Legally Blond. One word- REDICULOUS!!!!!!3. za-rac and Urgals have nothing to do with the uruk-hai and black riders, they're very original and i don't see why people are comparing them.4. I also don't understand why people are saying that Paolini copied from Mccaphrey. The animal connection theme has been done in hundreds/thousands of books since the beginning of time, and just because he chose a dragon to connect with the person doesn't mean he's copying. Also he's not copying when he says that dragons were identified by color. OMG how dare they be identified by color like everything else in life, red phone or blue phone, black cat or white cat, e.t.c. ( duh people).5. My last comment is that just because the names of places are similar doesn't mean he's copying, he simply used names that were similar. There are so many names in the world that similarities dohappen, i don't see how we can penalize him for this.Chris Paolini did an amzing thing when he wrote this book, by introducing the world to a new series of fantasy. I am sorry that other people seem to be afraid of his potential as a writer and must degrade him by saying that he copied his whole book from other well-known works of writing. Why is it that when someone with amazing potential comes forth, people are always so determined to put them down? I don't know but i do know that this is one of the best books that i have ever read, and i would recommend it to anyone who loves fantasy and adventure.

I must say I felt empathy, rather than contempt, for the villain, and hope the title character finds a way to understand the poor man.)Overall, great book, with one minor flaw.________________________*First favorite is Pullman's Dark Materials, second is Williams's Dragonbone Chair."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Young Mr. Paolini has a bright future as a writer should he decide to take some formal instruction. While he is obviously blessed with a fertile imagination his prose are weak and descriptions need work. I am more surprised at a publisher such as Knopf for editing the work in this fashion and question whether this was a marketing experiment geared at young readers. Nonetheless, it should not be compared to the writing prowess of authors such as Rowlings or Dhal. It is just another episode of a Hercules-like adventure. A lot of fun, but I dare to see him study at college, then read him when he has a greater command of writing. Goodluck."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"ERAGON (the main character) combines the elves, dwarves, and magic we expect with (just one) brilliant blue dragon, and a wide assortment of fascinating, mysterious, and believable characters.

In Eragon, the magic is the flow of events, as magic dramatically tires the user, possibly to death, an unusual and extraordinary limit forcing magicians to use care and judgement!This is the first book I have read TWICE in less than two weeks! It did however, have two disappointments -- on page 464, IT's OVER! and on p. 465, we find it's not over, but we do not know when the next segment (ELDEST) of this planned trilogy will arrive!

And it's no big deal anyway.Not to say I didn't despise Eragon, he reminded me of things like rocks, acorns, and single celled, perfect, not and evil bone in his body, way to many talents, complaining, quick-healing, not a single true challenge, similar to author, organism.If your the kind of person that doesn't mind the melodrama and redoing what's been done before, go ahead and buy the paperback, not the hardcover.

Though some say she was unnaturally wise, she was actually supposed to be very old, having waited to hatch out of her egg until the right person came along.

I have to say that this was a fantastic read. I am a little weary about people comparing it to Harry Potter or Lord of The Rings; both books were excellent in their own right. This book does stand on its own however. The story of young eragon becoming a hero is classic. Like Harry and Frodo, Eragon is a reluctant hero, thrust into a world that is both exciting and very dangerous, with many people who want to destroy him. I thought that there were too many plot points that were left unfinished though, which was the only reason I did not give it 5 stars. The battle at the end was fantastic, but it did not feel like an ending to a book should be. I know that this is part of a trilogy, but each book should stand on its own, like Harry Potter does. I still do not have a grasp on who exactly are the bad guys and who are the good guys. However this is a trivial complaint, the book is a fantastic read.

I loved the many different depictions of the characetrs Paolini painted in my mind. Paolini pays attention to small details in his book, like an artist would as he paints his greatest masterpiece. In my opinion, Paoilini has conquered a feat that most young adults only dream of.Being as his family was destitute and in need of food, young Eragon travels to The Spine in which even the most brave of souls dare not go. While Eragon is stalking his prey, he stumbles upon a mystical and spectacular sapphire stone or what he believes is a stone. The stone arouses his attention and he is mystified by it's presence. From this point on I was captivated by the fast moving pace and occurance of adventures he was about to embark on.This text seems to be influenced by other great works such as, Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings. As in these books Paolini has created many characters, lands, creatures. At first it was hard to keep them all straight. But, the author provides maps, pronunciation of the names, the Ancient Language, the Dwarf Language, the Urgal Language and it made it easier to comprehend.Eragon and Saphira grow to understand and respect one another as they encounter battles, serious injuries,imprisonment and freedom together.

Even though Paolini was inspired at 15 for this book, his inspiration was more plagiarism than fresh, new ideas. Childish and meaningless character and scene discription with dull, all-the-same dialogue dragged the book from page 2.If it's ever a movie, the film will be six hours of nothing. I mean, he's not even a qualified high-schooler, and apparently copied fantasy genuises like J.R.R. Tolkien, J.K. Rowling, and the makers of Star Wars. Even elements of Shakespeare are sprinkled within the pages. I can't believe the hype! The only reason he's a big-shot is because he was a teen author.There are much better teen fantasy (and other genres) writers out there waiting to be discovered, but are overrun but authors like Paolini, whose parents publish his books. Don't waste your time on this young boy.Sorry, Eragon, but I'm sticking with Harry Potter, Merry and Pippin, and Anakin SkyWalker."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"It's sad that so much of the hullabaloo over this book comes from the fact that the author was a teenager when he wrote it. That's all well and good and impressive, but that does not mean the book is super. I'm sorry, but when I read it, I did not think about how old the author was and take that into consideration.The fact is that this is a so-so fantasy that follows the lines of so many other so-so fantasies without doing anything the least bit original.The characters are flat, the pacing is horrid, and someone needed to rip the thesaurus from little Paolini's hands. No one needs that many adjectives per sentence!Painfully generic and nothing at all special."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"A hero's quest, a young boy on the verge of adulthood, an innocent who is more than he appears, Eragon is a story of all those things and more. Eragon is a young boy being raised by his uncle and aunt who took him in after his mother and father died. They are a poor family struggling to make ends meet. When Eragon finds a blue stone, all of his thoughts go to selling it for food. What he doesn't know is Arya sent the stone, which is actually a dragon's egg, to Brom, one of the last Riders for protection. The dragon only hatches for the person who will be its partner, and when Eragon finds it, the dragon chooses him. So starts a tale of adventure, mystery and suspense. There are battles, travels through dangerous and fascinating lands, misery and triumphs. All the while Eragon grows into the young man that was his destiny to become. Along the way he learns about friendship, perseverance, challenges, and the classic good verses evil. There are many threads left hanging at the end of the book. The book is long, but only finishes a few of the story lines created by the author. It would be a great tale for students who are done with all the Harry Potter books, and ready to take on another series. I feel bound to find the next book myself! From this series, students can continue on with Terry Brooks, Robert Jordan, Terry Goodkind, Orson Scott Card, and of course, J.R. Tolkin."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Christopher Paolini, Eragon (Knopf, 2003)Okay, I admit it, I've fallen into the same trap everyone else is; I gave this book a lot of latitude given the age and inexperience of its author. Were this written by an adult who'd published a few books (or even, most likely, a first-time author over the age of 21), I'd have probably read through it criticizing far more than I actually did. Instead, I kept saying \\"man, this kid was fifteen when he wrote this stuff?\\"That said, I do believe the one criticism I've seen levelled at this book more than any other-- that it's a ripoff of Tolkein that has dragons thrown into the mix-- seems to be being advanced by those who have read no more of epic fantasy than Tolkein and Paolini. Folks, everything that's come since has ripped off Tolkein and thrown dragons into the mix, with a few quite notable exceptions. An orc is an orc is an orc, and it doesn't matter what you call it, it's still an orc, a half-bestial adversary who's a lot stronger than the average human being, and masses of them stand between the intrepid hero and his far-off goal. Yes, Tolkein uses the conceit, and so does Paolini. And so have hundreds, if not thousands, of other fantasy authors in the intervening half-century. There's a kid going on a quest-- that's been a mainstay of fantasy since long before Tolkein drew a breath. There's a mysterious helper. (And to be fair, Paolini draws not from Tolkein, but from pulp fiction, for his mysterious helper, save that the guy's a mysterious helper.) There are bucolic little towns that end up smoldering piles of ash. Yeah, it's all fantasy staple, guys. Tolkein doesn't hold the copyright.Now, consider Eragon in the wider realm of fantasy, and what you have is a pretty predictable five hundred odd pages. Boy finds egg. Boy gets egg. Boy (almost) loses egg. Egg hatches. Boy meets dragon. Dragon is pursued by Half-Bestial Adversaries(TM). Boy and dragon must find safety, and oh yeah, overthrow the evil emperor while they're at it. Lots of dashing and danger and rescues at the last minute, with the requisite deus ex machina moments, some elves, a dwarf or two, an apocalyptic final battle, etc. In all honesty, it reminds me far more of Robert Jordan than it does Tolkein, but without the endless tramping around in the woods.The trick is, of course, that this is genre fantasy, and so predictability is to be expected; folks want to be safe when they read genre fiction. (Perhaps this is the reason Steve Erikson's fan base is still so criminally small in the States.) This is, simply, good, solid fun, and it makes me want to read Eldest, the second in the series-- which is, if I'm guessing correctly, what the first book in a trilogy is supposed to make you do. So it works, at least it works for me. ***"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"okay this book was... ok.

Yes, this hero on a quest for good is a format that has been used by all the master creators of fantastical fiction: Tolkien, McCaffrey, LeGuin, even George Lucas. Paolini's version of this age-old story tells of the adventures of Eragon, a poor farmboy in the land of Alagaesia. While in the mountain woods hunting for food to sustain his family through the coming winter, Eragon stumbles upon a strange blue-marbled egg. Before he has the opportunity to hock it for food, the egg hatches, birthing a glittering sapphire-blue dragon--a race of creatures thought to be extinct in the land. Eragon grows close to the dragon, whom he names Saphira--he can actually converse with her in his mind--but before he can reveal her to his family, he finds himself being hunted by the mysterious and dangerous Ra'zac, who are desperate to retrieve the egg for King Galbatorix, the power-hungry ruler of Alagaesia. The Ra'zac burn Eragon's home and harm his family, prompting Eragon to set off on their trail with Brom, the village storyteller who has his own powerful secrets. As their journey progresses, Eragon learns more about his mysterious abilities--in addition to his eerie mental connection to Saphira, he also has the power to perform magic--and grows to accept his destiny as the last Dragon Rider in Alagaesia, a mere boy whose \\"wyrd\\" (a word meaning \\"fate\\" in Paolini's ancient language) is to defeat the Empire King Galbatorix is set on maintaining, and, in so doing, restore peace to the land of Alagaesia.We've all heard the saying, \\"Imitation is the surest form of flattery.\\" Clearly, this is a statement fantasy writer Ann McCaffrey believes in, as she extensively praises Paolini's novel on the back cover of ERAGON. What she doesn't mention is that Eragon's mental communication with Saphira, the telepathic link that is so important a part of dragon and rider's relationship, is an idea lifted directly from her own novels. And McCaffrey isn't the only author Paolini imitates: Tolkien is also very present in ERAGON's pages and is clearly a big influence on the story; however, it would take me too long to cite examples of how this is so, as they are so numerous in ERAGON and will be so obvious to you when and if you read the novel for yourself. But perhaps the plot Paolini most largely imitates is that of George Lucas's STAR WARS. At its most elemental level, ERAGON really is nothing more than the story of one boy who discovers that he is the last of his kind and, after completing extensive training, discovers that his destiny is to do battle with the Empire to restore peace to his land. Luke Skywalker, anyone? Paolini was only 15 years old when he began writing ERAGON and makes no secret that his love of fantasy was what inspired him to tell his own tale; but still, it is a bit disturbing to see all those characters I myself loved so much as a child--and, in fact, still do love--thinly veiled and poorly developed in the pages of a novel in which they so clearly do not belong. The bottom line is, Paolini has produced a pretty darn entertaining novel--as one would expect when it's basically just recycled material from other authors......Albeit recycled in poor prose. As previous reviewers have mentioned, it is apparent that ERAGON was written by a teenager. The book is incredibly uneven; the beginning moves slowly, while the ending is overladen with action. It is obvious that Paolini made extensive use of the thesaurus feature in Word while he was writing the novel, as very elementary prose is punctuated every once in a while by incredibly advanced vocabulary. The English major in me also noticed a disturbingly significant amount of misplaced modifiers in the text, which I'm surprised an editor didn't catch. But, in the midst of all this mediocre writing, I did find one beautiful passage that indicates to me that young Paolini has much potential and may someday be a very good writer, if he stops with the imitation: \\"The sea is emotion incarnate. It loves, hates, and weeps. It defies all attempts to capture it with words and rejects all shackles. No matter what you say about it, there is always that which you can't.\\" And that, my friends, is about as good as the prose gets in ERAGON.Okay, I'll stop being a snob for a minute and admit that there is no way I could have written a 500-page novel at the age of 15, so Paolini does get a certain amount of my respect. Nor could I have created my own language or my own fantasy world. ERAGON is, in all actuality, a very entertaining novel; the Battle of Helm's Deep--uh, I mean Tronjheim--is appropriately exciting, and is one of the better parts of the novel. ERAGON just lacks the atmosphere that the fantasy greats so ingeniously, and so consistently, create. Alagaesia is not Middle Earth, nor is it \\"a galaxy far, far away.\\" Paolini's writing is still too immature to attain the level of greatness he sought by being so imitative of his favorite authors. I'm sure he'll get there eventually, but he must work on developing his own voice instead of relying on the voices of others.So what will happen next with Eragon, our young Jedi--er--I mean--Dragon Rider? Will he succumb to the Dark Side and join the Empire, or will he save his land from certain doom and destruction by completing his training and defeating Darth--er--King Galbatorix? Stay tuned to the next volume in the Inheritance trilogy, ELDEST, to find out! (I know I will; I was guiltily entertained by Paolini's plagiarism and am very interested to see what Eragon's next adventure will be.)"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I truly wanted to enjoy this book. But as mentioned before, the hype that went with it made have actually hurt it, since fantasy readers and 'experienced' readers will expect so much more from such a 'young prodigy'. truth is that the book is not bad, it is a nice and quick read for fantasy fans, but it will be that for younger readers and readers that are just getting into the fantasy books. If you have read Tolkien and Pullman and so many others you will be dissapointed by the book, cause it ends up being a D&D; story, and any HS in the world has a good teen writer that can come up with a book like this. The plot clearly is the product of an inexperienced writer who read Tolkien (old wise man, Elven princess with a thing for the human, a hidden city in the mountains)and saw Star Wars (rebel 'princess' with a thing for the rouge hero, hero finds missing sibbling - this last bit was not part of book 1 but you can see it comming a mile away)and formulated a very simply and predictable story (there was not one single plot twist that surprises or that doesn't have a direct relation with SW and LOTR, except for the telepathic dragon and I've been told that is also an idea from other fantasy series).the kid has potential, but the marketing has over hyped the quality of the book, which would hurt any developing writer. It doesn't help that the author over-hyped himself as well; on his site he claims to strive \\"for a lyrical beauty somewhere between Tolkien at his best and Seamus Heaney's translation of Beowulf\\". Now that is a mouthful not easily lived up to. And from his use of language and prose, his editor should let him know he is years and years away from that.Since he is maturing, hopefully the 2nd book will reflect that, but from the reviews so far, this may not be the case. For younger readers, non-English speakers this is a good choice, since the language is simple, the story easy to follow."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"First up let me tell you something about myself, I enjoy every book from page start to end. No matter what the book it will always appeal to me. But when the book's over, and I think about it, thats when my actual opinion of the book comes out. The same holds true for Eragon. I loved every page of it. A day after I read it, it seemed like crap! The plot is that of every single fantasy book every written. I know there are small differences, like the fact he rides the dragon around, and that the dragon is a large part of the story, but other then that you could switch the main characters name to Frodo and you'd have Lord of the Rings. I'd suggest this book to anyone from the ages 0-13 it might appeal to you, with your small minds."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I have nothing to say about the writing of this book -- in the technical sense. I bought it for my cousin a couple weeks ago, and being me, sneaked a peek at a couple of chapters . . . ended up reading the whole book. I found the writing itself good -- in terms of flow, grammar, etc.I felt the pacing was a little off, however. The book goes on for a very long time . . . and not a whole lot gets done. It seems to try to mimic the epic style of Tolkien, and it doesn't do it very effectively. Tolkien might sound a little archaic, but the pacing is very good, whereas this drags.I also felt that it borrowed too much. Dragon Riders . . . Anne McCaffrey (sp?), Ra'zac . . . Ringwraiths (Tolkien)/Myrddraals (Jordan), Urgals . . . orcs/trollocs. The elves were very Tolkien-esque, as were the dwarfs for the most part, and some of the place names seemed to be taken straight out of LOTR and tweaked a little. The \\"mad\\" Dragon Riders is again reminscent of Robert Jordan (who I felt was weak to begin with) -- the male side of magic being \\"tainted\\", etc.This type of borrowing made the book extremely predictable. Paolini tries to string out the \\"revelation\\" about Brom as long as possible, but I was expecting it for half the book.The main character, Eragon, also feels like a \\"Mary Sue\\". He is athletic, finds the dragon egg, manages to raise the dragon in secret, becomes good with a sword, has magic powers, etc, etc. In short, he is good at whatever he does, and better than everyone else. Once again, predictable.I remember thinking \\"who is this guy?\\" (i.e., the author) while I was reading, and when I saw the note at the back about the book being written by a teenager, it all clicked into place. The writing is good, yes, but immature. In a young author's section, I would doubtless give it kudos . . . but out there among the fantasy books . . . don't spend your time on this. Tolkien was better."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Okay. This kid can write. True. But...the incessant versions of things other than said (assured was one that irked me severely) was aggravating. And the story was SOO cliched, it was incredible. I really could barely stand it. It was just a jumble of every fantasy story you've ever read. And I don't think he \\"was inspired by\\" Tolkien. Get it right. He copied him."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I don't quite know how to begin. The kid is an all right beginner, but really does need to improve before I can truly complement him. To begin with, you don't really relate to his characters the way you do in Tolkien's books, for example. You see them somewhat far off, as if you are watching people from a foreign country, ones whom you don't really know. (Oh, my grammar is pretty bad too.) I couldn't say I was the least bit sorry when those \`good guys' in the book died. It was just like, \`OK, so that's that'. When Eragon gets captured I don't really care, It's as if one of the extras get captured. You can't really identify with them, and you can't get deeply involved in it if you even get involved.One more thing I must write before it escapes my brain is that the \`good guys' are shown stealing (e.g., Eragon steals from a butcher and feels good about it because he doesn't like him; Brom steals money etc.) They are also depicted as liars, and living life only to get revenge. I think that we should not be teaching children to think that stealing from those you dislike will make you feel good, that you can lie and get away with it and that you should live for revenge. I think that some parents might want to look through this book before letting their son or daughter read it.Eragon is fifteen when the book starts and is the image of a Hollywood teenager--he knows more than adults and feel as though they should not be telling him what to do; you can talk back to adults and not get in trouble for it etc. Though he gets a little better as the story wears on, its downright irritating! Children should not think that this is the ideal lifestyle.As for the story, it needs much work. He needs to cut down on the flowery descriptions! It drags you away from the point and you forget what he was talking about. He uses very modern characters and shoves them into medieval setting. They don't seem as if they should be wielding swords! I was shocked to see the phrase \`how come' in the text.I don't want to get to harsh, and you probably have or will read this in all the other reviews, but I'll say it any way. Paolini just isn't very creative. He needs an original story and original names.Paolini could be a great author in the future, but he needs to take it slowly, listen to people's criticism, and therefore improve his writing. I do congratulate him though for writing such a book at such a young age, but he really does need to work on it."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Although I do give the author credit for being so young and publishing what must have been quite an undertaking, the end result is still a confusing mishmash of a fantasy story clearly written by a writer before his time. The main character expresses himself in some very illogical ways. Example: He gets \\"angry\\" at the blue stone he finds when it wakes him up one night. (????) If a blue stone was rolling around your bedroom, would your first reaction be anger at REM interruption or general surprise and shock? The rest is more of the same, added to an assembly of skin-deep characters and a propensity for utter, recurring, consistent, on-going, verbose adjective addiction in describing even the simplest thing."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"As a long-time SF&F; fan I read it with a somewhat critical eye, and was initially pleased. The harshness of Eragon's life and the details of his existence in Carvahall brought an immediacy to the story. However, as the events grew more and more fantastic, my enjoyment grew less. Paolini could have used another round of editing; one grievous instance was during Eragon and Saphira's flight through a cloudbank. As they soar through, Eragon (an ignorant farmboy who has never left his mountain village and can't read) compares the clouds to cathedrals and buttresses. A little hard to swallow.His relationship with the dragon remains fresh, but the fantasy elements grow a bit wearisome by the end."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I read Eragon reluctantly because of what my friends told me it was about. I was sorely mistaken. Eragon ranked somewere in the top five of my all time favorite books. It is about a farm boy named Eragon whose everyday life is shattered and embarks on a mission to restore the legendary Dragon Riders and defeat the evil king Galbatorix. The reference to the differnt languages and pronunciation in the back was extremely useful. I loved the thrill as Eragon journeys onward and learns more magic and words in the Ancient Language. A tragedy that disrupts Eragon's journey adds to the excitement, as he meets scores of both life-trusting friends and deadly foes.Eragon is one of those must read books for children ages 9-15. Paolini's Eragon weaves a web so intense that when I turned the last page and saw the words\\"END OF BOOK ONEThe Story Will Continue InELDESTBook Two Of Inheritance\\"I wished that it was coming out the very next week. At least I have something to look forward to.I think it is a true miracle that Christopher Paolini could have written such a wonderful work of art starting at 15 years of age and ending at 19."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Every now and then, there's a massively hyped book that catches thwe attention of media and readers alike. Teen author Christopher Paolini's &quot;Eragon&quot; is probably the most-publicized fantasy since the Harry Potter series. Is it as good as they say? In a word... no. Paolini has raw, unrefined talent and an undeniable flair for writing, but he's bogged down by every fantasy cliche in the book.Eragon is an impoverished lad living with his uncle in a secluded village, barely scraping by. That changes when he finds a strange blue stone in the woods. He tries to sell it, with no luck -- it's harder than diamond, and no one knows what it is. Then it hatches -- into a baby dragon. When Eragon touches her, he accidently burns a scar into his hand and forms a mental bond that allows them to communicate without speaking.He raises the dragon in secret, naming her Sephira, until his farm is attacked and his uncle Garrow murdered by the evil minions of the ex-Dragonrider Galbatorix, who is now the evil king. Seeking revenge, Eragon gets the help of the old storyteller Brom, who is more than he seems. When the new Dragonrider (Eragon, of course) sets off with his new friends, he sets out to deal with Galbatorix...Is &quot;Eragon&quot; an amazing fantasy? No. Is it bad? Again, no. The handling of much-worn elements is clumsy but hints that he has promise. Paolini's writing has a certain eagerness that makes his story somewhat appealing, but fails to overcome his inexperience. The storyline is one that has been done elsewhere; it's a fairly standard S&amp;S quest-against-evil.Nobody could accuse Paolini of being too innovative. Young, clueless hero raised by an uncle in the wildlands? Check. Wise old magical man who teaches the hero? Check. Ancient sword? Check. Dragons? Wise and fair elves? Evil magical villain? Stumpy, grumpy dwarves? Check. We've seen these all before, in fantasies ranging from &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; to &quot;Star Wars&quot;; there's even a bit of Ursula Le Guin's &quot;true names&quot; tossed in. Arguably this could be seen as a more fantastical retread of Arthurian legend, but that doesn't make it original.What boosts up &quot;Eragon&quot; is the writing. Paolini has a genuine flair for description of landscapes and places, right down to the raging storms and burned-out villages. His writing is still a bit raw (some is horribly awkward), but he has a talent for writing action scenes and a solid ability to bring up what things look, smell, sound or feel like. He also has the ability to evoke emotions when the characters feel them, such as Eragon's grief when he sees Garrow dead.Eragon himself is a pretty typical fantasy hero, rather angsty and uninformed. He's likable, but not really compelling yet. Saphira is rather spotty; sometimes she's alien and intriguing, and sometimes she seems almost like a human with scales. Brom is your typical old wizard who knows everything, and Arya your basic fair elf maid love-interest. Unfortunately she isn't really given much of a personality in the brief time we see her.Paolini has some raw talent and a pleasant writing style, which keep &quot;Eragon&quot; from being truly annoying. A mixture of the obviously derivative and the intriguing, &quot;Eragon&quot; is worth a look, but not yet any more."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I made an exception for this book.I can't remember how I stumbled across \\"Eragon\\", but I was at loose ends after the third film of the Lord of the Rings series (and I've read the Tolkien books too many times to count) and I found myself craving more flights of fancy and fantasy. I was taken by the fact that a 15 year old prodigy had begun such an ambitious endeavor, for author Christopher Paolini is planning to write a trilogy about his young hero, Eragon, who goes from poor farm boy to a young master, growing in power, of magic. This first book is subtitled: \\"The Inheritance\\".Paolini's family first self-published 10,000 copies, and Floridian Carl Hiassen helped to sell the fantasy to Knopf, which later released a first national printing of over 100,000 copies.Paolini embraces the standard fantasy world of humans, dwarves and elves (no hobbits, here!), and adds the existence of dragons, nearly extinct, as creatures of power. Elves, and sometimes humans, are selected by hatchling dragons to become Dragon Riders, companions of dragons who can communicate with them and others by telepathy. Riders have magical powers, but the use of magic drains them of much energy.The evil forces of the land are somewhat more creative. Sluggish, warring monsters (Tolkiens' Orcs?), the Urgals, abound, but are no threat until they are organized for the king by the evil Ra'Zac (creatures of the King that are not human, covered in cloaks, and strongest at night) and the terrifyingDurka, who is a Shade (a spirit in human form, with crimson hair and maroon eyes) all of whom are working for the king, and trying to locate Eragon and his dragon.Set in the fantasy world of Alagaesia, Eragon's land is ruled by Galbatorix, who once was a Rider himself. The adult dragons have all perished, and Galbatorix has been dispossessed of one of three dragon eggs by a group dedicated to ending his cruel rule, the Varden. This egg is conveyed to Eragon, and the dragon hatches in his care. Much of the facts of the land are uncovered as the book moves along, and Eragon is slowly filled in on the history of how he got to be who he is. His mother, Selena, has been missing from his life since he was a child, and the book ends without disclosing the mystery of what happened to her and just who his father was.Alagaesia is bordered by Du Weldenvarden, a deep forest, home to the Elves. It appears that this will be the setting for much of book 2. The country south of the forest is a vast desert that Eragon and his traveling companions must cross to reach safety (the Hadarac). Paolini is particularly clever in devising how the small band of travelers with Eragon gets water while crossing. He's also created rich city and village profiles in the kingdom, as Eragon tries to locate the Ra'Zac, to revenge killings in Eragon's home. South of the desert are the Boer mountains, home to the dwarves, who are assisting the Varden; the climax of the novel takes place in these mountains.Paolini has peppered his cast with strong characters who will assist Eragon in fulfilling his role. Brom, a wise soothsayer, with mysterious origins, becomes Eragon's mentor. Murtagh, a fearless fighter, accompanies Eragon across the desert to the Boer mountains; his history, when uncovered, is somewhat shocking. Arya is the elven woman that fills Eragon's nightmares, and must be rescued by the travelers from a prison, where she has been cruelly tortured at the hands of Durka. Ajihad is the strong leader of the Varden and Hrothgar the King of the dwarves, both of whom risk their followers to assist the young Rider. Two of the most interesting characters are Angela, an herbalist and her werecat, Solembum, both of whom are much more than they seem. Eragon encounters them more than once in this novel.Above all, Saphira, the dragon that Eragon hatches and accepts for his own, weaves a magical air into the story, and her relationship to the homeless boy, and their telepathic communion and communication, form the strong story background that sets \\"Eragon\\" apart from much of what has been written in the genre in the past.Paolini's a rich storyteller, with short chapters, and action-packed scenes. He doesn't forget to give his hero a conscience, nor does he fail to set the tone for the second book in the series, \\"The Eldest\\". I very much enjoyed the read, and hope he's close to finishing the second in the trilogy."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Eragon is a pure fantasy tale of adventure, a bildungsroman. All the necessary pieces for the story are in Eragon. Mr. Paolini has a solid grasp of storytelling. His skill kept me up too many nights, engrossed. I am a high school English teacher, with an MFA in Creative Writing. I am famililar with Mr. Paolini's path to Knopf from being published by his parents publishing company. After I read the Knopf Eragon, published this year, I obtained one of the paperback Eragon from Interlibrary Loan. I was fascinated to compare the two versions. Mr. Paolini said on a radio show I heard, that the Knopf Eragon has 20,000 less words than the original paperback edition from his family publishing company. To tell the truth, I enjoyed reading both versions. Knopf's was tighter and faster in pacing. The original had more descriptions of places, events, and Eragon's interior thoughts. Eragon has a high page count, over 500 pages. Editing a manuscript of that size is a daunting task. I am a part-time freelance editor; the quality of the Knopf edit (what we classify as a light edit) is superb. What impresses me also is the quality of the editing that the Paolini family did for the original book. Mr. Paolini's Eragon poses a challenge to the followers of Tolkien, McCaffrey, Brooks, Eddings, Williams, and Lewis, the old guard of fantasy. Eragon is high quality fantasy fiction. It's excellent in story and execution. What scares the old guard is that this young man has thrown the guantlet down: here is a first book that hits its mark. Writers and authors of decades more experience than this young man are understandably unnerved. I can imagine the professional jealousy, bitterness, and ulcers Mr. Paolini's success is causing. I eagerly await Mr. Paolini's next installment of the Inheritance Trilogy. An inspiring young author and one to watch."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"The first thing that any potential reader needs to know is that in Eragon they have found a book containing the distilled essence of fantasy-an epic quest, a majestic dragon, and a dark evil-but also a book containing the rare genius of Christopher Paolini, a completely new writer to the field, that breathes into the story a vitality and freshness that makes you think, &quot;This is what all those other fantasy authors were trying to write.&quot;The characters of Eragon at first seem like your basic archetypal fantasy people: a young boy without a mysterious past, an old storyteller who obviously knows more than he's telling, an evilly twisted magic user, and a grand elven lady. But as you become immersed in the story-which occurs fairly quickly-the characters begin to take on a life of their own, becoming more real as each event plunges them further into danger and uncertainty, so that by the time the last page falls they are old friends, ones that you eagerly look forward to seeing again. Christopher's prose breathes life into the characters of Eragon.The characters are not the only strength of Eragon, however. The land of Alagaesia in which they live is also incredibly realistic, and it and the trials that Eragon faces lend credibility to the story that much fantasy lacks. For although Eragon is fantasy to the core, it also contains many realistic elements. Eragon is not able to overcome all odds from innate &quot;gifts&quot; but instead must work for his achievements. Eragon is a boy trying to find his way in a world that has suddenly become much more hostile than ever before, and his story is one of tangible reality.And this is why Eragon is such an incredible book. Not because it is excellently written (even though this is another good reason to read it), nor because it embodies so much of what fantasy has come to mean, but because Christopher Paolini has breathed a realistic life into his characters and their world which makes the reader care. Or to sum it up in a single short phrase:This is a darn good book."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I loved this book and it kept me on the edge of my seat, reading long into the night (after I had been told to go to sleep repeatedly by my mom). The dragon, Saphira, is my favorite character. It's a great page turner and I recommend it to anybody who likes fantasy books."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"First off, I've read more than my fair share of YA and fantasy, and this book is by far the BEST. The people that are writing bad reviews on this book have no idea what their talking about, Christopher Paolini has LOTS of talent, and, he's FIFTEEN for crying out loud!I can see how people would come to the conclusion that this isn't original; it may be a little like LOTR ( Lord of the Rings) with CP's usage of elves and dwarves, but just because he uses them in his books doesn't mean that he's copying them--aside from the elves and dwarves, I see no common denominator between the two. If you want to call something un-original, feel free to look at any one of the thousands of TWILIGHT re-writes.Pro's: The book is very well writen, very discriptive without being too discriptive. Character development is amazing, you feel like you know the characters, and you love them. You feel like you're there, like you're just sitting in the backround watching everything that is going one. CP doesn't always give the happy endings, so you honestly don't know what to expect.Con's: None.Christopher Paolini has loads of talent, and ERAGON has fully earned the five stars--I literally couldn't put it down. I can't wait until he come's out with the fourth!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Don't get me wrong, I think its well written. And almost every modern fantasy writer draws on LOTR alot. But they have the advantage of doing it more...subtley.But even that might have been excusable if it had been a bit more interesting with a slight hint of unique style. I also agree with everyone else in that it was predicdtable. But the thing that really annoyed me? The fact that Eragon did not seem real. Even Brom seemed more realistic than the main character. And the way that Paolini kept on dropping BIG hints that Eragon was going to have this romantic love affair. That has really put me off the next book. And I wonder who the lover is going to be? A beautiful elf. My advice is to read Terry Prattchet instead who at least uses characters who seem stereo-typical but really are as unpredictable as you can get."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I first read this book when I was eight and have recently re-read it. It is still as good as last time, and probably always will be. It tells the story of Eragon, a poor farmer boy, who finds a dragon egg. The egg hatches into a dragon named Saphira, and together along with Brom, they have many exciting - and extremely dangerous - adventures. It starts off as a quest for revenge, but soon turns into something much, much bigger. The story is influenced by books such as LORD OF THE RINGS, which I highly recommend, both book and movie. Filled with elves, dwarves, sorcerers, and of course dragons, ERAGON is a book definitely worth reading which you just can't seem to put down."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This book was wonderful!

Then I saw it in a catalog, and heard people talking about it, so checked it out of the local library to see what it was all about.I got hooked. It is so refreshing to read a really good book, rather than the mediocre novels that usually inhabit the shelves of the bookstores and libaries. Eragon surpasses everything I have ever read, save for the Abhorsen Trilogy by Garth Nix. I literally could not put it down. I started it one morning this past summer, and read it straight through, stopping only to eat, and when my eyelids finally closed at three in the morning. Some say that eragon faints too much. There is a difference between fainting and getting knocked out.Ok, sure, it is not perfect. Less questions might be good, but it takes skill to write even the worst book, and to write something this good... Christopher Paolini is a genius. He wrote it when he was 15!!! that is a rare age to create a fantastic story.If you need to read a book, read Eragon. I read it seven times in the three months that I had it out from the library. You won't be disappointed! even if it does not make your top ten, I guarentee that it will take you away to a world out of our own, where dragons fly high, and adventure lurks around every corner...."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"\\"Eragon\\" is the first book in the Inheritence trilogy (the other two books haven't been written yet). It is the story about a fifteen-year-old farm boy named Eragon who discovers a mysterious blue stone in the forest near his home. At first, Eragon intends to sell it for much-needed money, but when a very rare and powerful dragon hatches from the \\"stone\\", Eragon is immediately thrown into an adventure that he isn't prepared for! He's forced to flee his village with his dragon, Saphira, and an old storyteller, Brom, after his grandfather is brutally murdered. Before long, Eragon finds himself unwillingly at the center of an ongoing war between elves, dwarves, men, primitive Urgals, fiendish Shades, and the evil King Galbatorix.With elves, dwarves, magic, and all of the other fantasy elements in the story, it's impossible to ignore the similarities between this book and the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy. But, even so, \\"Eragon\\" is still a very entertaining book with plenty of originality. Christopher Paolini uses the perfect amount of detail to make the story incredibly believable, but not so much that the story drags on longer than it needs to. Though there were a few slow parts, especially in the beginning, there was enough suspense built up to keep you reading and wondering about what would happen next. All of the main characters in \\"Eragon\\" have their own unique personalities, and the way they interact with each other makes them seem very real. Actually, though \\"Eragon\\" is obviously a fantasy book, many aspects of it were quite realistic, such as Eragon's numerous self-doubts and weaknesses: two things that main characters often lack. Even the made-up geography and languages of Paolini's world are very intricate and well thought-out.The only thing that might annoy some people about \\"Eragon\\" is that it's very complicated and often confusing at times. There over fifty different names of people, places, and animals that are used throughout the story, so if it weren't for the glossary and maps in the back of the book, I would have been hopelessly lost! But if you really enjoy reading fantasy/adventure stories like \\"Lord of the Rings\\", then you shouldn't let that stop you from reading \\"Eragon\\"! The continuous excitement and suspense will surely keep you hooked throughout the whole first part of Eragon's long journey!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I must admit, I went into this book expecting to dislike it. I even delayed reading it for a while, only now getting around to it. I thought the media hype and advertising, and the novelty of a 15 year old writer, were the only reason it was getting anywhere. However, I got around to reading it, and found myself enjoying it. Yes, of course it has all the elements of a cliched fantasy, but sometimes I don't have a problem with reading a good old-fashioned fantasy. It's familiar and comfortable, but still a good story, and in this case written out in a nice way. Recognizable from other books we've read, yes. That does not mean it has to be a bad book. Reading the reviews on this site, one thing that has especially irked me is how people stress the unoriginality and resemblance to Tolkien. Tolkien, while revolutionary, was not totally original himself, using many old archetypes, legendary creatures, and fairy tale background. Some people have blamed Paolini for copying Tolkien, citing things like his use of one main guy on a quest with a old wise advisor (Gandalf/Brom). This especially is not just copying Tolkien, it is use of the universal archetype of the quest journey, and exactly this situation is found in old folk tales from throughout the world. Why? Well, it makes sense to have an old wise advisor-can't you see that in real life? In conclusion: familiar but fun. Many of the same cliches have been used in adult epic fantasy with much worse writing, taste, and interest.

Capossere, hey Capossere, you are an idiot! If you are a literary professor/teacher then you should know that this kind of criticism is sometimes called: oh...I don't know...jealousy? What is you work of art? Why aren't you showing us your creativity? Let's see your novel. This book IS a work of fiction and fantasy, did you think dragons really existed? The characters are fine, they aren't shallow. We are not going to know every intimate detail of each character in the first book. Characters change/grow/develop as time passes and that allows us to grow along with them. Allowing your character freedom to grow makes for a realistic read, because everyone changes and you can make your character change as well. They aren't bound to one principle. R.R.Tolkien started Gimli off mistrusting the elves, but Gimli grew to become Legolas' best friend.This novel, to me, falls in line with the brilliance of Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman. I can only say that with time and more sequals to come Christopher Paolini's skill will strengthen and he will become one of the best adventure/fantacy writers.There was a time when a grown man by the name of Piers Anthony ruled the fantasy realm. Christopher Paolini, at the age of 17, has already produced a novel that out weighs Anthony's \\"A Spell for Chameleon\\" by leaps and bounds.My head-piece is off to you, Mr. Paolini!

I was neither drawn to or intrigued by the press I had seen and did not pursue reading the book. I was loaned the book by a young adult who adored it, and picked it up to read out of desperation for new material.On first attempt, I barely made it past the opening. I found the names of places and characters intimidating, and felt I had to concentrate to keep people distinguished and places defined. I put the book aside. On second attempt, I decided to just \\"roll with it\\" and found that after the initial chapters, I had learned the names and places from repetition.In terms of story, the themes and ideas are familiar. While I have not read the Lord of the Rings trilogy, I am familiar with the story via the film version - and can see the comparisons. An unlikely hero out to conquer the dominating evil with his band of likeminded companions.Without giving away too much of the plot, I thought many aspects were thoroughly predictable (Brom's past, the woman Eragon dreams of). Alot of story archs were left hanging - but that is to be expect in the first of a 3 part story. I will hope to see the conclusion in subsequent books.Admittedly, it took me a bit to get in to the story, but I ended up being drawn in. I was entertained by the story, and was anxious to read the second installment to see how the story continued."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Book ReviewEragonChristopher PaoliniI just finished reading the book Eragon. It is the second book of the Inheritance trilogy. In the first book of the series, which is called Eragon, a boy named Eragon is hunting the woods when a mysterious stone appears out of nowhere. He assumes it was transported there by magic. After a few weeks he is sleeping in his room and the stone is moving. He wonders why the stone is doing this, and after about ten minutes of the stone shaking, it cracks open and a baby dragon pops out of the egg! A few days later two mysterious people enter the town called the \\"razac\\" and they kill his father Garrow. A man name Brom agrees to aid Eragon in finding the razac and getting revenge. As they are traveling together Eragon finds out that Brom isn't a regular person, he was once a dragon rider too. Dragon riders were ancient people who helped govern the land by the help of dragons. Brom helps train Eragon and soon Eragon can use magic. When Brom and Eragon find the Razac's lair, the Razac ambush them at night and while doing so they kill Brom, but Eragon was saved by a mysterious person who he later finds out is called Murtagh. After Brom is killed Eragon and Murtagh travel to the Varden, which is a rebel group who hates the empire and defies them. Eragon hopes to overthrow the evil king of the empire Galbatorix.In the second book there will be many more twist and incredible surprises that will have you on the edge of your seat. Will Eragon travel to Du Weldenvarden and train with the mysterious elves? Will he re-unite with his brother Roran? You will find out why Eragon is attracted to the elf Arya. Most importantly you will find out if Eragon will fulfill his destiny and kill the twisted King Galbatorix, who is also a rider.My reaction to the book Eragon is that it is a scintillating book. You never know what is going to happen next and it is extremely hard to put the book down! There is a lot of humor in the book. It also brushes the topics of adolescence of a teenager and talks about the emotional part of someone close to you dying. Another thing that I noticed about the book is that it is the perfect book for a kid who isn't challenged by reading an ordinary chapter book, but who will have difficulty in reading a book such as the Lord of the Rings, which might be to complex for someone. This is one of the best books I've ever read and I can't wait for the third book of the Inheritance Trilogy to come out, which is likely to be called Empire."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"i finshed reading this book in one week i think its one of the greatest fantasy novels and a new meaning of fantasy writing the book is clearly holding the same plot of some other books but the great thing that its much more interesting and very thrilling but of course it had some boring chapters that i forced myself to read like \\"the hadarac desert\\" , \\"the ramr river\\" and other chapters that was totaly boring but there was some great chapters too so if you like fantasy reading then this book is for you...and i am starting eldest.....p.s in 2007 well be realesed the last book of the inheritance series it well be named \\"empire\\" with green cover and green dragon thats what christopher said"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Like many other reviewers said, please ignore the bad reviews and read this awesome book for yourself.

I think it's a griping story. I was slowed by some of the dialogue, a lot of the writing is forced. But since the writer is 15 and I knew that going into it I was surprised by the book. I guess if I had expected a great epic I would have disappointed, but I expected a rip-off. Because of the name I associate it with Aragorn from LOTR, it however is very unlike LOTR. It's fast paced, very humanistic in my view, and ultimately more doomed in a way. The hero could be anyone (though honestly it can't). It gives the book a hopeless appeal. You want the hero to overcome, but you know it would be easier for failure. It was easy to fall in love with the characters, and I loved the excess background. It reminds me more of Potter than any other series. But the interesting thing is although it's your cut and dry fantasy, there are many twists on the old standby's which I enjoyed, and would now view as standbys.

I hope you give this book a chance, I believe you will enjoy it too."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I will first tell you that I rather enjoyed \\"Eragon\\". I read it and liked it before I discovered that Paolini was a 17-year-old published author (which, although it is impressive he wrote the hefty tome, I find it a tad easier to be published at 17 when one has parents who own a publishing company.) However, I find Paolini to be insufferable with an abnormally inflamed ego. (\\"I strive for a lyrical beauty between Tolkien and Beowulf?\\")However, I did enjoy the book. I thought, despite its written flaws, it was a good if cliched plot and told in a rapid, hooking manner. Yes, it is cliched, people. I say this to both the Eragon supporters and the Eragon haters. It takes a good deal from The Lord of the Rings and Star Wars, to name just a few. But frankly, I think Eragon is better than the Lord of the Rings. I have also read that series and found it horribly dull. Sure, sure. It's a ground-breaking story, the father of all fantasy. Whatever. It's as insufferably boring as Paolini is insufferably egocentric. If you can't stand Eragon because it appears to be a rip-off, think of it as fan-fiction that surpasses the original story's quality.Eragon doesn't quite live up to all the hype, however. It's a good novel, but I think most of the media attention is because Paolini's young. But just because there's some borrowed material doesn't make it a bad book. Hopefully by the time Paolini's older, he'll have used his \\"Inheritence\\" trilogy as a learning experience and be able to create more original plotlines. Personally, I'm looking forward to the rest of the trilogy, and if you aren't a stiff, you will likely enjoy it as well."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Eragon is one of my favorite books, and I expect that it will always be that way. The story is gripping and the charecters vivid. One of my favorite aspects of the book is the Ancient Language, a language created by Christopher Paolini based primaraly on old norse. The languages created by the author give the world a depth and history not found in many other books.Se onr sverdar sitja hvass!May your swords stay sharp!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"ERAGON is a gripping story that I think is creative, absorbing, and it gives you a sense of being in a different world, following the steps of Eragon, Brom and Saphira.Eragon is a teenaged boy livingin a time of Kings, war, dragons, elve realms and magic. Eragon is hunting along the Spine Mountains, when he comes across a blue sparkling stone, a big one at that. The stone is a mysterious item and gives Eragon the fright of his life. So begins the quest of a boy, a dragon and a storyteller.This book has a strong plot is nailbiting and very enjoyable. It empasises love, death, courage and magic.I would reccommend it for anyone over ten years old and up. Boys, girls and adults will LOVE this book, a lot!!!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"\\"One boy, one dragon, and a world of adventure.\\" Thats the topic in the book Eragon by Christopher Paulini. When Eragon finds a polished blue stone in the forest, he later realizes that the stone is a dragon. Overnight, his life changes to a world of destiny, magic, and power. With the help of a sword and a storyteller, he has to navigate through dangerous terrains to conquer a dark enemy. The genre of this interesting book is mythological fairy tale and non-fiction. There is an other book in this series called Eldest.I very well recommend this book to reader's who like adventure and fairy tale books.

Soon after, his uncle is killed by mysterious creatures called the Ra'zac. Eragon then leaves with his dragon, Saphira to avenge his uncle by hunting down and killing the Ra'zac.This fantasy book is full of adventure and I strongly recommend it to everybody. When I started the book I couldn't put it down and it seemed like the pages turned them selves. Christopher Paolini really brings you into the book and you feel like you're in the book with Eragon.

Tolkien. I was excited about the prospect of another epic trilogy like Lord of the Rings; when I read the book, however, I realized that it was too much like aforementioned trilogy. The young hero Eragon (sounds a little too much like Aragorn, or am I being nit-picky?) lives in a Rohan-esque village until mysterious, cloaked and hooded strangers (it's a good thing they aren't on horses, or they would have been exact replicas of Black Riders) come and blow up Eragon's home and fatally wound his uncle. Why? It seems that Eragon has found a dragon egg in the Spine (reminiscent of Mirkwood) which consequently hatches, etc. Eragon's world is too much like Middle Earth- the elves came over the sea (we've heard that before), the dwarves live under the mountain. Paolini's Urgals are basically Orcs with horns; the Kulls are Uruk-hai with different names. Even the Urgal language is similar to Orc language- \\"ushnark\\" for father and \\"sharku\\" for old man/ father. The similarities are overwhelming- the ancient language sounds much like Quenya or Sindarin (Tolkien's Elvish languages.)The bottom line: Though the books are technically well- written (though I did tire of Paolini's overly descriptive language; the readers DO have imagination, and Paolini's avoidance of the word \\"said\\" is annoying), there is very little original material. Christopher Paolini's book may be good, considering his age, but the lack of originality begs the question: Would Eragon have existed if Tolkien didn't write the Lord of the Rings trilogy? I think not."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Don't bother wasting your time reading this book if you have conveniant access to either a copy of the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" or perhaps \\"Dragonriders of Pern\\". Not only does Paolini \\"borrow\\" characters, theme, and overall plot from both professional works, but he practically takes them and strangulates them into his own \\"retooling\\". This book is just plain awful and I honestly regret ever having shelled out the cash to purchase it."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This book is horrible. Don't waste your money. I'd rather read a matchbook than this travesty. HOW did this get published?

It had been on my reading list for a while, though I knew from the mixed reviews how derivative it would be. Curiosity got the better of me.I am an avid reader of classic fantasy, so I agree whole-heartedly with B. Capossere's review. Eragon has taken me over a month to read, because I kept getting bored. The story may be exciting for young readers, but offers very little in the areas of originality and meaning. The writing is very young. I was impressed at first with the mature vocabulary, but when it comes to actual writing skill, it is sorely wanting. It follows a formula, with less reason than most. The entire series of scenes with the Varden were so illogical that I wanted to rewrite it. But the entire book seems hastily written, with very little character development or logic to the plot. It's just a young person's excuse to write...which is not a bad thing, I'm totally for creative writing at all ages. But if CP sees the need to improve his writing and does so, he may later regret the publicity given this rank amateur effort. It really should have stayed a practice novel.To be fair, I have to say that some of the descriptive paragraphs are very beautifully written."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Like Eragon was like the best book like ever!!!!I like read it in a day, and i think like all of the other reviewers are stupid for saying that Eragon is bad cuz like Eragon is GREAT.Okay, I'll stop now....but that's what some of the five-star reviewers sound like to me. They sound as if they have never read a book in their life (with the exception of some). Obviously, Eragon is a rip-off of so many other books!!!! It really teed me off! The stuff about the elves and dwarves didn't bother me too bad, but the Razaac really annoyed me!!! NAZGUL!!!!I hated this book. Paolini doesn't have any original ideas, and the only good character is Angelina, who was based off of Paolini's sister, so maybe that's why she's realistic.....This book had more than the Lord of the Rings in it....The Dragonriders of Pern rip offs made me cry.

What is really impressive, however, is the fact that this book actually made the NY Times Book Review Bestseller List. This book is dull and unimaginitive, and the writing is hardly anything impressive. It was written by a 15 year old, but it seems like someone a lot younger actually came up with this cliche plot. Eragon is whiny, not to mention a tragic farmboy-turned-hero, and he gets a mentor, who eventually dies, only to turn out to be famous, blah blah, he falls in love with an elf...anyone see ANYHTING of interest in this?I am honestly an avid reader, and I made it to page 252 of the book before I finally gave up with the boring, unengaging plot and the main chracter, whom I want to bash in the head. (Not to mention the entirely useless descriptions of objects and other various elements of the book that have nothing to do with the plot, or anything at all. If the descrptions are useful for anything, it's adding to the page count.) If Paolini intended for Eragon to be a substitute for himself, then I imagine he must be a whiny, cocky imp, too.

Those with no originality, which were the majority of kids in school, sprinkled glitter and crappily and happily glued little bows on the card. Those few who rebelled and wanted to differ from the class herd, drew Santa on fire or added some far different materials on it. The point of the metaphor is,Yeah, you love/like Eragon, not so much because it is your genuine preference, but because you do not want to differ from the class herd. That and you probably lack a basic reading in significant literature. But hey, if this author can sell-out and sell his books out, more power to him. You have a right to your opinion.

Today at school before I wrote this, I told my friend that i was writing a review on Eragon (he has read Eragon and Eldest and loved them). I told him that i hated the book and Paolini copied some names in the books. My friend said, \\"Just because they sound almost the same, it doesn't mean he copied them.\\" Ok here's a little note to Matt(my friend): For one thing there were A LOT of names that Paolini copied.

Here is what he said: according to him, where he lives, you can't just walk out and get a book to read from a store, because the area was rather lonely and too far from ... well civilisation. So, every book his mother got him, he read them all. What next? He decided to sit down (when he was 15, mind you) and write a book that had every one of his favourite stories merged in it. And I tell you, if this is a replica of the lord of the rings, IT IS TIMES 100 FAR BETTER THAN THE LORD OF THE RINGS. Face it, Tolkien was from another planet. He wrote a book that described the movement of flowers when the breeze blew (WHAT DA **** DO I NEED TO KNOW THAT FOR?!!!).And for those of you who keeping running your mouths about the book sounding like Harry Potter, well, guess what: CHRISTOPHER PAOLINI NEVER READ HARRY POTTER WHEN WRITING THIS BOOK. HE READ IT 'AFTER' HE WROTE THE DAMN THING, KNUCKLE HEADS!No book is perfect, and certainly not a 100% original. Wanna bet? You think J.K Rowling was the first to start wizard and witches in school? I don't think so. You think she was the first to start \\"boy finds out that he most kill bad guy, because it's his destiny\\"? I do not think so!I write books. I know how it feels like. Majority of you DON'T. So, shut up! This is what writing bad reviews can do to someone: make that person miss out in a great story. If you don't like it, burn it, shove it in your attic, do something, but please, please, please, don't come here with ignorant words and make a fool of yourselves!This guy writes a book (it sounds like the LOTR, HP, STAR WARS ...

What still bugs me are the LOTR similarities.Elves,dwarves,an evil emperor who we never actually see. Also this story's ERAGON is very much like LOTR's ARAGORN whether it's they have an elf girlfriend or that their names basically sound the same. Same case with the Harry P. craze.

How about riding a dragon or talking to a dragon? Well, Eragon is your answer. Eragon is a book of magic, mystery, and allows you to imagine everything that is happening. Written by Christopher Paolini, this wonderful, adventurous fiction book is recommended for kids ages 11-14. Everything all gets stirred up when a young farm boy, Eragon, is hunting in the Spine (a place where 15 year old boys shouldn't be). That is, he is hunting until he comes upon a polished blue \\"stone\\". But when the \\"stone\\" hatches into a dragon, Eragon becomes this dragon's rider. After weeks of practice, Eragon and his dragon, ( Saphira), become the last to brave ones to defeat King Galbatorix.There are several different characters that all play a tremendous role. There is Eragon, whose road of the simple life as a poor farm boy just turned the other way when he is committed to being responsible for this dragon. Saphira, another very important, sweet, bright, character, is the dragon that Eragon is now responsible for. The last and surely least character is King Galbatorix. He is an evil King ruler who wants to own the whole land of Alagasia. Dragons and their riders are sent off to defeat King Galbatorix so they still have freedom.The story of Eragon takes place in the magical land of Alagasia. Alagasia consists of The Spine, Beor Mountians, Du Weldenvarden, Surda, and Hadarac Desert. The story is also not a modern day story, but it seems to have taken place in the past. It is interesting in stories, especially in Eragon, when they are in the past because it is cool to see how their way of living is; like how they ride their horses, and how they respect their recourses a lot more than we do!The theme of the book is friendship and the vivid description in the text clearly shows that. When Eragon find out that is Saphira dies, he lives on, but if he dies, so does Saphira, they really become close friends. They take every day together for granite because they really don't have a lot of time left together. They really need friendship to get on with this frightening commitment and they need to work as a team.This book ends peacefully, that is if you forget about how they have a war (Galbatorix vs. Eragon and Saphira). I really liked this action packed book and I think anyone in the ages of 11-14 that like magic, mystery, adventure, and a little bit of twist all in one book would love it to! Who knows, maybe if you like this book, you might even consider reading its sequel, Eldest!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Eragon is one of the best books ever.

The book I'm writing this review about is Eragon, by Christopher Paolini. The book takes place around the medevil ages in the 1600's in early Europe. I would classify the genere of this book as fantasy and adventure because of the dragons and the long journeys. The story is about a young boy named Eragon, who finds a blue stone that's really a dragon egg. Eragon has to battle to save a kingdom with his dragon, Saphira against dark enemies. There is a sequal to Eragon called Eldest and there is currently a movie out based on this book.

I have not read that much fantasy but even I could see that the plot is ripped straight from Star Wars and LOTR. What I found amazing is even after copying those plots, the author still manages to have his plot run out of steam 1/3 of the way into the book, and we spend the rest of the book wandering about his fantasy world.The characters are uninteresting, I had no emotional connection to them, and by the end of the book I was wishing someone would just kill them all off. I am knee deep in the Game of Thrones series, and those characters come alive on the page, sadly Eragon's characters couldn't be flatter if they were run over with a steam roller, and they all seem to have the same voice. Sad.It took me longer than I expected to finish this book, possibly because I spent half the time rolling my eyes in disbelief. The ink should have been purple to match the prose! What most bugged me, apart from how we don't get decent descriptions of the characters but he spends half a page talking about how pretty a lamp is, apart from the execrable dialogue, apart from the utterly laughable character and place names and language he created, is the way an illiterate farm boy can suddenly become a master swordsman, magician and scholar of ancient languages within a few months. Ridiculous, preposterous, and reeks of a wish fulfillment character. What's the word for a male Mary Sue again? Eragon whines a lot, solves all his problems with magic, never has a problem he can't solve because when he does have a problem he can't solve, he gets knocked out and someone else solves it for him. Grrr.In the end, I was most disappointed that I purchased the kindle version, as burning this book might be more entertaining than having to read it. I think actually that setting fire to yourself would also be more fun, or perhaps getting dental work done without anesthetic, or maybe just getting hit by a bus.The author is coming to a town near here on his book tour. Perhaps I will stop to heckle him, or just ask for my seven bucks back. Or I should scream \\"For God's sake Paolini, SHOW US, don't TELL US\\"To sum this book up in two words, I would say \\"Sadly Lacking\\" would best describe it."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This was to be a gift for my husband who loves the Paolini stories, but also wants hardcovers in 1st edition state.

I returned the item, no problems, and ordered directly from an online book dealer."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Oof, talk about being behind the eight ball. Not only was Eragon published in the bygone year of 2003, but I am not now, nor was I back then, in the target junior high to early high school demographic. Just too old. Anyway, this was a book I picked up on a whim and read some six long years ago. I knew next to nothing about the literary debut of young Mister Paolini and even less about the divisiveness that the novel, and it's sequels, had fostered. The fullness of that division dropped over me when I went to see the film adaptation with some friends a few weeks prior to actually reading the book (yes, Eragon sat on my shelf for a full five months before I perused it's pages. So yes, I suck). After the screening I could hear heated debates about the novel from the (rightfully) fuming audience. Finally, I sat down and read the book that had inspired one of the most hilariously awful movies I had ever seen.Eh. I've read worse.First, let's address the spicy issue if plagiarism. It's clear that Paolini sat down and, over the course of what his publisher & Wikipedia claim was about two years, sewed together every single fantasy story he'd ever set his young eyes upon. The Lord of the Rings, Dragon Riders of Pern (okay, that series is more science-fiction), Earthsea, The Original Shannara Trilogy, The Riftwar Cycle, Garth Nix's Sabriel, and Star Wars are all in there. No, not their influence, but rather the stories, locales and concepts themselves are all lumped in a pile and stitched up. That much is not only clear but also inescapable. It's also not the first time I'd encountered such a situation.From the ages of about six to eight, I watched many a video tape and read many a comic book chock full of the exploits of Flash Gordon and Buck Rogers as well as, behind my parents back, many a Kurosawa film. Imagine my surprise when, at age nine I saw Star Wars for the first time and seeing entire scenes, concepts and plot points lifted wholesale from the videos & comics I had spent the last three years engrossed in. Two years later I read Terry Brooks Sword of Shannara Trilogy only to see it effectively regurgitate the Lord of the Rings but with younger characters and a sword rather than a ring. Now, none of that is what I would call world shaking; it's all old news. It's also almost the same situation that Eragon is in. Almost. The key difference between what Brooks & Lucas did with Star Wars & Shannara and what Paolini did with the opening salvo of the Inheritance Cycle is simple: they gave their stories a paint job.There are two ways to utilize the ideas of others in your fiction. One is to turn the ideas on their heads, using them in new and unforeseen ways all while combining them with your own concepts and writing it in a new way in your voice. This is called giving your fiction it's own identity. The other method is to simply blanket everything with new(er) ideas or mash two or more wildly different ideas, occasionally presented differently. This effectively covers or \\"paints\\" the elements you've borrowed and has the effect of your narrative becoming \\"a re-imagining of an old idea\\" or \\"a new spin on an old idea\\". There's nothing wrong with doing that, but you almost have to do it if you're just uniting differing concepts, otherwise your critics will pummel your work with the dread accusation of plagiarism, which is usually a pretty accurate condemnation. This is where Paolini found himself with his first novel. For me though, I don't look at Eragon as plagiarism. I see the love Paolini had for the stories he grew up with. I see it as a young fans' devotion coming out as fan-fiction. Poorly edited fan-fiction.Y'see, a lack of originality is hardly the only issue plaguing Eragon. This was Christopher Paolini's first work, and his inexperience shows. The dialogue is clunky, wooden and awkward. Not one line spoken, save for a few from the character Brom, feels right or gels with the rest of the narrative. Now couple that with descriptions that come across as painfully verbose. No, really, it often feels as if Eragon was written with a pen in one hand and a thesaurus in the other. So often both dialogue and descriptions run on and on and the overall structure of the writing feels muddied and can bury Paolini's voice as an author. Some sections of Eragon are an absolute chore to get through, especially on a first reading.But the worst part of the whole affair is that the above issues, the fan-fiction feel, the poor dialogue and the bloated prose could've all been solved by an editor. No, not necessarily a good one, just HAVING ONE. Seriously, did Paolini ever run any draft of Eragon past anyone other than his parents? Anyone at all? My god.By now you must be asking why I gave this book a three star rating if it has so many issues and flubs. Well, that's a bit more difficult to explain. There were actually some aspects of Eragon that I enjoyed. I genuinely liked the characters in this book. Yes, they all fit into old archetypes, but that doesn't make them any less likable. Brom, Murtagh, Arya, Orik, Ajihad, Nasuada, Angela, Saphira and many others were all lively and wonderful to get to know. I also relished the fact that characters weren't immune to harm. I've read too many fantasy tales where the heroes will simply walk through danger unscathed, even in genuinely good stories. Hell, at the end of this book, the title character is crippled from a severe blow to the back. And speaking of blows, I found the action scenes to be quite thrilling. Well, at least the ones in the second half of the book. I loved that the main villain of the series, Galbatorix, is never seen, but his presence is felt, be it from the way the characters talk about him (ironic, given the quality of the dialogue), the atmosphere of the novel or through the actions of his minions. It's pretty well handled I feel. I also appreciated the scenes where Eragon and others would show genuine emotion. It's far too common that many characters, especially the male ones, are too emotionally reserved. It was refreshing to see an author remember that it's not a sign of weakness when a hero cries. And overall, despite his inexperience and many amateur mistakes, I really felt that Paolini had some raw talent in him that some proper refinement and editing could've made really shine.In the end, I found Eragon to be and tremendously, at times catastrophically, flawed novel, but also one that's fairly enjoyable in it's own right. And even if you do despise it, look at this way: it, like the excellent Harry Potter and Artemis Fowl series' before it, got the kids reading. And seeing how it isn't Twilight, that counts for something.3 stars out of 5"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Like my title said this wasn't a bad book, but I will say this that I think that my opinion is different than others because of the time that I read it. You see I read Eragon when Brisngr had been out and Inheritance was coming soon. I am a pretty fast reader and I enjoyed the books so soon after Inheritance came out I finished Brisngr and got the last book. So I really didn't have to wait for the other books and become disinterested in the series. That is what I think causes people to not like a series.

But does he grow at all as a character? I don't know, I prefer for there to be some growth along the way. Eragon's the same whiny kid at the end of the story that he was at the start.Recommend it?

Nonetheless, younger, less critical readers will find this book rather enjoyable. I know I did when I was 15. Like the Harry Potter series, this is a series you are meant to start young and grow with.The story is interesting without being overly complicated, and the relationship aspects of the story keep the reader empathetic. Sometimes the language is awkward, but I see that as an addition to the tale rather than a detraction. It also makes sense for the main character, who is a young teenager, to be socially awkward when speaking with much older and more mature audiences. All in all this is a coming of age story sheathed in fantasy.Thus I give it 4 stars for \\"I like it\\" because when I was younger I loved the book and now that I am older I see some of the flaws that a mature author perhaps wouldn't make."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"It's easy to be critical of this book.

The plot and concepts are recycled, the main characters seem a bit too polished and perfect, yet exceedingly annoying, you can tell that the book was written by a teenager, and it all can get really frustrating...And yet despite these obvious flaws, I still managed to get engaged with the story itself. I saw promise in many of the situations and I decided to go on and read the other books. Suffice to say that the author improves in the following books, but this one is easily the weakest book of the trilogy. However, once you accept it for what it is and can overlook the flaws in your reading, you can enjoy it. It is certainly not on the LOTR level or Ursula LeGuin etc. but it is much much MUCH better than the crappy movie they made from the book."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"my uncle and my cousins are super into these books, i hear they are awesome."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This review was written by my daughter, Sarah Gossett:Throughout our education, we are assigned books to read that are not our interest and are often times very dull. After reading \\"Eragon,\\" I found that once in awhile you can find a very intriguing story. Eragon proved this to me. Christopher Paolini is a thriving young author who writes great books. In this story, a young farm boy, Eragon, stumbles upon a stone while hunting. This \\"stone\\" soon hatches into a very real dragon while he names Saphira. Eragon is then launched into an epic journey of adventure, courage, and discovery.Things are changing in Carvahall. People are changing. Things are happening - strange things. Eragon is changing with them. He was just an ordinary boy of fifteen when a blue dragon becomes his soul mate. Strangers come to his town and before he knows it his uncle, who is his guardian is dead, their family farm destroyed, and Eragon is on the run. He is befriended by Brom, a storyteller who turns out to be a former dragon rider. These events composed the dramatic opening scenes in Paolini's first novel, written while he was fifteen years old.Overall, Eragon is a thrilling story with a riveting plot that is full of excitement. For the most part, it is completely thrilling. On the other hand, there are in my opinion, a few areas that could be improved. While functioning as a critic, I would have to say that Paolini uses vocabulary that is quite advanced for the audience he is addressing. It is not as enjoyable to read something that requires one to have immediate access to a dictionary. Furthermore, being a teenage girl, there was not enough romance to meet my expectations. Yes, there a bit of romantic flare between Eragon and Araya; however, it was just that, a flare. There was no relationship at all. I would like to see this area of the story expanded in the following volumes of this series.On the positive side, the book has a truly engaging plot that is unlike most other fantasy tales. Eragon has to overcome loss, love, and many other hardships as he becomes the first dragon rider since Galbatorix destroyed all the other riders centuries ago. Eragon and Saphira are supported by the Varden, rebels who believe in the return of the good riders and fight for the downfall of Galbatorix. This is as much as I am going to reveal because the rest lies within the pages of this extraordinary book.If you only venture out and read the first page, you will be hooked on Eragon and find yourself within the story and its endearing characters. This tale is one of adventure, hope and love that I feel you will truly enjoy. You will be glued to your seat by the adventures of the young dragon rider, Eragon."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Christopher Paolini can be considered a brilliant to all those who like fairytales. In Eragon he tries to convey the classic David versus Goliath story with some extra twist in it by saying quotes like \\"A man doesn't choose their father,\\" and many other stirring quotes.Paolini, who is considered a boy genius, graduated high-school at just 15 years old. After which he started his inspiring series of books about a magical land called Alagasia. When he was just 17 years old he finished the first, and what is considered the most impressive book in the series Eragon. He is also so well renowned that he gets compared to other famous authors such as J.K Rowling, and E. R. Eddison.Even though Paolini's writing is very intricate, and interesting, the book can be a little predictable at times. For example, a lot of his foreshadowing throughout the book is very easy to recognize, remember, and connect to the story. But, as the book goes on the reader gets more drawn into it, and it seems like the reader is a little kid on Halloween day again. His David versus Goliath story is perfected with elaborate details, and expands your imagination. In the end the reader is shocked, irritated, and exhilarated as the book can bring all of one's senses alive as you read it.If the reader enjoys fantasy and stretching your imagination to the maximum this is definitely a book for you. Although, some parts of the book are commonly used in a lot of other similar fantasy books such as situations like unknown origin of family, or the story beginning with poverty. Some of the events used in the book are fascinating, and new. Reading this book takes one's mind on a thrill ride, and it throws in some more modern facts that related it somewhat to more modern day."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"(I'm not a kid, I just haven't got an Amazon account yet.)I first heard of this book from seeing it as one of the top ten best-sellers on this website. After looking through some of the reviews, I figured that this book would be pretty good, and as the last books I read were the harry potter series, my expectations were high as people said it was on par, or better then harry potter. Not only were they wrong on just a few levels, they were also wrong on many, many levels. As you have read from other reviews, this is basically star wars set in the lord of the rings universe. I started reading through it, and kept reading, waiting for something good to happen. Nothing happened, absolutely nothing, in the first 175 pages. There had to be light at the end of the tunnel, I said to myself, so I kept walking, hoping that good would prevail, and the greed of the men of gondor would not succumb to the dark-side of the force.As I continued reading, the cliches and ripoffs put me off abit. It wasnt until the part were Brom the happy-at-times-but-serious and-sometimes-angry-but-still-respected-balrog-fighting wizard guy sung about the \\"sad tale of an elven couple\\"....Not only did the author try to copy the poem that aragorn sings to frodo, but fails, as he could only make up 4 lines. That part made me hate the book, as that was one of my best parts of the Lord of the Rings as it provided one of the many links back to the samirillion. So, from here, I stopped reading.After 2 weeks, I had to start catching the bus to and from schol, and i started reading again. After finishing, I thought it was okay, but that was after pretending that he didn't copy other things. Also, his writing was good, apart from the fact that he tries to sound to majestic in the may he writes, like the way he describes things with similes (*pulls out thesaurus*).I recommend this book to anyone that hasnt read or didnt like lord of the rings, as this is a blatant copy. The star wars ripoffs can be forgiven, along with everthing else he ripped-off.'Nuff said."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"It's pretty impressive to write a novel when your fifteen, I'll give him credit for his effort. But seriously Paolini, use your imaginations a little, try not to make your book SOOOO INCREDIBLY OBIVIOUS THAT IT'S COPYING LOTR, STAR WARS AND HARRY POTTER. For starters, come up with not-so-obivious names instead of Arya(Arwen) and Eragon(Aragorn, Dragon). secondly, don't make your magical creatures so obivious such as Urgals, elves, dwarves and shades. Thirdly, make your dialogue mature but at the same time don't struggle with its maturity, because your dialogues have the feeling that some are mature, while others sounded foolish.Magical creatures doesn't have to be Elves, Dwarves and dragons only, stretch your own imagination, find some Other more original magical creatures, I'm sure you can do it with your writing skill. but you need to improve your story-telling skill."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I was excited when I got this book because I noticed in the biblio that the author is about the same age myself, and that was encouraging to me. I am into writing fantasy a bit myself (and am an English major) but it had never occured to me that I might try to publish anything myself aside from short stories locally. But, after reading this book, all I could think was: \\"Man, if all it takes to get some fame is to be really young and write THIS good, I should write a fantasy trilogy myself!\\" I was not impressed with the book. As other reviewers have said, the book is so reminiscent of Star Wars and LOTR in certain palces that it just makes me want to cringe. The book does not flow well, the descriptions are way to in depth in places (really, the book is not 500+ pages long...had it been properly edited it would half been about 250 pages long), and the whole writing style is somewhat choppy and unnatural. What I mean is, its as if this book was written by 100% effort and 0% natural talent, like an advanced computer scanned Star Wars books, LOTR books, and other fantasy works and then puked out Eragon, mixing story elements of the above mentioned an changing names here and there. I get the feeling that a robot wrote it because it is so unoriginal. Paolini, please, next time, don't write so mechanically, just let it flow. If you have true, natural talent, it should manifest itself NATURALLY!Don't get me wrong, I give two stars because I still respect Paolini for writing so young and trying so hard to become a known author. I think that its very liike that, later on, Paolini will produce some solid work. But this is lame. You can tell it was written by a 15-year old. The characters are unnattractive and two-dimensional, and the author apparently has some strange aversion to the word \\"said\\". The ending to the book is so predictable that you're hitting yourself on the head with the book in the last pages, shouting, \\"Why? Why?\\"I think that this author should have started out working for a video game company writing storylines for RPGs. Its ok for RPGs to have hackneyed plots and storylines. Eragon would have made for a fun video game! But a book...sorry...When I was 15, and younger, I started writing fantasy novels too on my computer to indulge my creativity, most of which were very much in the fashion of LOTR, etc, like Eragon. Had never occured to me to publish any of them, but after reading Eragon, again, I couldn't help but think that I might want to dig up those old computer files and send them to a publisher!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"There are so many other books to read that are fantastic in scope. If you value great storytelling, I suggest reading other authors, such as Garth Nix. His books are so much better than this \\"book,\\" and like others before me, I wonder how this was published."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"U cant reinvent the wheel. And yet you get new tires for your car. Praised to be the newest invention. So how is it that people are so stunned by the fact that he sticks to what is known to the races he uses. He is doing a very good job.Names are hard to come by. And even if it seems like he took it from somewhere, I couldn't care less. How many people are out there on this world with the same name, living different lives, experiencing different pains and joys. How many George's, Jennifer's whoever. Btw as long as it is not spelled the same it isn't the same, is it? All I am saying is that it doesn't have to be a whole new everything to make a good book.Hey but thats just me ;)And like this I see this book. It doesnt bring me to an universe that is in a shifted dimension where the physical rules are not like the one I experience. This is an universe I know. I have learned certain rules of it, have seen(read) different landscapes and have met some of the natives before. It just brings me to a different country. A bit different tribes of the folks. And tells a tale. Yes thats what it does.As to the book itself. I can see that the fluid of the language maybe is not this high or educated or polished or whatever the word for it is, like some might wish. But it does the job in a way not every writer can. And I mean the ones who getting paid for it for years.Another importent point could be that english isn't my native language, because of that it could be more appealing to me how the book is written.For the story there is nothing more to say that is a solid fantasy book. With a very young hero, he is still 16 when the book ends, think about that after you read it. And if u have ever read a book with elves, dwarfes and all the other folks you know what there will be, the arrogance of the elve is worth something for me. I couldn't find \\"real\\" logical flaws because most of the things that might seem not clear, are explained, but it has to be read with some attention. And some will be explained.There is just one little description of the face of the main character Eragon, and its more like it changes and not really how it looks like. But I take that as a plus. This means that I have the space to let my fantasy fly. I have the feeling a lot people have to read \\"everything\\". That wouldn't statisfy me, I need some space which automaticly comes with a good writer like this one. And on other more causel matters for some people, I enjoy explicit description. Like landscapes, weather, buildings, clothes. And Christopher Paolini gives me right that.If you are looking for a solid fantasy book, which I couldn't lay out of my hand till I had finished it(27h). God bless weekends. Here you go.If however you are on the search for something that you haven't heard of before and blasts you to a new dimension dont buy it. It's a good old solid fantasy book, written with style. And characters worth following and meeting.A last point I want to make. It nearly hurts me physical that I have to wait for nearly a half year before I can read how it continues. It is open, it is the first book of a trilogy that is what it is, and until all three aren't published it isn't complete. But hey after I am finished writing this review I am going just to read it again. Be prepared for the pain =)"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Having succumbed to the media hype about this book, I bought a copy at Costco. I wasted my money.Don't mistake this for quality writing, or look for any quality of imagination. This has none of the scope of Tolkein, which it tries to emulatle without success. It has none of the richness and versimilitude of Rowling. The situations are banal, the battles are silly, the characters are wooden. Out of deference to the critics who liked the book, I kept reading, waiting to figure out why they had praised it. I can only assume it is because of the age of the author. But that can't, and doesn't, make this a good read. And nothing in the book itself does.The attempts to create suspense are painful to watch. Mr. Paolini should read some Stephen King or watch some Hitchcock to see how to create suspense. The character development is minimal at best. Most fantasy depends on unlikely and unexplained coincidences, but these are so unlikely as to be laughable.If you are a fantasy addict and need new books to feed your addiction, I suppose this is no worse than most other fantasy being published today, though you would be advised to wait until it comes out in paperback. But if you're looking for a good read, skip this one."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Forst off, anyone who review this book as a Lord of the Rings knock off is not a true fantasty reader and LoR is probably the only book they've read (maybe Harry Potter~WOW). This book is mediocre at buts, Paolini has potential but he writes like he is still in his Advanced Placement Lang&Comp. class in high scool. I would also like to point out that he DIRECTLY lifted from Robin Hobbs Assassins trilogy, Paolini may as well have descriped the charcters as \\"witted\\", and \\"skilled.\\" I also noticed a few pulls from the great George RR Martin far more than Tolkien. But who doesnt pull from Tolkien, dont tell me David Eddings write originals. As for the book, its what they call in Lit. a \\"Mary Sue,\\" its like a fanfiction in which the author imposes hims self as the infallible protagonist stricken with unproventable tragedy. It is the most common type of amature writing, every true writer has done it. This will pass as it does in all practiced writers and the potential of this author will become a realty. Earagon is riddled with all those vocab word you took tests on in english and forgot and is inconsitent in tone. Despite its downfalls, while its far from original, the plot is strong and the narritive is fluid, though humanistic character development would have helped though. I dont blame paolini for his novels mediocrity as it could be expect, but rather the editor sacrificed characters and feeling for the bread and butter stereotypes that plauge the genre all the while forgetting the basics of correcting implausiblities. I would also point out that this is a CHILDRENS novel and should be treated as such and was not written for the same people that an Edding writes. For what it is there is promise and i was not too unbearable to finish. I recomed you borrow the book or check it out of the library, its not worth it to buy it."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"The novel is ok, but I can't praise it for its originality or characters. The plot is often convenient, predictable, and obviously taken from other books. The ending does not satisfy the reader, and the lack of consistent character development becomes annoying as characters suddenly grow and then revert to earlier behaviors.I have to agree with everyone criticizing the book's writing style. I know the author is just beginning, but he needs several writing courses. His sentences lack variety and the book needs much more attention to editing.As a family published novel, the book is impressive; however, as a work in mainstream publication, the work suffers from a weak tone, bad grammar, and a standard plot."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I have never read a book I had such crossed feelings about. On the one hand it seemed to use far too much Tolkein: elves dwarves, dragons. And guess what; the main charactor Eragon falls in love with an elf called Arya, hmm, what does this instantly remind me of, oh yeah Tolkein again, Aragorn and Arwen, I mean come on, the names are half the same.On the other hand it had a pretty decent plot and brilliant description and being an aspiring fifteen year old author myself, I can't help but be spurred on by the fact that this book was published by a author that started writing at the same time as myself. Christopher Paolini comes across as a amateur writer, despite his wide vocabluary, who wants nothing more than to be thought of as the new Tolkein."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Join Eragon, a young Rider, on a great quest for revenge against the Empire. When his uncle is mysteriously killed, and he finds a dragon egg, he knows something is different about him. He leaves his home to pursue his uncle's murderers, but will he survive?I think this book is one of the best I've read, mostly because of the action, but also because of the rich storyline filled with many new monsters and evils. Hats off to Christopher Paolini, the young writer of this fabulous novel. This is a great book for any reader, the Harry Potter fans that can't wait for the next book, and the Lord of the Rings fans that want a next book. It has the magic of Harry Potter and the action of Lord of the Rings."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Fifteen-year-old Eragon believes that he is merely a poor farm boy-until his destiny as a Dragon Rider is revealed. Gifted with only an ancient sword, a loyal dragon, and sage advice from an old storyteller, Eragon is soon swept into a dangerous tapestry of magic, glory, and power. Now his choices could save-or destroy-the Empire.If you have a thirst for Fantasy and Adventure, then your quench will love Eragon. Christopher Paolini is the best author and I HAVE met him in person!![...]"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"After reading Eragon, I have concluded that it was one of the best books I've ever read. It was amazingly written; I've read books by adults who couldn't even compete with Paolini's technique/style. This book was full of such extreme detail that I felt like I was living through Eragon. I was blown away by this book.However, I have found that many people think that Eragon was a sloppy piece of writing. Some have said that Eragon cried and fainted too much. I suppose you would cry too if you lost the people you loved! And, as I read in another review, there IS a difference between fainting and getting knocked out.Another fact that I have picked up is that people think that Eragon was put together by copying from other works of writing, such as the Lord of the Rings trilogy. I strongly oppose this; writers can get their inspiration from other things, but their work is entirely their own. The fact that a teenager wrote this book and had it published is amazing! It takes skill to write even the worst book and have it published, and to write something this good when he was only 15...it's just beyond words.Overall, this was an amazing book. It was refreshing to read such a wonderful, lengthy fantasy novel. This was a great book to immerse oneself in, and I find that it was an excellent start to what I'm sure will be an excellent series."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I've not finished this book. I've not finished the third chapter. I've heard such great things about this book, one of my best friends went so far as to call it \\"like the best book ever.\\" So far, I've found it well written but intensely dull. I'm willing to give it a second chance however, as long as it gets better. If its anything near as good as \\"Abarat\\" which I'd consider the best fantasy book of my generation, than it's going to get a lot better from this point."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Don't listen to everyone else, this book is really amazing. I found the plot extremely addictive and the characters extremely real. I don't care what other people say, i thought the plot was original. Sure, it involved dragons and warfare, but what true fantasy book doesn't? I don't consider that \\"stealing\\" as others have.i really loved this book. If you can't get into it, just stay with it and wait for the plot to unravel a bit. I found myself sitting in school anxious to get home to finish the book.The only downside was Christopher's age. There were some points where I felt the sentences could use a little rearranging - although i am merely 17 myself.Overall though, i would highly recommend this book. I am eagerly awaiting the arrival of the second one, as this one left me thirsty for answers."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I really did enjoy reading this book. It was fun, has some good mythology, and cool characters that I can't wait to see how they develop in future volumes. But there is the one problem that makes me hesitate in giving Eragon the full five stars and even in giving it four stars.When I was younger I read authors like Tolkein, Brian Jacques, C.S. Lewis, Lyod Alexader, and other similar authors. I wanted to write a fantasy epic, just like these great writters. However, I was young, and could never really get away from their influence. I always ended up quiting because I felt I was making my story too much like Lord of the Rings, or Black Cauldron, or even the movie Willow. It upset me that I could never have my own story free and different from these great writters of fantasy. I also began to see how recent novels of the past few years are similar to the older ones, and I was prevented from liking those books as much as I should. When I read Eragon, I kept thinking over certain points. Like with the Urgals, Paolini's monsters, I couldn't help but think \\"Orcs! Rip-off!\\" These monsters even have an elite group of warriors like the Uruk-Hai from LOTR. But these were orginal creatures. There are original aspects of this book, but veterans of the works of the authors I've mentioned might focus too much on the similarities to older books.Paolini has written what I think is the very best fantasy novel in the past five years. He's set up the rest of his Inheritance saga very well. But like in my attempts at writting, he cannot escape the shadow of the legendary fantasy writters. Even the name of the main character invokes thoughts of Tolkein.But perhaps the similarities are what makes this book so enjoyable. Its very heartening to see some write fantasy so well that we immediatly think of people like Tolkein or Lewis. Please don't let my silly little problem with the book prevent you from not reading it. This is an excellent book, and most people will enjoy reading it over and over again. My criticsm comes only because I'm a nerd who has read too many fantasy novels. Give it a shot, and don't just immediatly blow it off as a Tolkein rip-off."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I listened to this book on audiotape with my family while we were on a long car trip. The kids shut off the DVD, preferring to listen to the tape instead. The story was intersting and moved enough to help us stay awake while traveling. The tapes are so well done that two of the kids have listened to it again once we got home. I plan repeating Eragon this winter when I have more driving to do. My 5 and 6 year olds enjoyed it almost as much as the teenager and adults. The only other audiotapes we listen to more than once are the Harry Potter tapes, so we think it's a winner."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I'll admit, this book was pretty well written for a 15 year old but its really just copied from LOTR and pasted back together. I mean, come on! Arya is like Arwen, Brom is like Gandalf, and Eragon is.... well that's so easy that i don't even need to put it on! now, it would be great if the characters had a little more detail and personality. also this was so predictable at times! get some creativity writers!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This book is one of the best books I have ever read. True, there are some pseudo-plagiarisms, but nothing is completely copied. Christopher Paolini was only 18 when he wrote this, but his writing could be from an experienced writer of 40+ years of age. The storyline is immaculately picked over and crystal clear. You rarely get confused on anything because he puts so much detail into his work that you probably would never get confused unless he meant for it to be confusing. This masterpiece that Christopher Paolini has created will still be read for countless years to come."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"The best book ever?!?!!?!? kinda... though lots of things REALLY resembled parts of the Lord of the Rings. The most of it was exciting and kept u guessing. I didn't really realize that it was similar 2 Lord os the rings till i was done reading it so it doesn't resemble it THAT much. This was a non-stop thriller i couldn't put it down i finished it in # days. It's very appropriate too. I'm reading it to my 6 year old brother. I'd recomend it 4 buying and it's a great thing that you'll enjoy reading time and time again!!!1"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This book is one of the best I have ever ead. For those of you who are truly hardcore fantasy readers, this may not be for you. However, I am just beginning my trek into the world of fantasy fiction and this was an incredible read for me. I purchased the book and finished it in 3-4 days. The pace is excellent (not a lot of down time), the detail is plenty but not overpowering, and the story line is fun and engaging (even if it is a bit stereotypical). I can't wait for the second book in the series to arrive."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I liked this book very much. I think it is a good book because it is interesting.

I bought it for a normal read, only for entertainment, but it really ended being one of my favorite books ever. The plot is strong enough to sustain al the events and the characters have pressence and are well described. The story of this Eragon and his travel to maturity when he finds a dragon egg is deep and interesting. Probably there are some mistakes in writing, but the author is only 17 (very young to write such a good story), so this is understanded easily. The feelings and toughts of the main character, the young Rider Eragon, are well explained, althought Paolini wrote almost everything Eragon thinked, which takes a good part of the expectation away from the story. Is also great how Paolini writes the drastic change that Eragon had to sustain, from being a simple farm boy, to opposing the same Empire in which he had lived all his life and being the only one able to defeat the evil king of Alagaesia, Galbatorix. There is also some aproximations to a new language (there is some kind of a guide to this language in the book), but this one is very far away to reach what Tolkien made with his Tengwar and the Darwf runes.At the end, this book is full of elves ,dwarfs and humans, the universe Tolkien created and that has inspired a lot of authors to create their masterpieces, but it makes up an excellent read and it introduces a race, the most misterious of all: the dragons and their Riders, the only means for the salvation of Alagaesia."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Fantasy is not what I usually read, but I kept seeing this book and decided to pick it up. Christopher Paolini did an extraordinary job at writing this fantastic book - no matter how old he was when he wrote it! Very fluid writing, kept me interested enough to keep reading.

Excellent job!!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I havn't finished this book yet, But I think this is a great book!!

As a book held up to the light of classics by Lewis, Tolkein and others, however, I cannot see how it made the New York Times bestseller except for the fact that it was written by a teen. It's your typical Cinderella story. I'm not trying to be harsh--it's well written, but it is one of the most OBVIOUS Tolkien plagerisms out there!! Don't buy this book, borrow it at a library...Other than the plagerism the book itself is written very well..."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"It is amazing that a 15 year old, now older, wrote such a long compelling story. However, it reads like a teenager wrote it at times and does not stand against the imagination of Harry Potter stories and the genius of \\"Lord of the Rings\\". It would have been nice to see some more originality.That said, it is a story worth reading and I definitely am hooked enough to read the Eldest book. I am hoping and optomistic to see improvement by this remarkable young writer."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I've been working with kids quite a bit lately, and one of them walked in with Eldest, the second book in the Inheritance trilogy. He was so engrossed by the book, I picked up Eragon to get a flavor of Paolini's series, and to see how it compares to my favorite fantasy series by C.S. Lewis, J.R. Tolkien, and Lloyd Alexander.First, Eragon is a great read. At first, I felt that Paolini was using big words and giving descriptions that were too detailed as he tested out his own writing gifts and began exploring his fantasy world. By the middle of the book, I was hooked. The relationship between the Dragon Rider, Eragon, and his dragon was very new for me as a fantasy concept. Also, the idea that magic saps the strength of its practicitoners and that magical battle is primarily a contest of will rather than skill is a deep fantasy concept for me. Without giving the story away, I felt that there was enough action and strong enough characters to make this high quality fantasy.Like other reviewers have said, this series is not really going over radically new ground. I'm not familiar with the Dragon Riders of Pern series, but I am familiar with Tolkien and I can see much of his Middle Earth in this work. Dwarves, elves, and humans play similar roles. The evil Shade is very much a parallel to the undead Kings in Fellowship of the Ring. Tolkien writes a classic series. Paolini may be in the process of forming a classic series, but I'm not sure whether Inheritance has enough new elements to make it a classic and a trailblazer in the fantasy field. For now, I accept it as a readable, enjoyable tale to follow-up the recent megastardom of Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings. I'm not sure if I'll continue reading the series, but I'm glad I spent time with this book and I wish Paolini the best.3.5 stars--SD"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I was getting so bored reading about usual dragon books, either the dragon kills a human and there is a quest for revenge, or the humans do the same to the dragon and its the same thing. Then a friend of mine recomended this book called Eragon, which some of my classmates had been reading. I can't wit for the third one, which will probably be better then the others."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I liked the book Eragon because it's a great book with action, suspense, and all the other things that make a story great. For example, when Paolini describes Eragon fighting the Urgals, a humanoid creature, I felt like I was in the book. He explains the action like no other author.In this book a farm boy named Eragon finds an egg that hatches to be a dragon. He goes on a journey to be a dragon rider. While traveling, he learns to use magic and to sword fight. To find all the stories details read the book.The beginning is very slow but once you get past that, the story is amazing. I would recommend this book to good readers and fantasy lovers."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I thought this book was great. Eveyone is saying that Christopher Paolini copied and everything but that doesn't really get in the way of it being a great book. The plot and characters are a bit noticably familiar, but I still thought that this book was fantastic. I didn't like the way Eragon's character was always changing and the fact that he didn't think about riding his dragon across the desert. I believe that I even saw an editing mistake. That isn't really surprising since his family edited it.I read this book because the cover seemed fairly interesting and I love fantasy-fiction. This book turned out better than I expected but you can't change the fact that it's a LOT like LotR and I've also heard Star Wars."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I really never knew that a 19 year old could be so creative, i am only 15 and that was the most amazing book i have ver read, it even beats lord of the rings!!!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This is a great book.

You have your standard young person of humble station getting a big fat destiny landing in his lap, and running off into the unknown with a mystierious aged tutor and pursued by terrible enemies.But it is still a very enjoyable read and I stayed up until 3am to finish it. There's a lot to like about Eragon, especially the portrayal of magic (which differs somewhat from most other works I've read).But what's all this talk about it being like LOTR? Eliminate the similarities you find in nearly ALL fantasy, and the two are really quite different. And the stories are very different as well.A fun read. Keeps you up at night. Want more. That's all you need to know."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Christopher Paolini has written a book that showcases his potential for producing some truly great fantasy stories in the future. While reading this book, I found myself constantly comparing the plot and character development to other authors. This was not always a bad thing, however, because in some instances Paolini actually improves upon other authors' ideas and writing styles. For example, in scenes that dealt with interaction between Eragon and his dragon, Saphira, of course Anne McCaffrey's Pern stories immediately came to mind. But, I was impressed by Paolini's inclusion of his own original details- and found myself thinking that those extra details were the things I always wanted to know when reading the Pern books, but was never given by McCaffrey.The only time I was really disgusted by a borrowed idea was near the end of the book, when Paolini unashamedly rips off Ursula LeGuin's Earthsea novels nearly word for word in discussing the nature of magic, with regard to the Language of the Making (which dragons inherently know and humans must strive to learn); and the idea that every thing and being has a name in the Language of the Making that if known, gives others power over that thing or being. The only twist Paolini gives to the idea is that humans must discover their name (while LeGuin's characters are given their name in a coming of age ritual).I believe Paolini's next book in the series will serve to define the greatness of \\"Eragon\\". I fear that the potential is there for the story to degenerate into a painfully drawn out \\"Wheel of Time\\" series. However, if Paolini disciplines himself and keeps his writing fresh and interesting, \\"Eragon\\" will be a commendable first effort that serves as a springboard to other truly great books."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Anyone who enjoys LOTR/Harry Potter-esque books, young or old will enjoy Eragon.

Although it has many similarities to Lord of the Rings, it still has its many good points. Paolini is a young writer who deeply describes the story and creates an understandable story line.

At least, that's how it always struck me. Tolkien, Brooks, and McCaffrey have influenced a load of people, most likely each other as well, and that's exactly what makes this piece utterly uncreative.

The charactors were so much like LOTR. I felt like this book was too slow paced and lacked action. It also had a very loose story line and lacked any epic feeling. I also felt that is was hard to love the charectors. They all(old or young) had the heart of a 15 year old. Brom,the old wise rider, lacked the wiseness that charectors such as Gandalf had.

It's one of the few books I've read lately that left me wanting more. The characters are all incredibly deep, and the story is so packed with plot it's amazing.If you enjoy Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings, you can bet you'll enjoy this."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I have been told that there are only seven stories that exist and every story after that is just one of the original seven with a twist. I say this because of the numerous reviews that compare this story to Star Wars or LOTR. I did not see those comparisons as accurate. Yes Eragon comes from a farm, but in the fantasy realm, who doesn't? I also did not see the blatant rip off of Tolkien. Yes there are elves and dwarves and the like, however what fantasy realm is void of such creatures? I don't think the inclusion of such things should be held against the author, for taking elves and dwarves out of fantasy is like taking space ships and aliens out of science fiction.There are basically two ways to review this book: One is from the age range of 10 - 16 years and the other is for the adult and advanced reader. Now when I say advanced reader, I do not mean to sound like an elitist, but there is a big difference between finding pleasure in Harry Potter as opposed to Clive Barker.Anyway - from the perspective of the young adult (I used to be one once), this is a pretty good book. It is simple and includes all the basics of a good fantasy novel. The story does not get bogged down and flows well enough for someone who has yet to really experience a fantasy book. This is a good introduction to what fantasy is and I think young readers will enjoy it. I would also suggest, however, picking up a copy of the original Dragonlance series. That was my introduction into fantasy and is one of the best and longest living fantasy worlds around.From the advanced reader's perspective, I think the problem with this book from our angle is the same thing that makes it good for the young readers - it is too basic. If you have been sharpening your imagination on the likes of Jordan, Martin or Goodkind, then the simplicity of this story will bother you. Additionally, the book was written by a 15 year old. Now that alone is a pretty good accomplishment, but when it was placed on mass market for sale, it was placed among all other novels and should not be given lee way simply because the author was young. A good book is good and a bad book is bad and the age of the writer should not sway the review.At times, while reading this, it was obvious the writer was 15. Some of the dialogue between characters was shallow and out of place. In spite of his anger towards Urgals and slavers, Eragons distaste for killing them seems out of place - and his anger at a travel mate for doing so seems equally as odd and inconsistent.Additionally, the Urgals and Kulls are billed as being tough monster who are hard to kill (stated as it would take 8 men to kill a Kull) yet at the end they seem to fall like dominoes. A small inconsistency but one nonetheless.Overall, the book is good for kids, but probably should not be read by adults who are used to this genre. I think young readers should start with this and move into the Dragonlance saga while advanced readers should simply avoid this and stick with the three I mentioned above.- Go Irish!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Thats how I felt reading this book. There were times I really liked it and other times when I was bored. Paolini didn't pace his book very well. But he was 15 when he wrote it so you have to forgive it for some things. The biggest problem I have is how it ripped off every fantasty book out there, mainly Lord of the Rings, especially the names:Ayra-ArwenEragon-AragornI mean come on I could come up with more original names. It still has some good elements though, the characters are good for the most part. The only character that had no point was Angela.She just randomely appears wherever Eragon goes. Stalker anyone. But she could have been elimanated easily and cut down on some pages, he needs a new editor for sure.Overall its good for a 15 year old but its still flounders and dies in its own sentences and long pages. Read if your a huge fan of fantasty only."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Eragon is amazing! The best fantasy book ever! If you like: Harry Potter - The Lord of the Rings - Artemis Fowl - Enders Game and any other fantasy books you'll love Eragon! The sequel is called Eldest and the third and last book of the trilogy (probably called Empire) is yet to come out. I'm almost 20 years old and as you can tell in love with Eragon and Eldest. I've read Eragon 3 times and Eldest twice. Also my 11 and 13 year old brothers have read them several times over, so they really are for all ages. Read this book and I promise you won't regret it. Look for Eragon the movie to hit theaters December 15th 2006. But please read the book first!!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Hello there everyone! I like this book because it has a lot of adventure in it. You get to read about spells, wars, and it's all with a medevil time period that makes it awesome. An interesting thing about the book is how as it goes from one place to another.You can visualize it on the maps in the front and back of the books. It's a good book because it's mature but not boring but not childish at the same time.cIn the beggining, an elf gets ambushed and sends a package she has to some small town. Eragon, a 15 year-old boy, finds it while hunting in the woods. It ends up being a stone but is a dragon egg that soon hatches changing Eragon's life. He keeps it all a secret but when evil men, Ra'Zac, are in town and find out they kill Garrow, Eragon's uncle, and destroy their house. He then goes on adventures with Brom, a dragon storyteller, to avenge his uncle by kiing the Ra'Zac. On their jouney Eragon lerans that since he has obtained a dragon he has now become a Dragon Rider. Brom then teaches him how to fight with a sword as well as magic. When they find the Ra'Zac, theygot ambushed by them and Brom took an arrow for Eragon and died. Then a man named Murtagh saves Eragon and his dragon, Saphria, from the Ra'Zac. While riding with his new companion, in the night they are attcked and Eragon got captured and sent to imprisonment. Then Murtagh and Saphria rescue him and a girl from a Shade, an evil warrior, and escape the prison. Later they find out she's an elf that's been badly wounded so they bring her to the Varden, a rebel army, to heal her. While there Eragon finds out that Murtagh is the son of an evil rider who served the king. Murtagh is against the empire and helps serve the Varden. After the elf, Arya, is treated she is now fully recovered thanks to Eragon. Then a war breaks out in the middle of the night between the defending Varden and an army of Urgals. Urgals are crude beasts that Eragon has encountered along his travels in small numbers but defeated them. Now they have also Kull, a much larger and stronger species of Urgals. Will Eragon survive this wicked battle or will one of his close allies perish to and Urgal attacker? Read further to find the answers to jam-packed ending. Trust me it's gonna be good!Any reader who likes midevil, adventure, or fantasy would love this book. Especially if they like all three! The book has adventure fro mEragon battleing Urgals and escaping the empire. Midevil times because of the sword battles and horseback riding. Fantasy! Thgere's awesome spells and magic unlike wand curses from \\"Harry Potter\\". It's a little dark of a book and more complicated making it unsuitable for childrem 10 and under. The author has a descriptive imagination by writing the persise details about Eragon's adventures. I personally enjoyed this book down to evry last word. Also it has a setup for a sequal without making it a cliff hanger and is already in the making. I hope everyone is going to and read this book did and will enjoy it just as much as i did."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I read this book in two days. I just couldn't put it down. I had waited for months to get a copy of this from the local library and it was well worth the wait. I would recommend this book to teens as well as adults.

Waiting for the right person to come and claim it but, it must choose carefully for its fate depends on the person who picks it up. Soon, the answer comes right into the forest: Eragon. Finding the stone he takes it home. But it is not a stone but an egg! Several days later, the egg hatches into a beautiful blue dragon, one of whose race is nearly extinct and is named after another dragon. The dragon is named: Saphira. Eragon soon realizes that this dragon is wanted terribly by the Empire and his price of learning this is the death of a very close family member. Together, with the help of unlikely friends, Eragon and Saphira journey, becoming one and becoming what Eragon's fate has always been: A Dragon Rider.Eragon is a great story of never giving up when you feel like there is nothing else you can do. Paolini binds together an epic story of Elves, Dwarves, Shades, Urgals and many fantasy creatures and species while following Eragon and Saphira on an incredible journey. As you start the book, you are suddenly grasped into a different world that you live n. Christopher Paolini creates a realistic scenes making you part of the story.Eragon is detailed, full of action and grabs the readers' attention almost making them not want to stop.

The characters are vivid and imaginative and draw you into the epic of a boy who struggles to raise a dragon outside the clutches of the Empire. Saphira, the dragon, takes my breath away, and I could feel the deep empathy she has with her rider.

It is the first part of a trilogy that examines the rise of a new dragonrider named Eragon. Eragon is a farm boy who lives with his uncle, Garrow, and older cousin, Roran, out in the country outside of the rural village of Carvahall near a treacherous mountain pass known as The Spine. Eragon's mother gave Eragon to Garrow to raise shortly after he was born and then left. Eragon never met either of his parents. Near the beginning of the story, Eragon is hunting wild game in The Spine when he discovers a large, oval sapphire stone. Eragon believes that the stone might be valuable and brings it back with him. He attempts to sell it in town but no one will purchase it after learning it was discovered in The Spine because the Spine is a wicked place full of magic. Eventually, the stone hatches and Eragon discovers that the stone was a dragon egg. Speaking with a local storyteller known as Brom, Eragon names the dragon Saphira. The seasons change and Eragon keeps Saphira hidden, afraid to tell Garrow or Roran about his discovery and his growing mental connection to the dragon. Roran leaves the farm to establish himself so that he can marry the woman he loves, Katrina. Not long after Roran leaves, rumors reach Carvahall of troop movements and strange creatures, the Ra'zac, seeking the stone Eragon discovered months before. Eragon races back to the farm, but is carried away by Saphira. Eragon later discovers the body of Garrow and the farm house destroyed. Knowing that he is a wanted man by the Empire, Eragon decides that he will seek out the Ra'zac, kill them, and set forth to join the freedom fighters called the Varden. As he seeks to leave the village is stopped and then joined by Brom. Brom isn't exactly the simple storyteller that he appears to be. During their journey, Brom begins instructing Eragon in the ways of armed combat and magic and reveals to Eragon that he is a new Dragon Rider, chosen by Saphira herself. Their journey takes them from one end of Algaesia to the other and Eragon finds himself involved in a grand adventure and struggle that is beyond even his imagination.ERAGON has become a bestseller and has been hailed by some as a new classic of fantasy. I first became acquainted with the book through working with middle school students and decided to finally read the book after having seen the film adaptation in December 2006.As many others have pointed out, ERAGON is highly derivative of many other works, from Tolkien's LORD OF THE RINGS to George Lucas' original STAR WARS to stories of Ursula le Guin. I knew about this before I began reading the book, but I tried not to let that knowledge how I felt about the overall story.Despite the derivative nature of the novel, I enjoyed ERAGON. The book is around 500 pages in length, but I read the story in just a few days. I became so enraptured with the action of the story that I found it difficult to put the book down. Christopher Paolini was a teenager when he began writing the book (as discussed in the acknowledgements) and I think that overall he succeeded at writing an exciting piece of fantasy. Besides being derivative, the story has some other minor flaws, such as a lack of characterization and at times instead of reading like a work of fantasy the story seems to read more like a screenplay. Personally, these things didn't bother me all that much and neither did the derivative nature of the story. Storytellers, authors, and filmmakers have been ripping of each other since the second campfire after the first story was told.ERAGON is full of elements, devices, and structure taken from a wide variety of sources. I can understand why that might be a problem with some people, but for me it wasn't much of an issue. It seems to me that the author tried to tie together various elements from a wide variety of literature and stories that he enjoyed and unite them in a world where they would co-exist together. That does make the story unimaginative at times, but it still makes for a decent yarn nevertheless. Besides, ERAGON is at its core a hero quest and the elements of that type of story are ancient (read THE HERO WITH A THOUSAND FACES)."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I already know what most of the negative comments exuding from critics are going to be, the book is vague, its extremely predictable, it is a copy of works written by far better authors, the book has no originality, and when reading it one can tell it was written by a teenager. All of these comments are true, but who cares! The book is an exciting read and it was intended for a teenage audience to begin with. I'am 21 years old and i have read a little bit of every thing from Herman Hesse to Ernest Hemmingway, from Dostoevsky to Nietzsche, and from Kalil Gabron to Isabel Allende to JRR Tolken, these are just a few of the authors i've enjoyed and every one of them has written something special that has brought me Joy and insight, there is no reason to judge young Paolini so harshly as he is just starting his career and is showing great progress in his writing, i have enjoyed his contributions to litterature and i hope to one day make a contribution of my own, though i hope that there won't be a subsequence of misguided criticism following the release of my novel.... Either way i would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys the fantasy genre, you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Eragon is an excellent book that I would recomend for a teenaged kid who likes a good fantasy read.

This book is pretty much a cauldron of books thrown together. Not only that, but the descriptions and dialogue are so boring and predictable, you could fall asleep. The main character is also supposed to be bright, but he is surprisingly stupid, and it does not help the story. I am a MAJOR fan of Tolkien and the similarities between that book and Eragon, and Eldest are astounding. I mean, just looking at the map, Furnost, Melian, Hadarac Desert umm I wonder where he got that from? LETS SEE!FORNOST, MELIAN THE MAIA, and HARAD!!! Its apalling at what this guy has written.

Stupid me I bought both books. I felt obligated to read them because I paid too much for the books to quit? I feel so embarrassed because I've been gushing about the books even though I never read them."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"In Eragon, orphan farmboy Eragon discovers a dragon egg, befriends the dragon that emerges from it, and learns from a mysterious mentor, Brom, about the nearly forgotten legacy of the Dragon Riders.Eragon is a book written by a 15-year-old. And it reads just like a book written by a 15-year-old. It suffers from uneven characterization, generally flat characters, and an episodic plot that wore on my patience. The dialogue was frequently awkward, and sometimes I felt Paolini was trying to write how he thought a fantasy writer should, instead of writing from his own gut. In short, the things that are overlooked, like depth of characterization, are just the sort of thing you would expect someone that young to overlook.Much seems to be made of Paolini's relative originality. While, yes, every fantasy story under the sun derives some elements from common tropes, themes, creatures, character types, or conventions, good fantasy writers make those elements their own. Paolini was not able to put his own stamp on such things as the inexperienced youth who discovers he's destined for great things, or the mentor/sage, or the race of elves.If the writing were stronger and conveyed a more convincing depth of emotion, the derivative nature of the book could be more easily passed over. Instead, it often feels as though Paolini is paraphrasing descriptions of emotions and characters that he's read before, but without feeling or understanding them himself. Thus there is no overwhelming strength--aside from potential for Paolini to develop into a good writer in the future--to couteract Eragon's present flaws.There were some nice descriptive passages, and the relationship between Eragon and his dragon, Saphria, was truly enjoyable, despite cipher hero Eragon's tepidness (and the logical flaw that if Saphria is as wise and understanding as she is mere weeks after hatching, why do dragons need riders at all?).Credit is often given for the novel being written by 'only' a 15-year-old, but while that accomplishment itself is notable, the product itself lacks maturity--for which perhaps the publisher/editor is as much to blame as the author--and there are better books, with much better writing, in this genre to be had both for kids' and adults' reading."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I'm writing this from a parents point of view. First of all, let me say I agree with the reviewer who said you should encourage your kids to read whatever the book is (within reason of course--no 5 year old needs to be reading the \\"Anarchist's Cookbook\\").That being said, I think you could do a lot better than \\"Eragon\\" in choosing a book for the young fantasy fan in your life. I've worked in publishing for about 15 years, and this book would never have made it out of the slush pile at the company I worked for. Mr. Paolini is simply not a very good writer, and his style is a poor example for children. The story is indeed as derivative as all of the reviewers who actually put some thought into their reasing have stated, and hisp ortrayl of females is downright non-existant (I'm sure a product of Mr. Paolini's own lack of familiarity with this subject at the time of his writing--he was an adolescent after all).I wouldn't recommend this book to any young person I know, or to any parent. This is the muzak version of a Beatles tune, or the Sci-Fi Channel version of Frank Herbert's books. Nice try---but it doesn't cut the mustard. Perhaps Mr. Paolini should find a new career. I'm shocked he's made it this far on his lack of talent."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Save your money and buy Harry Potter.

Zero stars!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I was very much looking forward to reading this book but found it a grave dissapointment. I agree with many points made by the other reviewers who were not pleased with Eragon. I might add to those comments that JK Rowling is a good example of an author who, although extremely derivative of all fantasy novels which came before her, weaved these old ideas in a new and fresh and fun way. The characters in Eragon are stock and do not exhibit realistic development. Rather they simply fit right into new and fantastic roles given to them with the greatest of ease (ie: Eragon changing from farm boy to magic-wielding dragon rider in what seems like no time at all). I believe that Mr. Paolino could one day be a very good writer, but he needs to look at the mistakes made, both creatively and dramatically, in this first endeavour."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I purchased a signed copy of Eragon from the author at the Northwest Bookfest last month in Seattle. I was intruiged by this young man dressed in a Renaissance-era outfit. He was personable and talked me into getting a book. How could I not buy his book? It's not every day you meet an 18 year old who has a book published.I read the first two chapters while eating at the Bookfest. I brought the book home and my children, 8 and 10, wanted to know what the book with the blue eye was. That night I read the first two chapters to them as their bedtime story. They wanted me to keep reading. Instead, I promised to read Eragon to them each night.That was two weeks ago. I have held myself back from jumping ahead to find out what adventure Eragon, Brom, and Saphira have next, so I can read to the children their bedtime story.Soft light shines into their bedroom while Eragon is read. The children never want me to stop reading. From dinnertime to bedtime, they constantly are asking when can we go upstairs to our bedroom to hear the next installment of Eragon.The children are so taken with Eragon and Christopher Paolini, they ask questions about who he is, where he lives, what he eats, what color pen or pencil does he write with, does he use a computer? They never stop.When I read to them at night, Eragon is a novel in technicolor. We all see the story in our mind's eye. I feel like I go about my daily business with an Eragon DVD inserted into my head.I want to know how Eragon finishses, but we are savoring each chapter like fine wine.

I'm not going to fall back on that annoying cliche and say that it's a waste of trees, but it certainly IS a waste of my time, as a jaded fantasy veteran.I honestly have to laugh at all of the reviews stating how 'original' Eragon is and how many 'twists' Paolini put on the subject of dragons, magic, etc etc. HELLO? Go read Eddings, Jordan, and especially Tolkein and McCaffrey - and THEN we'll see if you can talk. And no, you won't be able to, because you'll finally realize how much of a ripoff this pitiful book is.The horrible, deritive plot aside, +Paolini relies far too heavily on metaphors. The sentences are awkward, and one moment Eragon will be speaking 'grandly' (albeit ridiculously) and the next he'll sound like some kid from the 21st century. The characters are all paper-thin - truly cardboard cutouts. I could not find one interesting character, except for Angela, who at least had a little redeeming originality and depth. And most of all - what's up with Eragon? He's the whiniest, dullest, most annoying protagonist I've ever had to struggle through 500+ pages with.Half the time I truly wanted to set Saphira's dainty little blue tail on fire. Paolini apparently attempted to make her the 'ultimate' best friend - and failed miserably. Witty, intelligent, caring, warm, sympathetic?

From the poor orphaned farm boy who gets swept up into an exciting adventure, to the completely predictable dragons, dwarves and elves, to the Star Wars-esque evil empire and resitance movement, to the appearance of the white bearded wizardly mentor (tm), it seems as if every single stale fantasy cliche gets trotted out and pressed into service. This is a book composed of stock characters and overused plot points in an entirely typical and unimaginative pseudo-medieval fantasy setting. Anyone looking for a good YA fantasy novel would probably be better off with something by Diana Wynne Jones, Garth Nix, Tamora Pierce, Phillip Pullman, J.K.

Get over yourselves -- It's a fantastic read! And maybe the similarities stem from the fact that the biggies in this genre aren't very deep in themselves when it comes to plot devices and conflicts -- they all boil down to good v. evil, don't they?

(You might not, if you don't really understand the beauty of suspense, the pleasure of exitement, and the taste of adventure).If you are of the kind that grabs a good book and sees it as one, understands the complexity of rich language, and is ready to take that book everywhere, that book might just be \\"Eragon\\".It really doesn't matter what age you are, so long as you can read and understand a few complex and hard terms that might pop up. I think anyone that can read, should read it.Don't be surprised if you don't like it. I warn you: there is no law about tastes. But if you're like me, you'll be marked with \\"I read Eragon, by Christopher Paolini\\" for the rest of your life.Jimena Novaro, age 12"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I read this book because my uncle gave the book to me, and I thought it would be a good book to read. It is a very good book that is full of dragons, magic and adventure. Eragon a poor farmer boy, is hunting where he finds a strange rock, and takes it back home. A month later, a dragon, hatches from the stone. Secretly Eragon starts taking care of the dragon, one day strangers come into town and in days, his life changes. He runs away with a friend, who found Eragon's dragon in hiding and joins as they try and find the murders of Eragon's uncle. Eragon end's up fighting in a war. It is a very good book and I want to read the next one!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I love fantasy books more than any other genre, and this book reinforced that. Eragon is about a young man who lives with his cousin and his uncle. One day while he is hunting, an explosion occurs out of nowhere and scares off all of the game that he has been tracking for days. He looks at the explosion and notices that it is not of natural origin. Well, as natural as explosive devices can get, anyway. Eragon (that's his name!) finds a beautiful sapphire stone among the charred plants. He is wary of it at first, but since he didn't get any game, he takes the stone and, surprised at it's weight, puts it into his bag, thinking that he might trade it for meat at the butcher's shop. You become entranced with the book and you can't put it down! It goes on to talk about the Dragon Riders and Eragon can't help but think of the wierd stone. He later finds that it is not a stone as he had thought, but rather, a dragon egg. It hatches and grows, and as the dragon gets older, Eragon speaks with the local storyteller, Brom, to see what he can learn about dragons. What Eragon doesn't realize is that the dragon will put not only himself, but his family, in danger. I give this book five stars because it keeps you interested the entire time you're reading it. If you love fantasy (magic and dragons included) then you will love this book. Trust me on this... I'm almost positive that you won't be able to put it down until you're done reading it!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This book by Christopher Paolini is one of the best books I ever read. It is about a farm boy named Eragon, a skilled hunter who finds a cold blue stone in the haunted forest, The Spine. Never did he know that this blue stone, was a dragon egg, and that he'd be the next dragon rider. His life changed dramatically as the egg hatches, his Uncle Garrow dies by the Ra'Zac, and a mind full of revenge in his mind. He sets out for a wild journey with his dragon, which he named Saphira with the help of Brom, an unknown storyteller and accompanies Eragon in his journey. Eragon meets many new friends and a whole new world unveils itself.I really enjoyed and loved this book so much that I read it over 5 times over again, and It will never stop being such a great adventure for me. It has always been my favorite book and will never stop being my favorite. Although I haven't read any of the Tolkien books, I think book is definitely one of the great books ever made. The reason why this book is so great because of the themes or elements of this wonderful book. The thing that also made it a great book was that it was very clear and easy to understand.The first theme is Action. What fantasy book is any good without any action. Action is everywhere in this book, such as the battle at Yazuak and the battle under Farthen' Dur. It's very exciting and you can't wait what comes at you next. The second theme is love. Although there isn't that much love, love is created in the heart of Eragon, as he dreams about a beautiful elf and later meets her. He later saves her from a prison that she is trapped in. The third theme is fantasy. This book is a fantasy book because of the magic, the dragons, the unique races. The dwarves of the earth, the elves of the forest, the dragons of the air, the clashing of swords, all of these are great ideas of a fantasy book. I loved these ideas and created many ideas in my head.Now, the favorite part in my book was very hard to choose but I finally chose. It is the Battle Under Farthen' Dur. It was a great battle between the strong Varden and the blood lusting Urgals and Kulls. It had all the juicy action you want and was very exciting. If you imagine it in your mind, you can hear the swords clash, the dragon Saphira roar, and the kulls and urgals grunts. It was truly a great part indeed."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Eragon, by far, was the best action/adventure book that I've read. It was kind of gory and has quite a bit of blood and destruction. Eragon takes place in a kind of midevil time with dragons, potions, witches/wizards, dwarfs, elves, and swords. Alagaesia, the empire in which Eragon and Saphera live, kind of resembles Alaska as far as the placement of mountians and oceans. Alagaesia even has the shape og Alaska. Anyway, Eragon takes a long journey around Alagaesia chasing the Razac(dark creatures that bring death and dispear, they also killed Eragons uncle)with his companion, Brom. Brom was killed by the Razac when he was found. Eragon's new companion was the son of a forsworn rider. The three(don't forget Saphera) Made their way to the varden. The Varden is a very peaceful place in the mountians outside of the empire. It origanlly belonged and was carved by the dwarfs. The finest marble and the largest precious stones that you'll ever 'see'. When they least expect it, the varden is attacked by the kull, very large and strong urgals controlled by the shade. The shade is a evil wizard like guy that Eragon must defeat. The bad thing is, the shade is the most powerful being on the planet and only 2 people in all of the peoples living days have fought aganst a shade and lived. Eragon is facing the bigest life and death situation of his life.... Suddenly, Saphera burst out of the dragon hold and distracted the shade. Eragon gets a good shotat the heart and the shades mind. He makes a stab with his sword, hits the target, and watches the shade vaporize into nowhere. The shade is dead.I reccomend this book for boys mostly because of all of the blood and stuff girls might not like, but haygirls, im not stoppin you from reading it!! Also, if you are like me and only are intrested in action/adventure series books, read on!!!!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Being a sci fi fan and read Lord of the Rings when I was teen, I was amazed that this young author could hold my interest for so long. I'm disappointed that I have to wait until 08/05 to get book 2. Eragon is well written especially when it was written by someone so young. People who critize this book should think first, I would like you to sit down and write out a well rehearsed book with chapters that intrigue and make you read on and on. I couldn't put the book down. Yes there are elfs and dwarves as in Lord of the Rings, but it is a truly different book, and they way he writes about Shapira, does make me wish to read more. I truly truly loved it, and I'm no teenager, being 40'sh myself, who has read thousands of books over the years, I give it 2 thumbs up.

Other people might tell you that this book is nothing more than a hodgepodge of Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, and star wars, which is true. But Eragon is a classic, mixing the world of science-fiction and fantasy. Yes, things are borrowed and repeated (e.g Brom is to Gandalf, as Eragon is to Aragon). Yes, there is more telling than showing in description. However, I was engrossed for weeks on end, my mind consumed with Paolini's fantastic world. This, I believe, would appeal more to pre-teens and younger adolescents than any other age group. Saphira, his dragon, was the most amusing out of all of them. Despite the fact that I truly enjoyed it, I wish Paolini would show his characters carry out his actions, instead of telling them. I think that if you appreciated Lord of the Rings, and you don't mind fragments of it in Eragon, it'll captivate you."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This book was absolutely fabulous...

Fortunately for the book, this does not overly detract form the story. The influences of other authors such as Tolkien, Eddings and a few others make themselves aparent and Paolini does a good job of incorporating the best of all of these authors into his first novel.Writing style aside, I must say that I thoughly enjoyed this first installment. The chases, skirmishes and final battle all had me racing through the pages to find out what would happen. The best praise that I can give this book is that when I finally finished the last word, I was dissapointed that the book had come to an end."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I loved this book! I discovered this book when I was suffering from the pain of finishing the last Harry Potter book and trying to find a replacement for the magical world of Hogwarts. I purchased this book, along with Jonathan Stroud's Bartimeaus Trilogy Book 1(which was also a fun and gripping novel that I reccomend.). This book is a lot of fun. I was instantly sucked into the world that Christopher Paolini has created. The book is a wonderful action/adventure for fans of Harry Potter or The Lord Of The Rings. The characters are all deep, and complex, with there own personalities and reasons to either like or hate them. I loved the relationship between Eragon and his dragon, Saphira. I am excited to see how big Saphira grows and what other adventures the two go through together. Mr.Paolini creates subplots that make you yearn for more and it's a good thing there are 2 more books because I am excited to hear more about the characters. The only downfall to this book is the unfortunate Lord Of The Rings similarity. The book is almost TOO alike in it's characters and locations that at times you find yourself confused about certain events occuring. I had a hard time visualizing Eragon because his name is literally the same as Aragon or The Lord Of The Rings! A lot of creatures in the book are the same also which can get annoying. This book is great though. I highly reccomend it."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This was a great book. It kept a fast pace, which made me want to read it straight through.

Just because it is long and written by a young author should not deceive you. This book is packed with action and excitement. The worst part of the book (if I have to name one) is the prologue. I starts you wondering but it is very confusing and you may not get the point of it unitl much later in the book. Other than that, it a wonderfully written book and I suggest it to people above 10 or just love action and adventure.

To the point, Mr. Paolini has written a masterpiece, with a gripping storyline, endearing characters, and a masterfully created world.

I think the author, whom is now 18 or 19, has started out with a great writing career that is sure to be a great one. I recommend this book to those who enjoy fantasy, adventure, action, and so much more! People are talking about not liking it after JUST three chapters, but you have to read further into it for it to get interesting (though it caught my attention from page one). No book should just dive right into the plot. Over all this book is worth taking the time to read!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"My son read this book and liked it so much he got the book on CD and listened to the whole thing over again. Its a large book and my son is usually intimidated by books that size. Once he got into it, he was sorry when it ended!Even tho the CD audio version is expensive its as wonderful as the book. My son was especially impressed that someone his age wrote it and is eagerly anticipating the second book! I let him write a review of it. This is his review:The best book I read this summer was Eragon by Christopher Paolini. This book of fantasy is an impressive 500 pages however the story is so captivating you can't stop reading.While hunting, Eragon comes across a mysterious blue stone in the woods. He soon realizes that the stone is in fact an egg when it hatches into a small blue dragon. For fear of punishment, Eragon must raise his dragon in secret. Eragon begins to bond with Saphira, but an evil force soon attacks his home and kills his uncle. Seeking revenge, Eragon sets out with his mentor Brom to find the Ra'zac while also trying to keep his dragon hidden from King Galbatorix. Along the way Eragon learns of himself and his place in history.This book is an excellent example of fantasy containing action, adventure, magic, and fighting. The plot moves quickly and keeps the reader interested in the story line. Both the characters and the setting are described in great detail allowing for vivid mental pictures. Eragon's thoughts and feelings are always shared with the reader permitting them to understand more of the character and the problems he faces. As a teenager myself, I was able to connect with this character and understand his struggles as he faces obstacles and must learn how to mature into a brave warrior.I highly recommend this book to any teenage boy who enjoys fantasy. I would give it two thumbs way up for being the best book I ever read."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I read this and I have to say it was by far the BEST BOOK I EVER READ!!!!!!

I had no idea that I was purchasing the best book i had ever read, second only to Lord of the Rings. It is packed with characters that you get to know so well, that you feel like you could recognize them in the grocery store. The plot is simple enough for a reader to understand easily, but so colorful that it feels like its happening to you.It resembles The Lord of the Rings in a few ways. First and formost is the names of some of the charactors, and this angers some people. The thing that they fail to see is that the only the names are similar, but the characters are very vivid and original.(...) I can tell you where he gets his insperatian for landscape in the book. His details of the suroundings in the book are so intricately woven and detailed that I feal like he is describeing my home. This connection puts me so inside the story that it feels like i am part of the book.Eragon is a great start to a trilogy destined to be a classic. Tons of fantasy fans will be lined up at book stores for the second part of the trilogy, and I will be one of them."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I read this book in a day and a halph. It is a very adictive book so I couldn't put it down. The story in this book was magnificent and kept you thirsting for more.

Doesn't that just really make you sick."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I have to admit, the first time I read this book, it annoyed me. In fact, scratch that, it irritated me to the point I had to set it down and watch some mind-numbing TV to calm myself.Why?Because this book, to me, was mostly a hack. I could flip through my favorite (earlier) fantasies, likely known to Paolini himself, and point out a phrase that was exactly the same in the two.Certainly, the story itself is a bit different. But the fact is I found myself wondering why the book got so much attention when it wasn't particularly original in itself. The characters featured are familiar to most of us (dragons, elves, dwarves, etc.) But that wasn't what bothered me; the thing that bothered me was that the characters were so similar to those in other books. The Riders were like to the Aes Sedai (from Jordan's Wheel of Time Series), as the Shades were like...well, the Shades, also from Jordan. In fact, most of the things I read in 'Eragon' were remarkable in their similarity to Jordan. Poor farm boy, near the mountains, living outside of town, with no mother?The second time I read 'Eragon', I put all prejudices aside and just enjoyed the thing for what it was: a work meant solely for entertainment. There aren't any underlying meanings or anything inparticular to \\"read into\\" in the story. That said, it IS a very engrossing book, one that will keep you hooked for the few hours it takes to read it.But as for buying, I'd just check 'Eragon' out at the library. It's fun, but it's no Tolkien."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Point-blank. Eragon is... a sign that Chris Paolini's gonna get better. I found out about Eragon while surfing the net researching for homework. I clicked on the link and found the little interview Chris did with Good Morning America or whatever morning show. Seeing that interview, I got excited and decided to see for myself what Eragon was really worth. Before I start to comment on the writing, he did a good job with the map. I really like that huge...blank space where the desert should be. ^_^ But honestly, the map as a whole was very well-done. Myself, I really don't have the patience to draw a map and incorporate that with the book I'm writing. Eh, whatever. The depiction of Saphira on the cover's...kind of scary. She kind of has that \\"I know something you don't know\\" air...but hey, Chris didn't draw it.Now for the BOOK! YEEE! I don't see why people need to be so hard on him. He's new to the professional writing gig! now watch me contradict myself for telling people not to be too hard on him. I'm not really a fantasy reader, so I'm not totally familiar with the things Chris picked up his material from, except for the Lord of the Rings (duh). But I have to say, a lot of the stuff seemed to be taken straight from that epic. I think the whole Eragon/Aragorn thing is a coincidence. But Dragon, switch D with E, pretty clever...not really.I also felt that it was a tad predictable and cliche; the deaths were predictable, acts of chivalry: predictable, psycho twins wanting to take advantage of people's powers: coincidentally Matrixy, but quite...dumb. That guy's gonna die. HEY LOOK! He's dead! Eragon's gonna pass out again, and again, and again...and he does: again, and again, and again. Something tells me that Chris uses the whole K.O. sitch when he's run out of ideas for the chapter. I can't blame him. If I couldn't think of what should happen nezt, I'd probably knock out the main character...or maybe they'd just eat stuff.Okay, defense mode again. Everyone's ranting about how the elves are so tall and fair and perfect. Well...other than being little shoemakers, Santa's servants, or wrinkly slaves dressed in pillowcases, you can't really go to far with elves. (...)Writing style: well enough to keep me going, not wanting to stop reading even after Eragon's passed out for the fourth time. However, in some cases less is more; hence the adjectives. Some seem out of place: like a very basic sentence with some very flowery adjective popping up out of nowhere. Like that.Overall, good book. Well worth reading. I'd say that Chris Paolini has great potential, and that his books will grow as he does, which will make the sequels much better.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Raised as a humble farmer, Eragon discovers a strange jewel--which turns out to be a dragon egg. Dragon riders once protected the land and ensured justice, but now, except for the evil King, the dragon riders are destroyed. The King's spies learn of the dragon's birth and destroy Eragon's uncle in an effort to find him and the dragon. If they can turn Eragon to the dark side, the King will be unstoppable. Fortunately, Eragon escapes and, with the help of an old bard, Eragon learns magic, swordfighting, and dragon tactics. Still, the King's power is too strong to confront alone.After a narrow escape, Eragon finds a beautiful elf-woman held captive by the King's shade. Together with a stranger who saves him, Eragon, the dragon, and the unconscious elf make their way to a rebel fortress deep in the dwarvish mountains. Yet the King has created evil alliances and his Urgal (Orc) subjects invade the Dwarf kingdom where all of Eragon's magic and power avail him little against the powerful shade.In the movie business, high-concept projects are frequently described as a combination of two well-known films. Eragon is definitely Starwars meets the Lord of the Rings. Set in a Middle-Earth world of elves, dwarves, orcs, and dragons, we have the familiar adventures of Luke Skywalker--the loss of his uncle, his aging warrior-bard teacher, the somewhat disreputable buddy, and the beautiful princess. Pretty good stuff.I'm torn in this review. On the one hand, it's an incredible feat for a fifteen-year-old author like Christopher Paolini to complete an entire novel, let alone an epic five-hundred pager. For the most part, Paolini's writing is competent, only occasionally drawing the reader out of the story. And the story is an exciting adventure as Eragon is thrown from adventure to adventure. On the other hand, Eragon doesn't really grow as a character. Sure he learns magic and swordfighting, but he's still the same whiny kid at the end of the story that he was at the beginning.Paolini is an author to watch. He's got talent and a fine sense of story. With a bit more experience in the world and some serious effort on character development, he may become a major author. ERAGON only hints at this promise, but it's a pleasant hint."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I bought this book after reading some wonderful, and poor reviews about this book, and I have to say that after reading this wonderful book that I agree with the wonderful reviews.

I will not go into every detail of the book as it so long, but to me if your looking for a slow magical read that involves elves, trollls dwarfs and other magical creatures give this book a try. I am anxiously awaiting for The Eldest, second in this 3 book series. To the people who critisized it because of McCaffrey's Dragon Series, this book is different a kind of Dragon Riders, they are in magical world, not a distant planet in Space.

It gave entertainment without adding all the extra unneeded scenes. I definitely see the traces of Tolkien and Brooks (what fantasy writer does not look up to such?). I think it is a book you either like or dislike. Hardcore fantasy readers might deem it too simplistic or too amateur (the boy was 15 remember...) while others may feel it a refreshing retreat from the complexity of Tolkien. Those who find Tolkien and Brooks and the like to be too complex, but long for fantasy might find Eragon a nice beginner into the realm of elves and kings. Perhaps later they too will delve into our world of Swords and Rings. For a boy of 15, when he wrote this, I am highly impressed. Would any of us have been able to put out such work at such an early age... think about that the next time you pick up a book from a young author."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I recieved this book for my birthday from my parents. They know I am a fan of science fiction and fantasy, liked dragons. They heard about this from some TV talk show where they had the kid on. I call him a kid even though he's not that much younger than me. The one good thing I have to say about the author is that he can write a semi-suspenceful story so that you want to find out what happens (even though you can mostly guess as to what will happen, its so cliche).Now for everything bad. By the time I reached page 60 I knew I was in for trouble. Everything about the Dragon Riders is identical or nearly identical to the Dragonriders of Pern series by McCaffrey, from the dragon choosing its rider to the telpathic communication.As I read on it got worse, the adventure starts when Eragon home is destroyed the single most cliche way to start an adventure. I was rolling in the floor laughing when Eragon first used magic, as it is identical to the way 99% of spells from RPGs are cast.I won't pick on the author for having elves and dwarves, many fantasy stories do that are quite good in my oppinion. I will pick on him though for having the elves get to the main land the same way Tolkien does, by boat from far away lands.I will say though it is a decent read if only to laugh at the obvious short cummings of the author's immagination. Like some places called Isenstar. Hmm lets see where he got this.. Isenguard (problably not spelled right) and Evenstar (also probably not spelled right) put them together and we have just ripped a \\"new\\" name from Tolkien's names. I can come up with better names than that from online name generators.You want a GOOD fantasy story then read, Dragonriders of Pern, Tolkien, Drizzt series, and Harry Potter. Or play Lunar the Silver Star Story, any of the Grandias, or Skies of Arcadia.If you want to laugh at a cliche, copied, written with no imagination what-so-ever fantasy adventure story.

It attracts attention and makes people curious, but it hardly improves the quality of the book. Eragon is a mixture of choppy sentences and run-ons. A load of horrible dialogue and characters. Eragon himself may just be the worst character in the entire book with the possible exception of Angela. He, as many have said, is always knocked out in battles, wounded, falls asleep or some other rubbish ending. but he always manages to get out alright, by luck, chance, or help. Does he ever do anything on his own? No! Even though he stabs and kills the Shade in the end, not without the help of his loyal pathetic dragon and the sorry cliche character Arya (who could just as well be any elf in LOTRs, proud, noble, perfect, goody goody, ect) He is saved by Murtagh, by Brom countless times, by Saphira endlessly, by Anglena, everyone saves Eragon. He's a dumb ass, a pathetic charater. Did Paolini ever just use the word \\"said.\\" Maybe once or twice. I heard all kinds of substitiutes: snapped, commented, remarked, stated, everything else. Oh and hear this, the worst of them all &lt;&lt;\\"I'm sorry,\\" apologized Brom.>> Well you said I am sorry! What else could you be doing except apologizing!?

It was a diverting way to travel, but as a mother I kept being annoyed at how whiny and helpless the boy was. For someone taking on the world in a quest, he seems awfully lucky with regard to having people feed him, do the dishes and laundry. It got to be a reoccuring joke as the next Personal Servant appeared as soon as the last one shuffled off-stage.I also deeply disliked the scene where he bundled up a backpack of choice cuts of meat to take home. Before a hard frost. In a world without refrigeration. There was also a mention of the three healthy men with a freehold being \\"too poor\\" to buy a piglet to raise... but they have money for candy on market day. Uh, sure. His utter lack of awareness of how farmsteads work or how you store and prepare food just bugged me. It was just one of many ways you could tell this was written by a teen-ager.Others have written about how derivative it is, but my own pet peeve is the Disney convention of killing off all the mothers. Seriously, women are NOT that threatening. Nor that helpless: nearly every woman portrayed (with three exceptions) was a helpless decorative object who couldn't fight their own battles. Uh, sure.

I don't reallymind that too much so long as it's well written.Let's face it, in the genre of fantasy...whether it behigh fantasy or epic fantasy, most ideas are simply rehashedideas rewritten in a new light.BUT, I am writing while i'm only halfway through reading it.I am having an extremely difficult time trying to finish it.I find the writing to be extremely distracting as i run throughit. Every couple pages, I end up stopping and thinking,\\"What the heck is this crud???\\" (quote edited)The writing is immature and the character development and someof the dialogue is simply absurd.The biggest problem i have with the book is the plot.There are so many holes in it, the feasibility of theplot/history is just too improbable. Paolini tries toexplain why things occurred as they did in his novel's historyusing dialogue but those explanations just aren'tremotely plausible.As someone else mentioned, this should never have been published.It was probably published because of the novelty of havingsuch a work by a 15 yr old. I'm not trying to take anythingalway from the author but since i started reading Eragon,I couldn't help but think that this is a childrens book fitonly for children.

This book lacks everything that is vital to a good fantasy novel: Original plot line, strong characterization, gender balanced cast, and decent dialogue.Paolini uses far too many adverbs, as do many other amateur writers, and he cannot write a good action scene to save his life. The characters were very weak with minimal personality, and none of them were memorable.Also, most of the plot and setting of this book was stolen from a) Tolkien, b) Ursula K. Leguin, or c) Anne McCaffrey. Many of the names of places or people were far to easy to trace back to their sources. Am I the only person who thinks that 'Eragon' sounds suspiciously like Tolkien's character 'Aragorn'? And once that link is established, it's not difficult to see that 'Arya' is an adaptation of 'Arwen'.But what really enraged me about this book was the blatant lack of female characters. In a five hundred page book, only three non-male characters have more than two lines each, and one of them is the dragon. The other two are Arya the elf and Angela the witch. There is nothing wrong with Angela, but Arya is another matter entirely. If she is such a powerful mage and skilled swordswoman, why did she need to be rescued by a fifteen year old by with an enlarged ego? A villan who defeated Arya in about two seconds was later killed by Eragon. I think this is disgusting (...). Maybe I'm just biased because I'm female, but personally, I hate books where the male characters are the best at everything.In conclusion, don't read this book.

He took so much from it, I mean, think about it. Eragon, Aragorn. Tall, strong, dark eyebrowed, bow and arrow-clad, horse-riding male elves, and the same but beautiful, dark haired female elves. He based a language on Old Norse, as did Tolkien. The whole Lord of the Rings essence is in the book, but it's lacking his incredible originality. It is really well written, though, given that he was only 15, but still, I can't figure out how it got through the editor (if he had one). But still, it WAS a good book. I'm still more apt to criticizism though, and I'm haveing a bit of a hard time finding good things to say about the book, but I think that it's worth reading, just don't expect any great work of art."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"The Inheritance Trilogy was started when Christopher Paolini was 15, and finished when he was 19. He is now 22 and I doubt he has had the chance to develop as a writer Those of those who champion this series are either completely stunned that a teenager could actually manage to put ink on paper, or just plain haven't read the literary masterpieces that he blatantly plagarized.The Inheritance Trilogy is the the self insertion of Paolini himself in a magical Tolkien-esque pseudo-land surrounded by a cast of horribly unlikeable cliche's. It seems that each new book brings Paolini...I mean Eragon a host of new powers, including immortality! The author passes immortality out to characters like candy at a Independence Day Parade, and the characters treat it with the same nonchalant bland stare that they treat every other \\"event\\" in the series's insanely dry plot line.If you're a parent considering purchasing the series for your young writer, do so only as a manual for what to NOT do in their writing. I mean this literally, this is the typical writing quality of any young teen fantasy writer. Any distinguished writer must go through years of refinement, rejection, and soul searching. Paolini had these experiences robbed of him. His publisher parents' connections created this career, not a developed writing style. Moms and Dads, your child can write this well if not better, I can almost promise you; possibly without even blatantly robbing nearly word for word from much better series written by writers who have had a chance to develop. Do your child a favor and buy Tolkien, Rowling, Goodkind, or CS Lewis. Don't lower their standards, The Inheritance Trilogy could quite possibly stunt their growth as writers, I kid you not.Fans of this series can grow near rabid as they claim that everything in the fantasy genre has been \\"taken\\" and that drawing things from those greater series is inevitable. However I find this far from true, if there is always something to imagine, that is the magic of that uniquely human ability. Those greater series drew their influence from ancient mythology, legend, and stories and created wholly unique ideas to weave their literary tapestries. Paolini in his immaturity has taken from these books and comes dangerously close to plagarism in several instances, most likely tweaked by the insistence of his publishers. This and his own self insertion of Eragon as his insanely perfect immortal alter ego is typical of undeveloped fantasy writing, any teen can and do create it every day with online fanfictions.I leave you with a quote from Paolini himself. When called upon to write a review for J.K. Rowling's (a truly developed writer with more than her fair share of failures) successful \\"Harry Potter and the Half-blood Prince\\" this is what he had to say:\\"One of the greatest pleasures of reading this series is seeing J.K.Rowling develop as a writer, and she certainly spreads her wings here\\".Arrogant no? Please don't let your child end up like this.(FOR ALL CHRISTMAS SHOPPING PARENTS!)For those who I was unable to save from the fate of buying Eragon, I must stop you from repeating this terrible mistake. Buy your child a classic, buy them mythologies and legends, buy them books on writing techniques, but for Tolkien's sake, don't buy them the Inheritance Trilogy."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"*** Caution - Spoilers! ***My gosh. I'll bet my whole head of hair that Star Wars is one of Paolini's favorite movies.As I read Eragon (and Eldest, for that matter), it was just mind-blowing HOW MUCH his story parallels Star Wars. I suppose George Lucas never read this book, otherwise he'd be fuming.It astounded me how close the storylines were:Eragon/Luke living with his Uncle Garrow/Owen in the far reaches of Alagaesia/the Empire, and he never knew his parents. Check.Eragon/Luke finds something unusual, then the evil King Galbatorix/Darth Vader uses the Ra'zac/Stormtroopers to burn down his farm, killing Uncle Garrow/Owen. Check.Eragon/Luke takes off with the mysterious old guy from town, Brom/Obi-Wan Kenobi. Brom/Obi-Wan teaches Eragon/Luke about dragons & magic/the Force. Eragon/Luke discovers Brom/Obi-Wan was a dragon-rider/Jedi. Check.Brom/Obi-Wan dies while fighting the forces of evil, so Eragon/Luke must finish his training with Oromis/Yoda in a distant land. Check....and it just goes ON and ON and ON and ON like this, all through Eldest as well. Since I had seen Star Wars before, this book got a bit predictable. It's almost the exact same story, but a different setting - fantasy instead of sci-fi.Sigh. All in all, it's pretty well-written, for a 17 year-old, at least. I guess it was also entertaining, if even to just sit and point out the parts of his story that he got from other books.Should I call George Lucas?"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I just returned from a summer working as a camp counselor, and I'd heard great things from my campers about Eragon so I decided to give it a shot. Fantasy is one of my favorite genres (lots of McCaffrey and Tolkein) so I had high hopes despite the fact that I had actually not purchased the book earlier because the jacket design looked rather childish. I had no idea until halfway through the book that Christopher Paolini started writing Eragon at 15. I discovered this, however, because I had gotten frustrated with the writing and needed to take a break, so I read the author bio in the back.He was 15 and boy does it show. If I had to describe the book in three words they would be repetitive, derivative, and undeveloped.Repetitive- How many times can this flipping kid Eragon fight someone, pass out, and wake up safe and sound in a warm bed soon after? It happened so many times in the book I literally threw it on the floor in disgust at one point. It was like playing an RPG!Derivative- I know Paolini probably couldn't help himself and didn't know he was doing it but he has blatantly copied storylines and lore from some of the best authors in the business. Though having grown up with McCaffrey and Tolkein it can be hard to imagine the realm of fantsy in any terms other than their own. The relationship of men and dragons is straight McCaffrey, I am absolutely certain that the third book will contain a \\"Luke, I am your father\\" moment with Eragon and Galbatorix, and the Kull are so derivative of Tolkein's Uruk-hai I have actually called them that while discussing the book with my father.Underdeveloped- Good lord. The writing. The characters are so undeveloped, and until about halfway through the book (when I suspect his mother began helping him) Paolini showed absolutely no inclination to include scene-setting details or incidents that don't advance the plot but do flesh out the story. He just goes from fight to fight to fight, with nobody having truly compelling reasons for anything they do. What is worse is that he is not very good at describing the fights themselves, so they all run together. His foreshadowing is glaringly obvious (I use Brom's true occupation and the uses of the really big slide to illustrate this). He fails to evoke empathy for his characters, and he even wrote in a mommy and daddy to usher Eragon through the story (Saphira and Brom). The first half of the story, before the dramatic shift in writing style (but unfortunately not plot development) reads like a story my brother wrote about a spy when he was in 7th grade.Incidentally, given the colors of the gemstones he named in his description of Tronjheim, the city-mountain sounds exceptionally ugly.He also failed to create a nuanced, compelling kingdom or distinct races. All the names across every race sound similar, different races' languages all sound the same...the only difference is their physical descriptions.All this being said, I do not think he is a bad writer. I think he is merely inexperienced. It is obvious from his writing that Paolini did not spend much time out of his bedroom as a child, so he has very little by way of experience to bring to his novel. His characters are so pitifully developed because he really only has the emotions and responses he has observed in himself and his parents to draw from. I think with a little time and a lot more real-world experience he could be an excellent fantasy writer.I wouldn't recommend this book to a discerning fantasy reader, it is my Dad's opinion that at the ripe old age of 20 I could write something better, but for a younger boy it would be just the thing."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"As a teenaged writer myself, I picked up Eragon after reading on the inside flap that the author started writing it at 15. However, I was severely disappointed when I started reading the book. Sure, the cover's attractive, and sure, the author was a teenager when he wrote it -- the book seems to have become a bestseller on those two factors alone, because it definitely wasn't literary merit that's caused it to sell so well.I anticipated Murtagh's little secret from the moment he was introduced, I found the main character to be bland and boring, and the story was hackneyed and ripped from other writers. I recommend fantasy fans read works by far more talented authors such as Holly Lisle, JK Rowling, and Eoin Colfer."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Honestly, I cannot imagine a worse fantasy novel. Not only is the storyline found in its entirety in multiple other books, much of the descriptive language is also lifted from the works of others. I actually noted several segments in which I recognised phrases from other, well-known books that I had read.Speaking of descriptive language: Please stop before my head explodes!! This story possibly merits 150 pages, and yet here it is told in 544. By assuming that his audience has no imagination, the author annoys and alienates. I find it highly pathetic that reviewers are fawning over Mr. Paolini and his work as if it's something special, or even worth reading. I strongly believe in the potential of young people to achieve, and yet this author's poor style and quick fame, far from advancing generational equality, has underscored more worthy attempts of others. I have hopes that Mr. Paolini's creativity and ability will grow, and that his future books will be more original and improved stylistically; however, his first attempt is a waste of a reader's time. A word to potential purchasers of this book: Don't."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Well, its not exactly new. The elements in the book has been used by many other author as well. Forest dwelling Elves, Tunnel dweller Dwarf, Human (hey, thats us), dragon, Urgal (or orcs in LOTR, Gnome in Terry Brook, orcs in Forgoten Realm and many other) and etc etc. Theres the magic sword, magic word, magical creature, magical being and etc. Old stuff I guess. But then again, even Elves and Dwarf came from some western folklore so they are not completely original from certain author are they? And yes, Eragon does wield a magical sword, but so does Drizzt Do'urden, Arilyn Moonblade. Sword of Shanara and Sword of Leah are both magical as well. The only difference is that Eragon's sword happens to be...a bloodthirsty sword, unlike certain noble sword that can only be wield by certain king (cough*Anduril*cough).So...yes, the story element in Eragon is not completely new. I mean if you ever read Sword of Shanara (Terry Brook's first book), the plot really resemble Lord of the Ring. But nobody complain about that now do they? I mean, come on, what fantasy story is \\"brand new\\" except when they are talking about space ship and alien invasion.The story of Eragon is easy to follow. Granted, the plot is somewhat old-fashioned, but its told in a new way. The story starts with how the egg came to be in Eragon's possesion. Eragon, unlike other fantasy characters, is a mere farmboy of no noble standing. He just happen to find the egg (of the dragon) when he is hunting. The egg hatches and a bond is formed between them. Then come the servants of the Empire who hunt the egg and kill Eragon's uncle. Eragon then pursued them for revenge with the help of his dragon and the enigmatic Brom the story teller. During the travel we are introduced to the lore of the dragon, the situation of Alagaesia, magic and more characters. In the travel, Eragon's power grows with the help of Brom. And eventually, he is plunged into the Alagaesia's world of politic which might be more dangerous than a hundred of Kull. And the story goes on.In conclusion, the elements of the story has been used by many other author. But the story itself is oldt in a new way which make it original, well, somewhat. Hopefully the second book will be better than the first one. And hopefully Paolini will be able to create his own world without too much influence from other author."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"When Eragon, by Christopher Paolini, first came out, I refused to buy it. It was a story about a boy learning to ride dragons - a long lost art - which seemed to be cut-and-paste Dragonriders of Pern. It came out right when Lord of the Rings was turning into movies. The name of the lead character - Eragon - seemed to me a direct rip-off of Aragorn's name. Eragon was written by a teenager whose parents both worked in the publishing industry. It seemed clearly a case of publishing parents who had reworked their teenage boy's fan fiction words in order to make money for themselves.Eventually when teenaged friends of mine began talking about it, I felt I should read it to at least participate in their conversations. After all, I adored Lord of the Rings, Dragonriders of Pern, Dune, etc. growing up. Surely I would find similar themes in this work that I could enjoy, even if the writing style was a bit unkempt.I read the book through in two days. It was, as I had figured, rough in style. Despite his many kudos to his publishing team for helping him craft the beginning, the ending, the middle, the dialogue and the grammar, there were numerous problems in there that acted as roadblocks. Still, that was not the real issue. The real issue was that in pretty much every chapter I felt as if I'd read the story before.A boy living with his not-parents. The boy happens to be away, returning to find the smoking home? Star Wars, check. The long-lost dragon egg that happens to open up to him? Pern, check. Just about every scene involving orcs, elves, dwarves and wraiths? Lord of the Rings, check. Desert scenes and \\"Bid'daum\\" (c'mon, Maud Dib backwards???) check. Epic battles and Hrothgar from Beowulf. The \\"true name\\" concern from Earthsea.Just about every name used seemed to call up other books. Isenstar? Vanilor? Mithrim? Also, you get a token female near the end - and a token black person - but other than that the book is all about white guys. I realize you can have that complaint about JRR Tolkien who was born in 1892, and I do very much have that complaint. But it's an issue that should NOT be appearing in a book written in 2003.Finally, many of the plot situations simply make no sense at all. He is learning to read in ONE WEEK? Looking at the map, distances that are covered are randomly long or short in time. Characters do things which make no sense at all but fit into the required plot line. You hear what they are planning to do in a given situation and think to yourself, \\"What in the world are they doing??\\" There were many times I could pretty much recite the dialogue along with them because it was so clearly lifted from book X or Y.I am very much a person who likes fan fiction. I have read a lot of it! It is great for teens to have that creative outlet, to begin building up their skills. It is just like having a crush on a movie star before graduating to a real boyfriend or girlfriend. But nobody would call a crush a \\"real relationship\\". I would never dream of publishing fan fiction as an \\"original story\\". It really seems to me like Christopher's parents - being book publishers - took advantage of him and put his book out there without the thorough editing it needed in order to make money off of him. What if, instead, they had spent a few more years actually homeschooling him and teaching him how to write more independently, and let him make his OWN novel? Think of what he might have achieved! Instead, we are left with these obviously fan-fiction, derivative works, and the controversy that has ensued.This really does GREAT harm to the many high quality teen authors who DO exist out there. Now they will be judged with the Christopher Paolini stigma, as in \\"well, only plagiarists exist in the teen writing world.\\" Kaavya Viswanathan caused equal harm when her novel, written when she was 19, was found to be full of duplicated material. We then forget about REAL teen writers who created inspirational, unique works such as Mary Shelley and Frankenstein (age 19) and S.E. Hinton and The Outsiders (age 16). Even one of my favorite novels of all time - Pride & Prejudice - was begun when Jane Austen was 14. Please, let's not let Eragon spread the assumption that all teen writers can do is regurgitate the things they've read.For people who say \\"I enjoyed the story\\" - I really encourage you to read the original stories by JRR Tolkien, Anne McCaffrey, Ursula K. Le Guin, etc. Those stories are also great for teenagers and are much more eloquent and rich in meaning. To have teens reading this instead is like reading \\"novel lite\\". Why listen to a tinny AM version of a song when you have access to the full, rich high quality MP3 of it?Finally, the copy I picked up is the paperback with the movie cover. It has movie photos WITHIN the book - meaning even though I deliberately tried not to look at them, the \\"final scenes\\" images were right next to page 373 when I tried to keep reading. Talk about WRONG! What's next, a cover blurb that reveals the ending twist?Very disappointing."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I hated this book. People seem to give Paolini credit because he was a kid when he wrote it. But, he goes up and actually COMPARES his book to the greatness of other fantasy books like Beowulf and LOTR. If he wants to compare his book to books written by competent authors, his readers should grade Eragon with the same strictness. If Tolkien had written this, what would the reviews be? Much lower.

I read the Lord of the Rings books for the first time when I was about 16. I can't remember having enjoyed the experience of entering a fantasy world this much since my first Tolkien experience. Indeed, in some ways, this was better: Tolkien can get tedious after a few thousand pages; this does not. I am somewhat surprised by the review that gets upset about the various archetypal aspects of the plot, with the general comment: \\"It's been done before, better.\\" Balderdash. Such a comment is like saying that to Tolkien because of Gilgamesh, King Arthur, Moses and endless other wonderful stories. This book is a good read. Period. The only distraction for me was, knowing the age of the author when he began the book, it was occasionally startling when he had insights, vocabulary -- thoughts -- that seemed a lot from someone so young. What is particularly fun, and perhaps the advantage he had from his age, is the author's playful way of dealing with the hero, age 15-16: The banter between his dragon and him highlights the kind of mistakes and mindset we all have at that age, that wonderful combination of immaturity and growth. For what it's worth, I'd much rather enjoy a well-spun yarn, with strong characters and fine descriptive prose than a piece written perfectly to an editorialist's vision of when to say \\"..., he asked.\\" One final note: I \\"read\\" this by listening to a download from Audiobooks, which is quite good."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"maybe the reason this book is doing well is becuz its timeless. the quest is timeless. love is timeless. magic is timeless. and i say its a good thing when someone writes something about those things. why not read it? if you like it i think u'll agree with me. take yr time on timeless books, its better than sittin around in a bad movie."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Seeing as there are currently over 1200 reviews written on this book alone, I don't know that mine will get much attention. Still, after reading a few, I felt I could conceivably add my own opinion to the mix. No, Eragon is not the most original fantasy novel ever written. Ever since Tolkien's LOTR was published, fantasy novels have often been derivative of that storyline: elves, dwarves, quests, swords, magic, etc. One review mentioned the fact that Eragon is one letter down from Dragon as a problem with the story. Of all the possible nit-picks, I found this one laughable. Regardless of his age, which seems to be a big issue, I found this to be as good as many fantasy novels I've read by older, supposedly better writers. I fully admit that I am a scifi/fantasy nut. I will enjoy almost anything that is some kind of escapist novel. So, in the end, I would recommend this Eragon, not as an amazing in-depth examination of the soul or a tremendously original new fascinatingly one-of-a-kind plot that no one has ever done before. I think there are few fantasy novels that have been published which meet the criteria that Eragon has apparently been found lacking. It is an enjoyable story. Nothing more, nothing less.

I can assure you that Star Wars wasnt the first time someone considered this as a backround for a main character of a book. Yes, Eragon does change his life rather quickly and becomes skilled in certain things very quickly, do you expect him to wright the whole book about him being trained? Theres another thing, Eragon reviews say he learns to quickly, yet in Eldest reviews, he learns to slowly. Suprise suprise.Dont look at every book as something to be judged and placed into a catagory of how well its written. Cast aside the critic personality and look at the book through a larger picture. I would like to see you critics wright something better than this. Strange, you put other work down yet couldnt do it yourself if you tried. Give the man the respect he needs. May not be the best but definatly one of my favorites. I in fact enjoy reading these books more the the Harry Potter series. Try giving respect to a book and dont look at past books, sit back and enjoy it. Just because you didnt wright a book and get famous at a young age doesnt mean someone else cant. Its a great accomplishment and a rather exciting read. Give it a peek, if you enjoy bringing books that arent classics down .. you wont enjoy this book. Yet if you enjoy reading a book that may not be origanal but is a fresh new storie and will keep you reading through the night, give it a try. Even you critics cannot say this book was boring, its not a copie, but a .... remix. A more exciting remix.Great book, trust me. Dont be a critic, be a simple person that enjoys reading a good book. This small paraghraph may not have made your blood pump up with excitement to read it, so now I would like to say its MORE than a good book. Dont even say the characters dont have peronality, I found it simple to fit them in the right place. So I repeat, GIVE IT A TRY."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This is a story about a mediocre farm boy who discovers a strange stone in the feared mountain range \\"the Spine\\".

Eragon has a good blend of action, comedy and political intrigue. Christopher Paolini does a good job of developing the characters to the point that they become 3 dimensional and real. I am looking forward to the third installment and future work by this author."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This novel was entertaining from the first page to the last. I felt a little put off by some of the comments from other reviewers, namely saying there were too many characters, but I didn't find that to be true at all.The characterization in this story was excellent. It took me a bit to get used to the idea of a dragon communicating so well, but the author pulled it off well. It was great to read a dragon story where the dragons are not horrible fire breathing creatures, set out only to destroy human kind.I'm so impressed with the writing ability of so young an author. Good job!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Ignore the five stars I accidentally gave, above. I'm rating this book vaguely better than a three-plus. Regardless of how you rate it, you've got a good, basic epic fantasy--not very original, but pretty adept at handling the politics. You've got a typical youth bound for glory who has no clue of it, but this is handled well because he doesn't know for sure who he should aid. A dual-kingship between the Varden and the dwarves complicates matters, by employing unwritten rules in how to fulfill these loyalties. Weird, but Paolini handles it with wisdom. There's King Galbatorix who runs his own show off stage, whom you'll probably sneer at for a while. The lack of originality will be obvious in various ideas and tropes that have been used before in stories. But the prose is lucid, and clear as spring water. The development is brisk, unlike many of today's epics, but I felt as if the resolution of problems as big as these was too easy, sometimes. The basic setup and a little you'll find inside: An elfin princess is surrounded by evil orcen-ogrish creatures. She teleports the precious egg she is carrying out of harm's way, but is captured. The boy Eragon finds the egg, and takes it. It hatches into a dragon, and Eragon becomes its rider. A storyteller helps Eragon realize who he is, his destiny, and thirst for vengeance, when evil forces destroy his home and kill his guardian(uncle?). Eragon and the storyteller set forth to mete justice. Their plan for this involves tracking the sales of a mysterious oil through the records at shipping ports (pretty cool.) Lots of fights, captures, escapes and encounters with witches, mind wizards, werecats, and other quaint characters pass through this tale, some to help him, some to stymie his efforts. It's a good way to pass time."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I thought this book was pretty good. It was a very enjoyable read, though perhaps not the most well written book. I read these books because my friends had all really loved them, but I though it would be awful, however, it really wasn't. There are parts that are a little predictable and boring, but overall it was good. I would recommend reading these books if you enjoy fantasy because I think you could really like them."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"What you almost always hear first about this book is \\"wow, it was written by a 17-yr-old\\". And the author is fully deserving of the respect and admiration he gets--it is indeed an impressive book for a 17-year-old to have written. What he probably should not have gotten was a publishing contract, since while it is impressive for a 17-yr-old, it is less than impressive for a published work of fiction.If an adult had written and published this, I would have been disgusted (as I was with the Sword of Shannara) with the clear calculation that had gone into the work: \\"ok, I'll take a lot of Tolkien, a lot of McCaffery, a good amount of Leguin, some Dragonlance, some Star Wars, etc. It will be a can't miss book.\\" Since it's the product not of an adult but of a teenager, it comes across much more positively--as a work of fiction by someone who has read lots and absorbed lots of fantasy and simply didn't have the experience (or the good editor) to take out all of his favorite parts of other works. How can I dislike or be too critical of someone who so obviously loved some of my own favorite authors, loved them so much that they simply took over his book through I'm guessing no fault of his own.And that in a nutshell is the problem with Eragon. The story is cliched, formulaic and barely passable as are the characters and the language is simply what you would expect from a somewhat precocious teen fan of adult fantasy. If you have any experience in the field of fantasy at all, reading Eragon will feel like a visit to Las Vegas (though not so tacky)--sure you can see New York and Paris and Italy, but they are mere shadows of the real thing. So McCaffery's telepathic link between dragon and rider is here, but not the powerful emotionality of her (especially earlier) works. LeGuin's idea of one true name and one true language forming the backbone of magic is here, but not her masterful sense of order and balance and restraint, not to mention the sparse beauty of her language. And of course, the graceful, bow-carrying elves, the gruff and secretive mentor with magical powers, the withdrawn dwarves, etc. all show up in their correct place and time. As a high school English teacher, the story and characters are exactly what I would expect to see if I picked up one of my fantasy fan's personal notebooks off of their desks and began reading. Even the people and place names are far too imitative (as opposed to inspired by). To be perfectly honest, it was so much like my students' writings I had to struggle to continue past the first ten pages.Does that mean nobody could enjoy this book? A quick look at the reviews clearly shows that many have (most of them young I'm sure). If you have read Tolkien, McCaffery, LeGuin, Jordan, Lewis, Pullman, Donaldson, etc., then I'd strongly suggest skipping Eragon. You'll not only be heavily disappointed by the weaknesses in plot, character development, and language, but you'll probably be annoyed at how often your favorite authors appear in borrowed and poorer clothing. If you have little experience in fantasy and so won't be bothered by the obviously derivative nature of this book, you'll probably enjoy it but there are far better works to begin a lifetime of fantasy reading with and even if you start with Eragon, I hope you quickly move onto them, beginning with the above list and adding for younger readers people like Lloyd Alexander, E. Nesbit, Robin McKinley, and many, many others. I'd like to see what this young author comes up with in another five-ten years, but for now he's still retelling the stories he liked himself, rather than writing down his own."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"To start off, I must say that for his age, Christopher Paolini obviously has an innate talent for writing. I've always been a fantasy fan and enjoyed his book, \\"Eragon\\". But the thing that kept me from fully enjoying this novel is that I have found numerous words in Eragon, that have been taken from J.R.R. Tolkein's Lord of the Rings series, often having one or two letters changed. The words I've found in Eragon are in capitals and the comparison words I've found in Lord of the Rings are on the right.IMILADRIS>ImladrisVANILOR>ValinorARDWEN>ArwenCERANTHOR>CaranthirBIERLAND>BeleriandISENSTAR>IsengaurdMELIAN>MelianMITHRIM>MithrimISIDAR>IsildurTURIN>Turin (note: the \\"u,\\" in the right \\"Turin,\\" has an accent)ERAGON>ARAGORN (comparison in pronunciation)Thank you"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"That was the first thought that popped into my head after reading this monstrosity. I really have only myself to blame. I had read so many reviews saying how boring, derivative, and pointless this book was, that I thought I would read this book out of a morbid curiosity. Even reading a casual summary of the plot will reveal that it is a complete rip off of Star Wars. Brom is Obi Wan Kenobi, Eragon is Luke Skywalker, his dragon is R2D2, and Arya is Princess Leia. What was not ripped off of Star Wars was ripped off from the Lord of the Rings, Dragon Riders of Pern, and/or A Wizard of Earthsea. The only reason so many people love this book is for the same reason that people love McDonalds hamburgers: neither group has tasted the real thing. Those looking for GOOD young adult fantasy books should read The Farsala Trilogy, and/or Goblin Wood, both by Hilari Bell, or the Bartamaeus Trilogy, by Jonathan Stroud. Those who want to read a good heroic story should read Redwall books, by Brian Jacques. The plot itself was boring, and devoted half its length to travel and exposition. For those who say it's good for a fifteen year old, guesss what? Paolini was nineteen when he finished writing it, and is now twenty-two. Many otherr young autors start writing at 15 or younger. The only reason this book got published was because his parents owned their own publishing company, and Paolini, who had graduated from school at 15, went touring the country, when an agent of Knopf picked it up an began an aggressive advertising campainge which portrayed him as a prodigy, while omitting the fact that he was 19. The fact that it was a #1 New York Times Bestseller doesn't make it great; it merely means that enough people were tricked into buying it. About the only good thing I gained from this experience was a new pronunciation for Arya Stark, who I had previously pronounced AR-YAH, or AIR-yah, but whom I can now pronounce as AR-ee-ah. That's from A Song of Ice and Fire, by George R.R. Martin, which is a truly great work of fantasy, although not suitable for kids."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This book is distressing in the amount of attention it is getting, when from the very first page it is apparent that the author \\"borrowed\\" massive amounts of detail, motifs, characters, names,languages, etc. from other fantasy writers, especially Tolkien.

So I picked up a copy and was almost instantly transported to a magical, far-off land- Middle Earth, with a fantastical storyline- Star Wars. Yes, it is admirable for a 17 year old, but fiction cannot be measured against the age of the author, it must be measured against other great books, regardless of author's age.When I spoke to one of my students about how similar this storyline was to Star Wars, he asked how. So, I started a two-column list as I read. I now present this to you:Warning: SPOILERS!!

I'm just so surprised that Paolini's editors didn't see that almost every element of this story has been borrowed from other sources, like Tolkien, McAffrey and others. Very little is original. Cutting and pasting from different books and screenplays does not make an original story."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This review will list and refute most of the major defenses for this mediocre book.1. \\"He was only 15 years old\\"- Age is no excuse. If this were amateur writing on fictionpress.com, I would praise it. However, this is a published work of fiction and Paolini is a full-fledged author. His book should be held to the standards of every other fantasy writer.2. \\"I bet YOU couldn't write a book when you were 15.\\"- You don't have to be a writer to know a poor book when you see one. All you have to be is a good reader.3. \\"UR just jealous.\\"- Name-calling does nothing to defend Eragon. But maybe I am jealous. Not jealous for myself but jealous on the behalf of all those authors equal to or superior to Paolini who failed because they didn't have youth as a selling tool.4. \\"Paolini didn't plagiarize classics. He was only influenced by them.\\"- To be influenced means that he had original idea that was affected by the classics (Tolkien, Star Wars, etc.) It is quite clear that Paolini had no original idea to begin with. Instead, he combines secondhand story elements from different series while adding nothing of his own.5. \\"Eragon might be cliched, but everything in the fantasy genre is cliched, so it's OK.\\"- This is not a reason for unoriginality. It's an excuse. There are always new worlds to be explored. Also, this statement makes other inexperienced fantasy authors think that shameless ripoffs are actually acceptable, causing a decline in the quality of the fantasy genre.6. \\"The critics are uptight fantasy fanatics that are too busy fussing over details instead of just enjoying the story for what it is.\\"- You don't have to be a literature professor to know a cliche plot, disjointed writing, predictability, and overused stereotypes. These are major flaws that can keep any reader from enjoying a fantasy novel.7. \\"It's a children's book. You can't compare it to the classics.\\"- Paolini didn't mean for Eragon to be a kid's book. On his own website, he compares the \\"lyrical beauty\\" of Eragon to LOTR and Beowulf. If he's comparing his work to the classics, then why shouldn't we?"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"When first I attempted reading the book, I put it down within three chapters, as the word \\"derivative\\" pummeled my brain with the same febricity that dragons assault Paolini's imagination (and his imagination is assaulted with considerable frequency, according to Paolini on his website, hosted by Random House).It was with reluctance that I turned to the book again, and I did so with the singular intent of understanding the remarkable success of the book. We can debate the merits of this book without end, but not its stellar sales.And the reason for its success is simple. Not since The Sword of Shannara (or lesser works such as Niel Hancock's Circle of Light series) has heroic/high fantasy been dumbed-down to this level. Eragon is a book that requires no forethought whatsoever, little to no concentration, for all plot points are given away chapters in advance.I don't hold any of the Shannara works (and certainly not the lesser works, such as Hancock's and others) in high esteem. What Brooks did with The Sword of Shannara was to rewrite The Lord of the Rings for teenagers, and in that he succeeded quite well. He didn't write an original book, however. The characters in The Sword of Shannara were almost one-for-one reproductions, with slight variations, from LOTR. Paolini has done essentially the same thing, but whereas Brooks had only Tolkien to draw from, Paolini had many more sources to draw from. And these sources pepper the landscape of his book like a person's salad who forgot to say, \\"Stop!\\"We've heard that all art is imitation (and that therefore to imitate and even copy is OK); and that imitation is the highest form of flattery. In some aspects of art, literature, and life this holds true, but not here. There is too much imitation, and not enough originality. We have (from what I'm familiar of, anyway):* The Thirteen Forsworn (Jordan's Forsaken)* Elves on silver ships from across the sea (Tolkien)* Urgals and Kulls (Orcs and Uruk-Hai from Tolkien with bits of Trollocs blended in from Jordan)* Dwarves who are absolute reproductions of those from Tolkien, from their mountain city to their use of axes, and even the description of \\"hewing\\" heads off Urgals (er, Orcs)* A Shade (Jordan's Fade, although with an intriguing difference - and it's not the color of the hair)* Dragons and everything that comes with them (McCaffrey, although she doesn't seem to mind, if her blurbs mean anything)* A \\"magic-user\\" (former Dragon Rider) who refuses to reveal his true nature for no good reason other than to cause dramatic tension (take your pick from any of the lesser derivative works)* Ra'Zac (All wicked lords need hand servants...and they all get them, no different here)* Somebody says \\"Hellfire!\\" This is an uncommon oath in the \\"real\\" world, but not an uncommon oath to Thomas Covenant. There were a couple of other Covenant similarities, but I didn't make note of them.There are more, but this isn't intended to be exhaustive. Given what some truly great high/heroic fantasists have done (Tolkien, Donaldson, Martin, Williams, and to a lesser degree of late, Jordan), it is absolutely essential to make your own work your own. Is it easy? Not a chance. There are only so many original ideas, only so many different ways to write a high/heroic fantasy, but if you're going to do it, you can't just take what others have done, tweak it a bit, toss it into a blender, and put it out there as your own original work. This is NOT an original work.As to the writing itself, I refuse to be too critical. This was written and edited by a *teenager*. Some of his descriptions of physical objects and places are excellent, even for a \\"stronger\\" writer. Yes, he makes the mistake of confusing salt with adverbs. Most food contains salt of some kind, especially true for prepared foods, and it seemed that way with his sentences. There are adverbs galore. That's a nasty habit he needs to say good-bye to.As to the writer, well, after reading what he had written about his own work on his website, I lost some respect for him. Granted, this is still a very young person, but he is bragging of \\"wonders\\" to be revealed in his books, and says that \\"I strive for a lyrical beauty somewhere between Tolkien at his best and Seamus Heaney's translation of Beowulf\\". That's terrific to strive for, but his writing doesn't come close, and it's more than a little embarrassing, I would think, to make a comment like that. Maybe if Eragon stopped asking seven thousand questions so that Paolini could explain something that he could have done better through narration...but toward the end of the book I wanted Eragon's mouth closed with duct tape. When in Tronjheim, and talking to Angela, a very awkward segue occurs (one of dozens upon dozens in the book). Angela is speaking of Shades, and I'll admit that my eyes popped open a bit at the explanation because it was rather fresh and original. The Eragon ruins it by blurting out, \\"Why are you living so high up in Tronjheim? Isn't it inconvenient being this isolated? And how did you get all this stuff up here?\\" This just isn't sensible dialogue.My final feeling is: I was initially turned off, and then pulled into it as I picked it up the second time, but ultimately turned off. I've read The Lord of the Rings, The Wheel of Time, The Dragonriders of Pern, and they're all better books than this. On the Random House website, Paolini jokes that perhaps an epic trilogy was too much for someone so young. He couldn't have been more right.However, kids are reading this, and I'm in favor of almost anything that makes kids read more. Hence my three star rating. It would have been two stars otherwise."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"While the story kept me turning pages I kept feeling as if I where reading a poor reproduction of Robert Jordan's THE WHEEL OF TIME. Similarities range from the shape of the land on the map to the capabilities of the main character. Too many typical fantasy words crammed into every sentence give the impression of a high school writer getting carried away on a free writing exercise. Nothing special here other than the authors age...and it shows."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Cheese and rice. Has anyone else out there read Eragon by Christopher Paolini? I'd read the hype, a 19-year-old with a publishing contract. I was curious, and when I ran across the book at a book store last week I picked it up. Anne McCaffrey, who's written two of my favorite children's fantasy books Dragon Song and Dragon Singer, said that she gave it full praise. She must have been on acid.In a word the book is ghastly. The book opens with \\"Wind howled through the night, carrying a scent that would change the world.\\" Which is perilously close to \\"The wind wasn't the beginning... But it was a beginning.\\" Immediate reference to an evil Shade (humm, three letters off Jordan's fade) a non-human that controls Urgals (descriptions similar to trollics).There are items that ring of Jordan--shades and urgals, evil banding together and showing up where it never has before, the mentor is a bard just like Thom MerrilinEddings--a silver, oval marked palm, an orphan raised by relatives and not knowing his true heritage, not being able to stay because of discovery, the word and the will (he doesn't call it that, but his description rings of Eddings)McCaffrey--a dragon making the choice for rider, telepathic connection between dragon and rider, dragons classed by colorOn page 155 Eragon is having a conversation with his mentor. His mentor scolds him saying he should have used his magic to tell what someone in the town they were just in was thinking. This after warning him about the dangers of using the magic on 139. It's maddening and continual. It's like reading someone's unorganized notes. The contradictions are through out. This is just one example. There are MANY others.At the beginning Eragon is hunting in the Spine (more Jordan terminology, but closer in description his Misty Mountains, or Mountains of Mist). He is the only hunter who will go there. (Rand, Matt and Perrin) has a bow only he can pull (Rand). Anyway, he's a mighty hunter tracking a herd of deer, three nights away from home, he has a pack, a a knife, and a bow. But the next morning he also has a pan. Where did it come from. Yes I know it could have been in the pack, but that would have made it difficult to keep up with the deer. A pan isn't typical hunting gear. Camping? Yes. But he had no camp. He's following a herd which means travel rations.His family needs meat for the winter and has no money, but when he arrives home his uncle and cousin are eating chicken for breakfast. If you're poor, that's not what you're going to eat first thing in the morning. And on and on.I know that these items have been used by others and will be again. But never before have I read something that so clearly rang back to the original book.Language is a problem. To quote Nancy Springer, \\"When 'was' shows up, you have problems.\\" Paolini uses was five or six times a page. Yes, every so often I stop and count the number of times he uses was per page. So far I've counted eight different times. He uses 'was' five or six times a page. He cops out on 'had/has.' Passive. Inadvertent POV shifts. He tells. He tells. He tells. He contradicts himself. He tells.This book is a mess, and it got published. You remember the movie Dances with Wolves? Wind-in-His-Hair says, \\"All we know about this man is he has a smart horse\\"? Well, I think this kid has smart parents and a publisher thought that they could hype his age.This book could have been saved if it had been edited. I get the feeling it wasn't. I really want to stop reading the book, but it's kind of like a train wreck. You don't want to look, but you just can't help it.Has anyone else read it? Did you like it? What was I missing?Okay, I decided I've been to hard on this kid. I've taken a look at the chapter endings and found out that he has a disability. Poor Eragon has narcolepsy. He falls asleep on pages 18, 89, 128, 142, 212, 220, 249, 272, 316, 323, 392, 478. (These are chapter endings mind you.) I know that gives me permission to put the book away, and I wish I could, but something makes me continue to read.Ok. If falling asleep isn't bad enough, I have found no fewer than seven times where he's knocked unconscious at the end of chapters. (Pages 80, 134, 263, 266, 292 and just when I was getting worried about the lack, page 491). I know, that's only six. I didn't really know how to classify the stupor leading to sleep on page 233.Now keep in mind this in no way includes the loss of consciousness in the bodies of the chapters themselves. I'm still only on page 301, and the book has 200 or so more pages. I wish I could put myself out of my misery and burn the stupid thing, but I must finish it. There has to be some reason the book has gotten so much press. Other than the smart parents, which I now find out self published the book prior to it being acquired by Knopf.Oh, by the way. Does anyone have the definition of epic fantasy? Mr. Palini claims to have written one, but I can't seem to find it."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I was surprised to hear of Mr.Paolini, since he comes from Paradise Valley, a thirty minute drive from my house. Excited that this \\"celebrity\\" had published a work at such a young age, I decided to read Eragon. As countless other reviewers have said, I found dozens of ripped off story lines, and shallow characters. The truly amazing thing to me was, how simple and boring the writing style was for this book. Ideas put aside, I could not stand reading such terribly simple writing. I am not an English major, I am fourteen years old. I have a good imagination, and I felt if I put in the time I could write a much more interesting novel.However, Eragon has continued to be a New York Times bestseller. I predict the novel will slowly die out, or else it will continue to be a wildly popular trend. If the latter proves true, all it proves is that the general public needs to start reading some higher quality fantasy.If anything, Eragon has inspired me to write a novel. If he can do it, anyone can!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I read this book a few weeks ago and I was surprised by how good it was. I was so into it that I read it in 5 hours. I can tell that is was influenced by tolkien and many other great fantasy writers. People may say that it has all been done before but most fantasy books have similar plots and details while this book took a normal topic (dragons) and turned it into a great story that was very in depth and fun to read. The characters all had their special traits and they all fit in well with the storyline. The bottom line is that this book will keep you guessing until the very end"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I made a mistake when attempting to read this book, and that mistake was failing to pay attention to its target market. Unfortunately, following on the heels of the highly readable Harry Potter series which is targeted at young adults, I was sure reading this book would not hurt. Unfortunately this book is targeted for young adults, but unlike Harry Potter, it should ONLY be read by young adults.I am a fan of several hardcore fantasy writers including George R MArtin, Terry Goodkind, Terry Brooks, Robert Jordan, and even \\"fluffy\\" writers like Piers Anthony - and many more I cannot even think of on the spot. I can guarantee that if you have ever read adult fantasy novels such as those by the aforementioned authors, you WILL NOT enjoy this book.This book was written by a teenager and it shows. The language is alternatively simple and overdone. It does not read well. I find the simple phrasing and overdone verbosity to be annoying and boring. After gracing my eyes with the graceful phrasings of George R MArtin there is simply no way this poor book can compare.I don't feel the need to delve into what others have said about the plot - it's all been done before. There is nothing new or exciting to this story - UNLESS you haven't read other fantasy.I ALWAYS finish my books. But this one, I simply cannot. With my strong background in fantasy, it is just too simple and boring. My poor mother, who purchased this book for me, cannot understand. She says to me, \\"But Lisa said it's better than Harry Potter!\\" Unfortunately, Lisa is her nine-year-old neighbor who has never read a fantasy book OTHER than Harry Potter.My recommendations in short: If you have never read another fantasy book, you will probably enjoy this book. If you have read ANY books by authors such as those I mentioned, STAY AWAY. You will not be pleased you spent the money. This book belongs with its young adult target market, where it is sure to be enjoyed, or with light readers who have never picked up a fantasy novel."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Experience real fantasy and talent and pick up Tolkien, Rowling, Lewis, or even Jordan.Psst!

You get Aragorn....er Eragon. The greatest fantasy RIPOFF OF ALL-TIME!But hey, the masses don't know the difference (heck they love it) and Mr. Paolini is laughing all the way to the bank."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"The young genius, Christopher Paolini had graduated from high school at the early age of 15, so it's small wonder he has a great knowledge of history, norms, languages, etc. And he also has a GREAT sense of vocabulary for one so young...I was really blown away!Written in the traditional fairy-tale vein of \\"Star Wars\\", \\"The Lord of Rings\\", and even \\"Harry Potter\\", it is a coming-of-age story about a long-suffering young boy who was whisked away from his humble way of life by a sudden turn of events and found himself a legendary hero about to save the land - perhaps against his will. And it is told in such a breezy pace with beautiful, deft weaving of words that would quickly and easily conjure up colorful images as rich as those of Tad Williams' epic-spanning \\"Dragonbone Chair\\" tapestry. It is extremely fresh here - in spite of some negative reviews that the story is \\"predictable\\" and uses lots of fantasy cliches. That didn't stop the book from being such a great pleasure to read and follow the appealing characters into the thick of their spine-freezing adventures, of course.The new twist of this tale includes a sapphire-bright dragon who accompanies the boy and becames his faithful servant as they head into the great wars to ward off the approaching evil and help bring justice back to the blighted land. And, she - yes, a female dragon - is portrayed as a very intelligent and even witty creature that you, too would come to befriend.The young author is extremely lucky to have a very supporting family who even owns a publishing company to bring about this stunning book - even though it had gone through lots of editing process. But who is to blame the budding writer? He's just starting out exactly like his own hero!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"The only word for this book is \\"wow\\".

I was enthralled by the imagry of the book and the characters. The second book better come out really soon, because having to put this story off until it comes out is excruciating to me. Same as with the Harry Potter series, I don't want to have to wait three to four years before the next book comes out. When reading those books, I couldn't help but notice the similarities of Harry Potter to The worst witch.

I could hardly put this book down at night. Eragorn and Saphira's adventures with Brom and Murthag captivate your soul better than any many of the fantasies out there.Think of it as simmilar to the Lord of the Rings, except written in a simpler language. When reading LOTR you get caught up in the unknown words, and characters and names of places you can spend hours on one page, with Eragorn however, its a perfect mix of several characters, interesting names and places and also excitement.Eragon is a combination of: The Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter and Star Wars in some of the events that occur, mainly simmilarities to a \\"Yoda-like\\"character.

A corrupt king, a diabolical \\"shade\\", bands of bloodthirsty \\"Ugrals\\" (not my first choice of names), along with elves, humans, and dwarves combine to make a wonderful story. My only complaint was that it wasnt as well written as it could have been.When Eragon finds a strange flawless blue stone, he thinks he could get some money for it. Before he sells it, it hatches into a young dragon. The race was beleived to be extinct. The dragon grows faster and faster, and soon he doesnt know what to do with it. When the kings servants destroy his home and kill his uncle looking for the egg, Eragon along with his dragon Saphira, and a storyteller with a mystereous past, go after them to avenge the death of Ergagon's uncle.

The cover, beautiful. The map, engrossing. Angelina and the Werecat; a bit special, a bit mysterious.There are more BAD things than these GOOD things. There's the characters first.ERAGON: The name's similar to Aragorn. How come a farm boy doesn't marvel at the new world? He accepts his fate so calmly! It's as if he isn't really in this world of Alagaesia, but on Earth reading his own biography.ARYA: The name's similar to Arwen. She is too predictable. She almost dies but has enough strength to beat Eragon, so she's almost like a goddess. She's going to date our dear Eragon. We already knew that when Eragon dreamed his \\"prophetical\\" dreams.BROM: This storyteller suddenly is revealed his status. It was predictable, otherwise how could a normal storyteller have taught Eragon? He's just a copy of Gandalf, if you take out Gandalf's wisdom and power.SAPHIRA: Well, Saphira's amusing; no doubt Paolini tended her to be; but not truly amusing. She just hatches and seems to know even more than Eragon. Dragon or no, she's truly young and inexperienced.MURTAGH: Interesting character with an interesting past, but the future of this poor man is quite predictable.SHADE: The idea of Shades is too often-used.Then there are the plotlines. Arya getting poisoned was so predictable I put the book down then and there, but I read more to find out if anything interesting'll happen. Of course not. Arya was used; used to be Eragon's lover and his savior. Eragon needed a reason to go into the Varden welcomed.Also, we get to the 'species.' Dwarves are typical; disagreeable. Elves are almost gods, with their proud, scoffy way of handling everything. Urgals are EXACTLY Orcs. They're easily hatable. There's this new species of Urgals that can move fast without halting even in daylight, which is JUST LIKE URUK-HAI.I'm not saying that using other people's ideas is bad. COPYING them is. Paolini's given it a nice try, but you shouldn't just publish your try right away. He needs something special, his own style. Right now, his style is just a hodgepodge of Star Wars, Tolkien, Anne McCaffrey and such. If you think this book is interesting, which it is to some limit, I recommend you read other masterpieces by authors like Philip Pullman, Susan Cooper, D.W.Jones, Garth Nix, Tamora Pierce, and the authors mentioned above. If you're younger, Artemis Fowl series and the infamous Harry Potter is much better. When Paolini improves; which no doubt he will; read his series then. Eragon's immature yet. Look at his conversations, for example:\\"I want to stay,\\" he complained. &lt;-we know he's complaining.\\"You need a break and fresh air. Don't worry, you can go back soon enough.\\" consoled Horst. &lt;-we know he's consoling. Use 'said' when you can. You can read so many examples of these that you get used to it.It's like a blueprint of a fantasy trilogy. It's Lord of the Rings without the Rings of Power, the effectively evil Sauron and Saruman, the effectively wise Gandalf and Elrond. Then there's the almost unpredictable ending with Gollum biting off Frodo's finger. This book is predictable.If I ever read this book, it will be to see the ending and the evil of King Galbatorix. This is a seventeen-year-old's book - the characters are all seventeen years old."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"i just finished this book, and all i can say was that itsucked.

You speant a whole day writing down comparisons to other movies and books. You think yourself so amazing in picking apart a book (a great book, I may add)written by a kid and for kids. What a superior person you are. Most kids dont even like the old Star Wars movies these days. If it seems to be borrowing from other sources (as almost all literature does)than so be it. It is put to original context and has been a great form of entertainment for my children.

Tolkien's \\"Lord of the Rings\\" is considered the prototype and classic of the fantasy genre. Bring these two together--and you have \\"Eragon.\\"In \\"Eragon\\",the hero finds out he is a Dragonrider,an order that has been extinguished by the evil Galbatorix (shades of Darth Vader slaying the noble Jedi knights)Through his dragon,Saphira,Eragon gains magical powers (think of Luke Skywalker and the Force!)He has a mentor,Brom (okay,Obi-Wan Kenobi)After Galbatorix's Ra'zac (ravenlike Ringwraiths)slay his uncle (think of the death of Uncle Owen),Eragon&Brom; fight back.On the way,Brom,like Obi-Wan,is killed.Eragon goes to rescue an elf princess Arya(think Princess Leia!)in Gil'ead (basically the Death Star)with the help of a rogue,Murtagh (in other words,Han Solo)Both join the Rebel Alliance--I mean,Varden.Paolini uses the language&culture; of Middle-Earth with his elves,dwarves&Ancient; Language.In \\"Eragon\\",the morning star is called Aiedil--which sounds a lot like Earendil,the morning star in Middle-Earth(!)The book has its strengths--Paolini can describe languages&creatures;,and he has potential.Unfortunately,his blatant borrowing from Tolkien&Lucas--as; well as a flimsy plot structure--makes the book drag on.There's the scene where Eragon&Brom; have to look through shipping records to find the location of the Ra'zac (think Eragon,Dragonrider&CPA;!),the fact that every character weeps single tears,the unconscious Arya is tied to the dragon's belly (and spends most of the book comatose,though Paolini claims he likes strong female characters)\\"Eragon\\" is like some chocolates--it has a sweet shell,but in the inside it's hollow."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I bought this book, thinking it would be an interesting read, not expecting much from a book written by a seventeen-year old boy. Surprisingly, I could not put the book down. The more I read, the more interesting it got. I was amazed that such a young person such as Christopher Paolini could write such an epic tale. This book will surely fall in place by Lord of the Rings, or Harry Potter, even if people do not see it right now. I highly suggest this book."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I know this book has already recieved its fair share of reviews, but I felt I should put my two cents in.I have to start out by declaring my age: 13. About and around the age many say I should not be able to tell whether a book is bad or not, correct? Well, dead wrong. When I borrowed (thank God) Eragon from a classmate, I liked the cover and was surprised to find the author was very young. My expectations were heightened at this discovery but once I started reading the book, I was disappointed. From the beginning to end, Eragon is just a pain to read. I was first distracted by how the book read like bad FANFICTION - it was painfully obvious how hard he tried to make his boring and predictable plot exciting by using \\"big words\\" and fancy made-up language and drawing out scenes forever. Needless to say, it didn't work.Secondly, I couldn't get past the fact it sounded so similar to Lord of the Rings and the Pern series. I'm sure there are other similarities to many other books, in fact, I'd say Eragon sounds like a English writing assignment gone insane. It seemed like it took really broad aspects of the standard fantasy writings and mashed it all together. Nothing stood out as making these broad themes specific and original. Plus, I felt rather sick as I read the big hints of love between Eragon and that elf woman. Hollywood syndrome. *shiver*It was just a very messy, boring book. I didn't enjoy it and probably will only read Eldest just to see if his writing has improved. If not, I expect I'll just roll my eyes."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"In my opinion, Eragon (and others in the Inheritance Trilogy) was for me as guilty a pleasure as any chick-literature would be. Pleasure in the loosest sense of the word.As a young adult reader who loves fantasy, I enjoyed Eragon at first. It had action, it had some beautiful writing.Until I realized how unoriginal it was. As a young writer who hopes one day to get published, I was disgusted with the quality of the plot and the characters. The plot was recycled from many sources, from Lord of the Rings, from Ursula LeGuin, from Anne McCaffrey...the list goes on and on. Furthermore, the characters were flat to the point that would put a fanfiction writer to shame. (Fanfiction being stories based on published fiction, sometimes being very clich&eacute;d or of very low quality, and often written by teens. Don't get me wrong; many fanfiction writers are excellent.)The characters were who I had the most problems with; the plot can almost (not quite, but almost) be excused, as it is extremely difficult to come up with something new in the fantasy category. However, the characters fit too nicely into their niches. Garrow as the grudging, bitter, father-figure. Brom as the wise, mentoring, guide. What was most annoying was how perfect Eragon and Arya were. They were good-looking, they had positions of power, they were intelligent, they were educated, they were magically powerful, they were skilled swordsmen (swordspeople), they were skilled archers. I was about to gag on the self-idealization; Paolini said that he based Eragon on himself! I'm not going to insult his looks or his athleticism, as I know little about either, but there is no way that anyone could be all that.Paolini may have promise, but that is all buried underneath the over-marketing of his book and the fact that he was self-published. He has not improved within seven years (when he was fifteen to when he was twenty-two). I would appreciate the books more if I didn't know how easy it was for him to get them published.This may be a great book for young readers who are not mature enough to read J.R.R. Tolkien or Ursula LeGuin; if it gets them interested in reading, I'm all for it! But for people who want genuinely good fiction, it is a waste fo time and money."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Describe a rainstorm in 700 words or more, then continue like this for and entire novel. . .I would suggest that anyone considering reading this book just get the original or go rent the movie, it's called Star Wars. This novel followed that plot so closely that I checked the acknowlegements to see if it was intentional. I was shocked to see no mention of it at all. I was not shocked to find out Paolini's parents first published his work."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Before I begin with the actual review I want all you crazy Eragon fans to realize that I know that I am not the age group intended for this book. Well.... that's what I knew before I began. I was told that this was a teen fantasy and was written by a teen. However after the first few hundred pages I realized that this author actually thought that his shallow and bland story could be passed off as real adult fantasy, and then decided to write it that way.His inexperience shows no bounds at his first attempt at writing a story that doesn't know which sub-genre to place itself. All the elements are there for an adult fantasy, but it is the spirit and personality that are sorely lacking. A good adult fantasy is more than a really good story, it full of depth and complexity that inspires others to think and use the author's insights philosophically in their own lives. Eragon does none of that, and here's why:CHARACTERS:The idea of a farmboy suddenly chancing upon this wonderful destiny is really the core plotline for any fantasy story. It is unoriginal and has been done better by many other authors. It is obvious that the author intended for the reader to get attached to Eragon the most. However, this can't happen because Eragon's character developments are too sloppy and they change instantly to whatever emotion is needed for the particular situation. There are no transition periods between him feeling sad for the villager's deaths to him feeling desperation when trying to save Saphria. The human emotions felt by the characters are all the same and to the same degrees. Brom's anger at Eragon is exactly the same as Twins' anger; it is just too generalized. The strongest personality by far was Saphria, only because hers was the only dragon personality that was present.PLOTLINE:What can I say, overdone and taken itself too seriously. There was no depth, no \\"music\\" (as another reviewer put it). It did not inspire me to feel sad or happy. Too many things were stolen from other books, (from \\"true names\\" (Earthsea) to the \\"uncomfortable iron dwaren throne\\" (Song of Ice & Fire)), it was ridiculus. The idea of magical training is nothing new nor is the idea of linking minds with animals/humans/dragons. In fact I thought the most interesting and original part was the evil King himself (him alone, not that cheating band of 13 Forloarn or whatever they were called).WRITINGThe author's inexperience shows. The story was nothing more than a empty shell with nothing underneath. The dialogue was too simplistic and the description did not flow well the characters' actions. I got to the point when I was just kinda simming the description. It was like there were just blocks of paragraphs in between the story.In all it was not the amazing great book that it was hyped up to be. The only reason I gave this horrible work two stars was because I ended up finishing the stupid thing just to see what happened to the characters. I don't think I can stomach another serving of this teen-author who thinks to much of himself."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Okay, I know that writting a book takes an increadably long time and that the tried and true fantasy creatures(elves,dragons,drarves) have been used in nearly every fantasy book. However, that dosen't mean that you should stick with the same old creatues! Yes, the Werecat was origional and unique, but all the other characters are just so flat! Araya is the most powerful elf in the world, and yet she waits for Eragon to save her when she SOULD HAVE gotten out herself. I can deal with the \\"damsel in distress\\" character if she has some intresting qualities, but Araya is just flat.Don't even get me started on Eragon. If this book hadn't had him in it, I probably would have given it more stars. Eragon instantly knows everything, is more powerful than Brom, and yet he gets knocked out when someone TAPS HIM ON THE BACK OF HIS HEAD! I know that the heroes of books need to have some power, but they also have to have WEAKNESSES! The only weakness Eragon has is that he can't stop thinking about Araya(ZZZZzzzz...)Now I move on to Sapheria(I can never spell it right.) She is so motherly it drives me crazy! Every time Eragon comminicates telipathicly with her, she says things like \\"All will be well, little one\\" Why does she talk like she's been around for centuries when she hatched six months ago? Dragons are portraied as being wise, but again, WEAKNESSES, PEOPLE!Murtagh reminds me of my little cousin at the end of the book: \\"I won't tell you and you can't make me!\\" He's just like Eragon:whiney, selfish, and good at fighting, although Eragon is beter at it than him because HE'S ERAGON!Finally, I'll judge the plot. This is one of those\\"Hero&Co; wander around aimlessly then get attacked by something and then wander around again\\" books. If you're into that sort of thing, then I'm sure you'll like the plot! If you prefer some surprises in your books, then move on to another book. Every event and every battle was predictable, and I guessed Murtagh's secret almost immediatly.While this book was(supposidly) edited, I found numorous mistakes in it. I dont judge a book by its propper use of english, but I think that Eragon should have been edited again before it was published.Overall grade: F+Characters:D-Plot:F--------Climax:D+"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I was interested in this book because a teen wrote it and I like writing as well. However, I think adults are giving him too much credit just because he managed to write and publish a novel while he was still a teen. There are many other teen writers who are far better than him (for example, Amelia Atwater-Rhodes, who was a teenager when she had her first few novels published).This book drags on and seems like a very cheap imitation from the names and plot of the story, which seems interesting at first. The title character, Eragon, is annoying, temperamental, and I didn't like him the whole way through. In fact, the only character I really liked was Saphira, the dragon. The plot unclear and it seemed as though Eragon was going to no particular place for no particular reason.The only thing I truly liked is that Paolini had the ability to write well at times, although Eragon seemed to \\"ponder\\" quite a bit before falling asleep.I recommend that you don't by this book, but if you really want to read it, check it out from the library."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Ever wonder why a 15 year old gets published? The Outsiders did because it was actually a well written and quite simply remarkable book for a 15 year old to write. Eragon did because little Christopher's parents owned a publishing company.Far from being the \\"amazing\\" book that it was advertised as, it was nothing more than cheap imitation of other much greater works of fantasy. Reading through prior reviews i actually found a lunatic (and i truly shuddered when i read this) who claimed that Eragon was better than Lord of the Rings. Lord of the Rings so greatly outclasses Eragon that comparing the two would be like comparing stick figures to freakin Picasso.I'm not going to waste my time and energy on pointing out the many flaws (grammar, cliches, cliches, o god the cliches). Suffice it to say that Tolkien did it better, and probably could've done it better in his sleep. Oh and another rip off that i don't think many people have picked up on, is with David Eddings. Lets see, farm boy, ancient storyteller who has magical powers, teaches boy and imparts wisdom. Check Check Check. Introducing the Dragon Riders to use magic by making them do menial tasks until they got frustrated enough to use magic (that one made me almost want to cry). Oh and that the main character first uses magic when he burns the enemy trying to capture him (i really was crying at this point) The difference is that the Belgariad was a great work of fantasy by Eddings (great series if anybody wants a worthwhile read) where as Paolini wrote this kind of like he plagiarized a book report night before it was due and hoped to hell his teacher wouldn't notice (than again, maybe he did).The ONLY reason this book was saved from a one star vote was that it became a tiny bit interesting towards the end. The extra star is earned more as a way of hope. Hope that the next book will be better since he's (shall i dare and say it?) matured as a writer and gotten a much better editor.Oh and hiding behind your age is pathetic. I don't care if you're 15 or 150, you want to publish a book make sure its worth the trees we kill for it. If a 35 year old had written this novel who didn't have his parents own publishing company, it'd probably would've never gotten farther than a preliminary reading.Props to the marketing team for Eragon though, they made a boatload of money using Paolini's age.Just lay off the copying kid, use mommy and daddy's money to pay someone to be creative for you or something."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Not really. I just wanted you to start reading this. You know why? It's because this book is the literary equivalent of Spam. But I must admit something, though. I really liked this book. That is, until I started reading it. The novel itself does not live up to the splendid packaging. The problem with this book is the inconsistent storytelling. Sometimes he will be describing individual blades of grass, giving them names even. Then he will just jump into bland sections that are like slogging through quick sand. Another problem is that you never care about Eragon. So what if he passes out. So what if he is captured. The reader always knows that he will somehow be able to battle his way out with the skills that he learned out of a Magic For Dummies book or the Idiot's Guide to Sword Play. One moment he is a humble farmer, the next moment he is some kind of Medieval Rambo. They could make a good movie called Eragon vs. Predator.Paolini also ruined the best part of the book. When Saphira was born, the reader was mystified by her cute innocence. It seemed like something special and wonderous. And yet he smothers those essential fantasy feelings by making her grow up to fast and become omnescient.So basically, if you're over the age of 13, do not read this book, because it has nothing in it to entertain you. My copy is currently on a space ship heading towards the sun. On a final note, I am avidly looking forward to Paolini's next book, How to Write A Rip-Off Fantasy Novel."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Most people that truly practice and work at their craft (J.V. Jones is a good example) get better with experience. The Baker's Boy sold very well but was a poorly written book. By the third book of her Book of Words trilogy, Master and Fool, her writing had significantly matured. In fact, it was almost as if an entirely different person had written the books, so great was the improvement. You could tell that she really applied herself, and tried hard to be a *good* writer. It is likely that Paolini, as the intelligent young man we know him to be, will similarly grow in his craft. However, he's just not there yet.If this book had been written by, say, a Vicar of the Church of England, it would still be a poorly written book. Just because he's fifteen doesn't mean that you excuse the wealth of mistakes that exist here. I, for one, am going to read the second book, but if there isn't any evidence of improvement, that's probably going to be it. (For what it's worth, this is certainly a better book than Shadowmancer. By leaps and bounds. Shadowmancer was one of those books that deserved a -4 star review.)A work of art has to be judged as a stand alone work of art. You can't look at it through the glasses of the artist that created it, for if you are, then it's not a fair judgment.Any book, whether written by a fifteen year old, a thirty year old, or a seventy year old, that so freely copies other works and introduces so little originatliy, can NOT be a good book. This holds true for movies and other forms of art as well. Originality is one of the cornerstones to good art.I don't mean to say that this is not a tremendous accomplishment for a fifteen year old - it is. It's remarkably impressive. The problem is that the book itself is not similarly impressive.Granted, I certainly did not write a book when I was fifteen, so yeah - props to him for that. However, if I'd been home schooled living in isolation and my family ran a publishing company, I probably would have written a book much earlier than I did."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"All Paolini did was take characters, events and ideas from Tolkien, McCaffery and many other major fantasy writers (thank goodness he didn't get his hands on Cooper), throw them in the blender and spit them out through his own playdo mold. The story smells like he's sprayed the whole thing with Tolkien perfume. All that would be acceptable if the kid could write. Being 18 years old myself, i am in a position to criticize. He doesn't go deeper than the surface on any of his characters or invesitgate their motives from more than one angle. His entire writing style is flat and childish. The words themselves are not intersting to read. As Stephen King said, they call is prose for a reason. People need to stop praising him just becuase he is a nineteen year old. Get real.

But, being a critic is certainly much easier than being an author--a fact that has been made all the more clear to me as I trudge through my Master's thesis. Yes, we have seen many of the same characters and plot twists before. But, does this really distract from the enjoyment of the book? No. The worst flaw I found was that the book fails to build up to one monumental apex; instead, it offers a series of smaller, less momentous episodes--all of which are enjoyable.That said, I anticipate reading published works by all those who offered such proficient critiques of this work. I assume that their abundant knowledge of fantasy will produce great works that we all will soon see in bookstores and playing in the local cinema."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"First off, I'm not a typical fantasy reader. My genre is more horror (Stephen King / Dean Koontz). But when I saw the book on the shelf after seeing the preview for the upcoming movie I figured I would give it a try. And once I got to reading it, I couldn't put it down. I had the whole thing read in three days.I have not read any of the other fantasy authors, but did pick up on a lot of use from other stories. And there are parts that reminded me of Lord of the Rings. But it didn't bother me to the point of writing a bad review. Yes, I could tell that it was written by a young writer. But it was refreshing to read a writer as young as Christopher. I have certainly not know anyone his age to pick up such a project.I thought that the book flowed well, and didn't drag on a lot of irrelevant time. He was able to keep a great pace, and always wanting you to turn the page faster to see what happens to the characters. There really were not any slow times. Even the moderately slow times had enough going on to keep turning the pages.I will say that with the hundreds of fantasy books out there to choose from, a seasoned fantasy reader may have issues with it. But if you are looking for just a great story, with characters you can feel and be a part of for as long as it takes to read the book, then I would recommend it.I think it was a great book, by a young writer, to launch a promising career. I look forward to reading \\"Eldest\\", and then waiting for the final book."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This is an amazing book and I am very sick and tired of those who are constantly bashing both this story and Christopher Paolini. Anyone who believes that this is a horrid story is entitled to thier oppinions but I would like to see them write a story even half as good as Eragon. All the characters of this story are very well developed most with some mystery regarding their past. The character who is probably the most developed is Murtagh as nobody can tell for sure if he is truely evil or if he one day will come back to the side of good. This story will keep you guessing untill the very end."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Eragon, although extremely well written, seems to be several stories thrown into one. The book shares many of its ideas with classics, the most obvious being The Lord of the Rings and the Dragonriders of Pern. Some similarities including a romance between a human male and a female elf (by the name of Arya; could it be any closer to Arwen?), dwarves that mine and live in cities under the mountains, Urgals whose descriptions seem offly close to those of Orcs, and Kulls which are a hybrid species of Urgals that are tall and more ferocious (nothing at all like Tolkiens Uruk-hai).But, despite all these similarities and my descriminations against the book, I reluctanly have to say that I actually enjoyed the book.

We read it every night until midnight then got up and read more of it in the morning. We absolutely could not wait to see what would happen next. This is a great book for boys age 10-15. It's a challenging read that's full of action. This is definitly more in the vein of the Hobbit and Lord of the rings than Harry Potter. As for the complaints of predictibility and similarity to LOTR I would say that all fantasy of this nature is pretty much based on LOTR so you really can't slam the kid for doing what countless other authors (including Ms. Rowling) have done and adapting those characters to his own story.What I enjoyed about this book was the pacing. It rarely felt slow and over burdened with detail (entering the dwarf city was the one exception)which is a common problem for most fantasy writers.

While it does obviously trod upon the well-worn fantasy themes of Tolkien and others, that is not altogether a bad thing.

Don't try to critique it's flaws and inconsistancies. For heaven's sake don't blame the author for using Tolkien's themes and ideas, as Tolkien is the DNA of Fantasy itself, without whom the genre would not exist.

Thanks Chris, for you have given me another book to look foward to."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I think that the only thing that made this book so popular and acclaimed is the fact that author Chris Paolini wrote it at fifteen and published it at eighteen. By itself, it is nothing special. Being a teenage fantasy writer myself, though still unpublished, I have a lot of respect for Paolini for writing the book, but not for the book itself.I felt that the book was less than average on the great scheme of fantasy, though I have seen worse. To sum it up, this book could very well be the bastard child of Lord of the Rings and Dragonriders of Pern. These two major influences were way too prominent, so this book did not feel like anything I hadn't read before. There is also a pretty visable Star Wars influence. I am just waiting for the bad overlord dude Galbatorix (worst fantasy name ever) to be archetypal hero Eragon's father. I would laugh so incredibly hard, but I hope that isn't the case.The major error in this book is that Paolini draws too heavily from sources other than his own inspiration, which makes the book bland and unoriginal.I did not really like the writing style either. It feels childish, yet attempts to be more sophisticated by throwing in random vocabulary words that I know would not actually be in the author's vocabulary. Cool it with the thesaurus, Chris. However, there were a few passages that were quite beautifully described, but you have to look really hard for them. Otherwise, I hope that Paolini improves his writing for the next book. I am only going to buy it to see if he develops as a writer.The plot is nothing new. It is a regurgitated version of the stereotypical fantasy with the aforementioned influences being heaviest. I won't bother going into details.And the characters. The characters bothered me a lot. The Dragon, Saphira, is by far the best character in the book. She strikes me as being very catlike, and I absolutely love cats. Paolini must like cats too. Eragon, the main character, simply pissed me off. He did not strike me as being the least bit special, having no edge or dimensions, or particularly intelligent. Also, he has absolutely no dark side at all, something I find necessary in a well-developed character, which makes him somewhat shallow and excessively righteous. I am sick of righteous characters. The female character, an elf by the name of Arya, seems almost oversompensating for feminine equity, but otherwise has not been discussed in great detail. But for now, Arya Stark in Song of Ice and Fire is a much better character. I hope Paolini knows that the name Arya is already taken. Oh well. Yet there is a striking coincidence . . . Aragorn and Arwen . . . Eragon and Arya . . . hmmmm. I don't feel like talking about the rest of the characters because they bother me.Overall, this book is a collage of existing fantasy with a muddled pedigree of all the other fantasy books we've read. I found Eragon amusing as a time killer and a procrastination tool for homework, but it was lacking in the vast majority of possible categories for review. If it had been given to me in manuscript form, I would have taken my red pen to it and ripped it apart (figuritively). What it really needs to be a good book is about five more drafts. I can only hope that the next one is better."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I read Eragon after stumbling upon amazon.com and finding out, at some point, that the author is roughly the same age as I am. I just had to see what the hype was all about, after all. What I discovered is that Eragon reads exactly like fanfiction, a good one, but fanfiction nonetheless, in the sense that it is hauntingly similar to many online fiction I've read in the past. In fact, I'll go as far as to say that I've read a few of those that were even better than this.It has a clich&eacute;d storyline, but it wasn't that bad. The problem is that his writing is too difficult to focus on. It becomes tedious to plod through his neverending descriptions of everything around and beyond the current character being focused on. This is similar to: A person is walking. Behind him, the trees are green, branched, speckled, with lots of blue dots all around. The ground beneath him is a bright purple and has a strange marshmallow texture........you get the gist. I pity the author, though, as it must have been difficult filling up each and every crevice in his work with all these unecessary details. The thing is, they distract from whatever flow the story has......which brings me to my next point. There's not an actual 'flow' in the story, as there is a flow with my cat's smelly, cracked teeth. The basic premise is that Eragon travels from one place to another, with some stuff that aren't really important enough happening in the middle. The story jerks up and down, giving me the impression that there is no ending to look forward to (well there was, but it's more of a, \\"It's over!\\" kinda feeling rather than a, \\"I want more...\\" thing). It took me two or three weeks to finish this book, simply because I felt no desire to read any more than half a chapter each time (and I'm a fast reader who can swallow up a book in a day, given my busy life).Then there's the characters. Oh yes, you've heard; flat, one-dimensional, clich&eacute;d like peanut butter on toast. When Eragon ponders on his existance, I do not feel his sorrow, only an overwhelming sense of grief over the fact that it could have been way, way better. Same with Saphira's basic existance, overall. In six months, she grew to be this wise, majestic creature...? I would have loved to see her 'grow', instead of be TOLD that she grew. I would have enjoyed seeing her feelings towards Eragon develop, and not just BE there. Which is probably my third (or fourth, I can't remember) gripe about this book. Everything is 'told', rather than done. There is no storytelling, only explanations (there seemed to be 80% more explanation than dialogue in this thing).A good fiction, but I have seen better. Being a teenager, he is praised dearly, but if you look around, you will see better work out there, even by people younger than he is. And the good thing about that is, you don't even have to pay for them..."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":". . . not a thesaurus. In the first few pages, I wanted to duck to avoid uninteresting flying adjectives. And you can't use the word \\"stuff\\" in a fantasy novel. And fantasy characters get sick. They do not throw up.I'm excited about the fact that this book was written by a teenager, but I don't think we should ignore the rules of style and usage (and plot) just because he's 19. There are some mature ideas in the book (e.g., Eragon's discovery of his own mortality), and some of the passages obviously thought-out (good description of a battle scene -- not easy to do), but the characters'actions are inexplicable (people show up in places with no explanation of why they are there; characters express strong emotions or sarcasm that has no connection to the content of a conversation) and the language is . . . what a 15 year old thinks a fantasy character would say. In general, the writing is distractingly unsophisticated."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I agree with other Amazon reviewers who say that Eragon is a lot like Lord of the Rings. However, it also bothered me that it is a LOT like Star Wars! This is what I mean: Eragon (Luke) is a young farm boy who lives with his poor Uncle Garrow (Owen). He doesn't know anything about his past, but finds out that his mother chose to leave him at the farm. And there are hints that Galbatorix, (Anakin/Vader) who was a benevolent Dragon Rider (Jedi Knight) who became evil and took down the whole order of peace, is actually Eragon's father. Now that Eragon has a dragon, (similar to Luke obtaining the Death Star plans from Artoo) he is a threat to Galbatorix's Empire (Yes, it's actually called the Empire, just as in Star Wars) and will be hunted down. Brom (Obi-wan), who is considered a kind of crazy old story teller (just as Uncle Owen calls Obi-wan a crazy old man) decides to help Eragon on his quest. Brom was apparently an influential Dragon Rider himself, but is now in hiding from the Empire. (Just like Obi-wan). Eragon's farm is torched for what he knows, and his uncle is killed. (Just like Star Wars!) Brom and Eragon start traveling, and Brom teaches Eragon about his apparently inherent ability with magic (the Force). Along the way, Brom ends up sacrificing himself (like Obi-wan's death), and Eragon meets a gruff, mercenary type guy named Murtagh (Han Solo). Eragon gets captured, finds out an Elven princess is imprisoned as well, and he and Murtagh pull off a perfect replica of Han and Luke rescuing Princess Leia from the Death Star, complete with Murtagh disguised as one of the guards.These are just the parallels I found with Star Wars; there are many more pertaining to Lord of the Rings which other reviewers have already mentioned. My point? It's okay to have a few similarities with other popular works, but there is a point at which you are simply copying. People who believe that Paolini has some kind of divine fantasy inspiration are simply not looking at Eragon objectively. Christopher Paolini, whether doing it intentionally or not, has created a mismash of elements from other works, and is passing it off as something that should strike us all as wildly original. I have a degree in creative writing, and while this does not make me an expert, I could see something in Paolini's writing that ANY student of creative writing will learn in their very first writing course: people who are beginners will invariably copy from other works they have enjoyed, either intentionally or subconsciously. When you become a more mature writer, regardless of whether you began writing at age 15 or 75, you learn to develop your own style and orginality. I don't see orginality of expression or plot in Mr. Paolini's work, not in the smallest measure. Don't get me wrong; the quality of his prose is okay for someone who apparently started Eragon when he was 15. But, in my opinion, it's NOT nearly the quality you'd expect from someone who now has national acclaim, and has been on David Letterman and CNN. His age has gotten him this press, not the quality of anything he's done. It makes me sad that there are so many writers out there who have great talent, but because they did not promote their books like Paolini has (with, ahem, his parents initially publishing it for him) they will never receive widespread recognition.(...)."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I read this book because of all the hype about it--a lot of people I knew that typically didn't read a whole lot loved it--and was somewhat disappointed. Sure, the adventures and complex plot are appealing at first, but there are many fundamental flaws. For example, the whole book is written like a movie, with descriptions that sound more like they came from a screenplay. This book has interesting concepts, but not much soul. Plus, the main character, Eragon, is not the least bit likable. Despite the constant predictions that he is of great ancestry, that he will be great and noble, he remains common and annoying throughout the book.The greatness of some of the other characters in this book--the werecat, Saphira, and the witch, to name a few--cannot justify the lack of depth in Eragon and his elf crush, Arya. I can't say that i didn't enjoy the book, because it did have a lot of great characters and fascinating scenes and concepts, but Eragon and the crazy unrealisitc plot kind of ruin the entire experience of reading this book. To be completely honest, \\"Eragon\\" feels like a shoddy mish-mash of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" and \\"Harry Potter.\\" The elves with pointy ears, dwarves, dark lord, and orc-substitutes all belong to the former, and the magic belongs to the latter.This book isn't bad for a casual read (if you're not used to reading books that are considered classics), but it really boils down to nothing more than a fun makeover of classic fantasy stories with little actual substance."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Borrows HEAVILY from other fantasy novels, most notably the Pern series by Anne McCaffrey.

I enjoyed the book, but I don't feel it deserves all the credit and publicity it has been getting."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"The first spotlight reviewer (impressive for...) pegged my opinion of this book precisely. Until now, I didn't know the author was seventeen and that explains everything I do not like about the book. The author is obviously imaginative (even if he does borrow most of his ideas) and unquestionably very talented for his age but, as a reader of Tolkien, Rowling, Dan Brown, etc., I will finish the book only because I paid good money for it. While I can't explain HOW a J.K. Rowling does what this author doesn't, I can recognize when it is missing. There is NO character development in Eragon and very little story development. I keep expecting clever origins for story elements (the name Eragon, for instance) but they never turn up. And, frustratingly, every character seems to speak with the same voice, Mr. Paolini's evidently.I too, look forward to reading Christopher Paolini's work in about 10 years, shortly after I read Mr. Paolini's own harshly critical review of his early work. Hopefully his success and acclaim will not stand in the way of his development as an author. If it doesn't he may become a great one."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This is a good book for a first attempt. I enjoyed the overall story and hope the other books get better. Nothing is really original, but it was a nice spin on the arch-types. Chris uses a LOT of flowery language, but if you look at his website that appears to be the way he talks. I was mentally distressed at his description of the village ravaged by Urgals near the beginning involving a spear in a heap. When you read it, be prepared! The battle scene in the end is a bit silly, the \\"dragon armor\\" doesn't make much sense and the ending is abrupt. It is clear that he wanted this to be a much longer story, but cut it short and turned it into a trilogy. Or maybe for the economic reasons, he envisioned it as a trilogy from the beginning. In any case, the book does not live up to the hype and do not believe for a second it is in the same class as Harry Potter."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I didn't know anything about Eragon when I picked it up from the library, except that I'd seen it around a great deal and thought it would be worth a read. Thus, I didn't realize it had been written by a teenager until I reached the \\"about the author\\" bit at the end of the book. Immediately I thought, \\"That explains a lot.\\"I won't go into the story being derivative -- it's been well-covered and that's honestly not my main problem with the book. For me, it's not that the plot and characters in Eragon are derivative -- it's that they're unrealistic and poorly done. I first realized something was off early in the book, (spoilers ahoy) when Eragon realizes that the Nazgul -- er, Ra'zac -- have found his village. Instead of taking him back to warn his family Saphira flees with him into the forest, and as a result his uncle is killed. You'd expect Eragon to be at least momentarily fussed at Saphira over this, yes? It's her fault his uncle is dead, after all. But Eragon doesn't seem annoyed with Saphria in the slightest. This is pretty much the pattern for the entire book: characters become upset when the plot requires them to be, calm down when the plot dictates it, then remember their grievances again when (you guessed it) they are once again useful as a plot point. The characters had no sense of emotional reality to me -- they responded to the events around them as though they were merely plot elements, not living, breathing people.Moreover, the speed with which Eragon went from a farm boy to a warrior and magic-user without peer (and learned to read to boot) was simply laughable. Can anyone say, \\"Harry Stu?\\" Nor did very much character growth seem to occur as a result of these changes.Besides the character problems, the story itself is anything but tightly plotted. Characters spend most of their time going from Point A to Point B, where something happens which is generally totally unrelated to the reason they originally went to Point B. This unexpected event requires them to go to Point C, and so on and so forth. Along the way they spend a lot of time relating backstory. The backstory comes in dribs and drabs, with a great many characters keeping secrets from each other without any apparent motivation for doing so. This seems to be meant to provide suspense, which would be more effective if the secrets had actually been surprising or interesting when eventually revealed.I'm aware that this is a children's book, but that's no reason to hold it to a lower standard. You wouldn't eat healthy meals yourself and feed your children junk, would you? So why feed junk writing to childrens' minds? It's especially unnecessary in the realm of young adult fantasy, as bookshelves in bookstores and libraries are TEEMING with excellent YA fantasy, much of it as good or better than the average adult fare. (Off the top of my head I'd suggest trying out Diana Wynne Jones, Tamora Pierce, Diane Duane, or Jane Yolen instead.)Don't get me wrong, Paolini obviously has talent and I'm sure he'll write an excellent fantasy novel someday. Eragon isn't it."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Sorry kid, but its obvious which authors you read and that you're just a kid! The dragon is cool, but this book is so much of Anne McCaffrey's work that its ridiculous. It amazes me that he was able to publish this, with all the similarities to her work. The dragon hatches and Impresses on a boy, knows her own name, and communicates with only him (maybe someone else if she feels they are important enough) through telepathy. Sound familar? Also, as mentioned numerous times, there is the incredible parallels to Tolkien. They even talk about wizards duels, which is very Potter-ish. I understand that it is difficult to write an interesting novel, and this isn't bad for a first shot, but it is not something that should have been inflicted on younger readers, or those who haven't read decent fantasy fiction before. I will read the next book, maybe he has improved in his writing and the next one will be a real book, with original ideas and such. To be fair, he did come up with an original idea though; the dragon would sit in her egg until the person she was destined for came along. that was kind of cool. not cool enouhg to carry a whole novel, but a good start. Read McCaffrey, Rawn, Tolkein, or Rowling before this. Pretty map in the front cover though..."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Interesting book but not very original. I think Paolini didn't realize that his book was just a giant conglomeration of a bunch of cheesy fantasy books. But, I must say it was rather \\"thrilling\\" and did keep me going for a while.

I rank this up there with the lord of the rings and even the harry potter series.

The stone turns out to be a dragon egg. After the dragon hatches from the egg, Eragon secretly raises it. Eragon names the dragon Saphira. One day, the dragon goes crazy and takes Eragon deep into the Spine. When Eragon and the dragon return to their home, they find that it has been burnt down. Eragon's Uncle Garrow is found dead in the rumble. Eragon and Saphira set out in search of the people responsible for this tragedy.The plot makes you want to keep reading until the end of the book.

Sound familiar? Or what about an ongoing struggle against an evil empire led by an elderly sorcerer as a guide and assisted by a remarkable fighting human, a bearded dwarf who uses an ax, and an elf who is an archer. Ring any bells? All right, before you Eragon disciples lash out, I did like this book. I just couldn't help drawing the obvious parallels to Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings. I suppose Paolini didn't intend the similarities, but even the language he uses sounds so much like what I heard in the LOTR trilogy. The author is obviously brilliant and he tells a good story. And, I suppose one should expect some similarites among all fantasy creature tales. So that's why I still give it 4 stars and say, \\"Good job\\"."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I am not going to repeat other reviewers' comments on ERAGON's similarities to Tolkien, McCaffrey, Star Wars, and so forth, but I am going to point out the ridiculous writing. Here are the problems with the prose in ERAGON:1. This book would be infinitely better if someone cured Mr. Paolini of the middle-school English class misconception that \\"said\\" is a boring word, and that adverbs add richness to prose. Please! Why does Eragon have to \\"complain,\\" \\"reply,\\" \\"comment,\\" etc. when it is obvious from what he says that he is complaining, replying, commenting, etc.?2. The melodrama is very annoying. Dead bodies, lots of blood, evil creatures--all portrayed in ridiculous flowery language. More blood does not mean more excitement.3. Metaphors are only useful if they illuminate what you are saying. If they're just stuck in, they weigh the story down. Arya's tear is a \\"liquid diamond\\" (there is no such thing). One of Mr. Paolini's essays on his website compares editing to \\"hot pieces of bamboo being driven into my sore eyeballs\\" when most of us have never felt that, and bamboo and eyeballs seem to be chosen randomly as a metaphor for pain. It is clear that Paolini did not use his editor as much as he should have.I do, however, give the young author two stars--one for trying and one for suppyling me with several hours of amusement."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This book may seem like lord of the rings but it is nothing like that.

There's hardly a fantasy book in existence that doesn't have elves, dwarves, or dragons, and I don't think the dragon rider concept is even new. So why is it so popular? It probably is a combination of the fact that everyone wants to see how good a job a fifteen-year-old kid can do, and the fact that, cliche as it is, it's much more well-written than most. I've found that if a book has a good, intiguing plot, I'll read it, even if it's badly written -- even if it's REALLY badly written (I'm referring specifically to the Cirque du Freak series -- also recommended if you're an undemanding person). After reading Eragon, I've discovered the reverse is also true. If a book has a generalized plot, but is written with clarity and talent, I'll read it and (eventually) finish it. Paolini's obvious descriptive talent does do something to elevate this book above its thousands of identical siblings. If he could just come up with some of his own ideas (not to say there's much left to work with) this would easily be one of the best fantasy books written in a long time."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This was a lovely read for me. I like fantasy very much. It was a fairly easy read and very enjoyable. I do agree that it wasn't entirely original as I would have liked. I kept being reminded of Tolkien like the other readers have commented, the elves characteristics are the same, as are the dwarfs and many other things written in the book. Also, does anyone but me kind of feel a little bit of a starwars theme here? riders - jedi, evil empire - evil empire, old, powerful evil king - old, powerful evil emperor, ect. lol. But all the same, who cares. Artist and writers are always inspirated and have used the same flavor from other artist and writers for years. At least the author of ERAGON used the ideas with taste. And even though there is a lot of familiarity in his books, there is also much of his own ideas and style that are very different.

But guess what: Lot's of teens write novels. Most of them are better. the only reason this 'book' was published is because of Paolini's parents doing it for him. It's much easier to get your book out when the editors are mummy and daddy dearest. Think of what adult authors have to go through. you need to send out a manuscript, and the people reading may not like it! wow! they may not even like you!Admit it; if he had written this as an adult it wouldn't have been published. I can write more creatively than him, and I never say anything good about my own work. The story and characters are blatantly stolen from other books and films. That's okay to do when you're nine years old. Heck, me and my friends used to write rip off redwall books at that age. But when 700 page fan fiction is being published and considered good for something which a teen wrote, then that truly is age discrimination."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This is the absolute worst book I've read in my entire life! And I've read some pretty awful books. My main squabbles with this book:1) as everybody has mentioned, the story-line has been totally copied off of waaayyy better books.2) as everyone else has mentioned, the names are totally copied of off waaayyy better books.3) the descriptions were of absolutley everything but Eragon. And the descriptions were a total waste of time. He wasted a whole 2 pages describing to the finest detail a map of Middle Earth--oops, Alagaesia that the readers could have seen by flipping back a few pages (most of which were filled with unnecessary descriptions).4)as another reviewer has mentioned, Eragon looks a bit like Paolini. Arya, Eragon's love interest, looks a lot like Liv Tyler. Coincidence? I think NOT!!5) the \\"ancient language\\" was horriffic. there were too many consanants jumbled together. Example: brsingr. I did NOT make that word up! Some words from the Urgal language was taken straight out of Tolkien's Orkish dialect.6) The Urgals are no more than stupid cavemen with horns and we are constantly being TOLD how evil they are, yet we never SEE how evil they are. Quite unlike Tolkiens perfectly sinister orcs.7) Because of the way Brom talks about Eragon's mother, it makes it seem as though Brom is Eragon's father. But it would be hilarious if Galbatorix/Darth Vader/Evil Emperor/Sauron was his father. Example: \\"'No, Eragon!' stated Galbatorix misteriously. 'I am your father!' 'NOOO!' wailed Eragon piteously.\\"8) Paolini's fear of the word said. I can't recall ever reading the word said in the entire book! Plus, he'll use an adverb describing exactly how Eragon asked. For example: \\"How?\\" inquired Eragon, curiously. Quite unnecessary. I nearly threw the book across the room when I read \\"Sorry,\\" apologized Brom.9) did it ever occur to Paolini that not every single sword has a name? And it would be impossible for a guy to be able to hold a one-handed 5 foot sword. The sword was described as being \\"rather heavy.\\" Real swords were not really heavy, nor were they five foot long. Even the great Claymores were no more than four feet long, and weighed little more than four pounds.10) his knowlegde of battle tatics seemed to be learned solely from watching the LOTR movies. But the fight scene isn't half that good. It is all told from Eragon's point of view. And he seems to be able to have time, in the mist of fighting horribly dnagerous Urgals, to look around and watch what all the named characters in the book are doing, before turning around and fighting an unsuspecting orc--I'm sorry, Urgal.Another thing is the way people give him slack for being so young. PLEASE! It only got published for two reasons:1) his parent's were publishers and thought that there son was a genius. They would of published any thing he wrote.2) he met the Random House editor on a book tour and became friends. She promised to get his book published if he wanted.I could go on, but I won't.

You'll be much happier without it."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"The plot is almost entirely ripped off from Star Wars, with names from Tolkien and a touch of Anne McCaffrey.

Ouch!Paolini has potential, but if he had been twice his age, this would never have been published--except by his own family's press. It is akin to fanfiction--excellent for fanfiction, but not up to the standards of children's/YA fantasy. It lacks originality--and please don't tell me how all fiction is derivative. Of course it is--that's why a new book has to have something special for it to be worth reading. And this one just isn't special.What really bugs me is how many librarians and book reviewers have missed all of this, and can only wax poetic about how the author was only 15 when he wrote this--SO WHAT? This is just not good enough to be getting on \\"best of lists\\" and garnering 5 stars from well read adults who are supposed to read CRITICALLY.Our kids deserve the best--and that includes reviewers who can recognize the best in children's literature and not fall for the sort of hype this book has generated"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"The young author and his parents (who suspiciously own a publishing company) are obviously trying to capitalize on the Harry Potter fueled spotlight on the fantasy genre. Young Mister Paolini, while obviously a fan of reading fantasy, should be cautioned that it takes more than that to be able to write good fantasy. As the subject matter has become mired in cliche over the decades, what now distinguishes good fantasy is a mastery of language, of plot construction, and of character development. In Eragon, the title character is far from sounding his age and lacks the natural bewilderment expected of a young boy thrust into epic destiny (see David Edding's Belgariad). The use of dragons and mental communication is nothing that hasn't been done, and the so-called plot twists are all too predictable. The writing itself is clumsy, as one might expect from a 15 year old boy. Even the naming conventions and attempt at inventing languages bear the signs of one who reads but sadly cannot duplicate Tolkien's craft. On the bright side, future books from Young Paolini, who must be getting older and more experienced as he enters into his twenties, can only improve on this beginning."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I read \\"Eragon\\" as part of my own market research as a writer of teen fiction, and fail to see why it is getting praise. It's a far cry from unique, set in a fantasy world like most others. While I was interested enough to find out what happens next, the plot was never really remarkable. Plot \\"twists\\" are encountered with a slight nod. The psychology behind the characters is loose and some developments are sketchy (a woman on one side of the world conveniently appears on the other side of the world, and got there before Eragon, though it took him a week). And the ending...wait...that's the ending? I am reminded of my early efforts with managing long plots. I had the beginnings down, but the ends rushed to an impatient resolution. I think this book is 90% hype, and I'm not impressed that he started writing when he was 15. So did I, and while my 500-pages of amateur effort commit many of the same sins as Paolini's published work, it's a better read, and unpublished (thank god!)."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Last winter... I checked Eragon out from the library. About 50 or some pages in, I finally closed the book, put it down, and returned it to the library.Just as a baseline, here are some fantasy-ish books I read: Rowling, Tolkien, McCaffrey, Diana Wynne Jones, Lloyd Alexander.... some Tamora Pierce, Lawrence Watt-Evans, a little Terry Pratchett.... Roald Dahl, Bruce Coville, Arthur C. Clarke (ok, sci-fi)...So. Eragon. It... wasn't that good. The first few pages almost made me retch with its awful inexperienced writing. Some sort of big scary troll things were being described; or rather, the writer was doing his very best to describe how scary they were.Quite honestly, the writing was right out of some ill-written amature fanfic (although the spelling was better). But I decided to give the book a chance, and plowed on. I mean, I've read many online fanfics; good fanfics, very well written fanfics, and a bunch of bad fanfics. I'm used to all sorts of writing, and I know some fanfics can get unexpectedly better as they continue.Anyway, the book Eragon. I dragged my way through the first few pages... then, I think it got kind of interesting... I don't remember too well... Mainly I remember how grating the writing was. Reading Eragon was like trying to chew on sand-sprinkled spinach. Besides the pure writing style, a lot of other reasons have been covered already; ie, too much of Eragon came from somewhere else. For instance, the relationship described between the boy and the dragon -- the very word structure, I swear, could've been lifted out of McCaffrey's Dragonrider books.And for some reason, I was supposed to think that blue dragon was wonderful. Well, that dragon was blah, I didn't get that dragon's personality, I couldn't figure out if that dragon had a coherent personality at all, and I couldn't understand why the protagonist fellah Eragon or whoever was so smitten by the dragon. I wasn't connecting to this Eragon world at all. I finally gave up reading the book.(Since I got turned away too early, I won't try to review the plot.)I hear a movie is being made of this book. That just gives me the chills. But... Then again, there are a number of very nice movies based on awful books. We'll see.So like I mentioned in the review's title.

Even if it's absolute trash, you know that the author took some time out of his or her life to create what they might think is a beautiful work of art. And it isn't easy. As a creative writing major and someone who has written books since the age of thirteen, finishing a story isn't an easy task. But it is easy to avoid cliches, bad syntax, thesaurus-syndrome, and the like. When I read Eragon, I wasn't blown away. I wasn't like 'wow' as I was when I read The Outsiders (a piece of teen-written fiction that deserved every bit of praise it got, might I add). In fact, I was sad. Sad that we are so easily impressed by something all because of his age and not judging it by what it really is. It's simply a big mess that could have been avoided if he would have waited a few more years and taken more time with this story. It just wasn't a good book. It reminded me of a bad reproduction of Lord of the Rings mingled with Star Wars, making for a bad slew that made my eyes bleed. And the characters were absolutely ridiculous. I hated Eragon to the point of where I wanted to reach in the book and throttle him. And it isn't a good thing for an author when people hate the lead characters and root for the bad guys, which is what I was doing. I was hoping for the Ra'zak or Galbatorix to rush to the scene and...well, you get the idea. The only decent character was Saphira.I hope he is the type who will read reviews and grow from them, instead of getting hostile and saying 'screw you guys; I LIKE the way I wrote it' even if the way he wrote it was cliche. And if he learns from his past mistakes, I'm sure he will be an excellent writer.

It's a well written, very clearly detailed novel, but I couldn't grasp the love other people have shared about it. I loved the magic aspects of the book, especially Eragon's learning about his abilities and seeing them grow, but I didn't care for him as a character. He has this huge, sweeping adventure in which he bonds with multiple characters that I didn't care about either. The main focus on the novel, beyond Eragon's journey, was his relationship with the dragon Saphira. While he clearly bonded with her, I had trouble thinking of her as anything beyond a pet he could communicate telepathically with. They obviously connected on a deeper level than that, but either due to my limited knowledge of dragons or that I lack the love others have for the creatures, I didn't \\"get\\" it.While it wasn't quite my thing, I can see the appeal of Eragon.

Having read a few books on the fantasy genre, I somehow already had an idea that I'm in for an adventure. What type of adventure? I know not - yet.Eragon is a story about a young boy named Eragon, who lives on the outskirts of Carvahall and hunts in the Spine, a \\"range of untamed mountains that extended up and down the land of Alagaesia\\" where \\"strange tales and men often came from those mountains, usually boding ill.\\" It is believed that Eragon is the only one who has gone in and out of the Spine unharmed and lived.It is during one of his hunting trips when he comes upon a blue stone which he tried to sell to traders for money so he could buy meat for his family: Uncle Garrow and cousin Roran, whom he live with. But no one would buy the stone after learning he found it in the Spine and so he kept the stone in his bedroom. Unbeknownst to him, this smooth, blue stone will drastically change his life.In the middle of the night, a few hours after hearing the story of the legendary Dragon Riders, a squeak came out of the blue stone that woke Eragon. It was rocking so violently that it cracked and out came a dragon. So it wasn't a blue stone after all but a dragon egg. How to take care of dragons, Eragon had no idea but his old friend, Brom does so to find out more about dragons, he goes to Carvahall and visits with Brom and comes home to his dragon and names her Saphira.The tragedy of Garrow's death by the powerful hands of two strangers instigates the changes and threats to Eragon's life as he pursues the Ra'zac - non-human creatures \\"who are stronger than any man and can jump incredible heights, but they cannot use magic\\" - to avenge his uncle's death. With the guidance, training and wisdom of Brom, Eragon learned how to defend himself with Zar'roc, a sword from a fallen Rider, with fists and with magic.From Carvahall to Gil'ead through the Hadarac Desert to the Beor Mountains, dragon, rider and Brom travelled together, their journey filled with peril, grief, discovery, survival, faith and courage. Will Eragon prove himself worthy enough to be a Dragon Rider?Paolini's fast-paced narrative and vivid descriptions made Eragon an exciting, enjoyable read filled with interesting characters and imagination."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"ONe word: Amazing!This book is very well written.

It has detail, good action and has an amazing story. Eragon is a poor farm boy. He stumbles upon a blue rock in the Spine (a mountain range that has a lot of superstitions surrounding it). He thinks it may buy him meat for the year but it buys him way more. He goes to the meat store and offers the rock to Sloan, the butcher. Sloan refuses because he doesn't want anything from the Spine. Luckily, Horst buys him the meat.Later the rock starts to crack and he discovers it is not a rock at all but an ancient dragon egg. He knows he has stumbled upon something great but it is also a problem because the dragon eats a lot of meat. He asks the storyteller, Brom, to tell him about the dragon stories while he is raising it. Brom tells the stories, but he already knows that Eragon has a dragon. Brom turns out to be able to weave magic and he teaches Eragon magic. They have many adventures and eventually they are headed towards the Varden. The Varden is a resistance against the evil king, Galbatorix. I liked it most when Eragon said,\\"Brisingr!\\" while he shot an arrow and he killed three urgals. He didn't even know what he did. What will happen to Eragon? Find out; read this book. This book is right for anyone."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I have read and reread all of the Harry Potter books and then I found this book and the cover looked interesting. So I decided to read it and see if there was anything special to Eragon. I was mad when the book was finished and I can't wait for the 2nd book in the series. And was it better than Harry Potter? I think it was and not only that I think this book can compare to the Lord of the Rings series as well. This is without a doubt the best book I have ever read in my life. I can only hope that a movie will be made about it.

Eragon was exciting all throughout, and the plot was excellent and it will keep the reader on the edge of their seats wondering what will happen next. This is filled with interesting characters and exciting situations. Though the book has some familarities with Lord of the Ring and the other fantasy books, I must say it still is good. The author has great potential to be the next Tokien, so be sure to pick up Eragon and read it!

They make their case. He is fifteen, say the one star people. They say, Give him a break. After reading this, I have my own views on the matter. First, I admit it is very good for a teen writer. However, it is not good for a published work of fiction. I would accomadate for his flaws and agree with the five star people had he not said on his site, \\"I strive for a lyrical beauty somewhere between Tolkien at his best and Seamus Heaney's translation of Beowulf.\\" Obviously, the publicity of this book has bloated his ego, because his writing is nowhere near that of the aformentioned authors. I can only hope that you will not fuel his vanity and purchase a copy of Eragon."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I saw this in the bookstore and was drawn to the cover. I got it out of the library and was very glad I didn't buy it. I find it strange how the reviews either love or hate it. Given that the author was in his teens when he wrote it, one has to give him credit. Beyond that, though, it was nothing special. The editorial reviews are correct when they find elements similar to McCaffrey and Terry Brooks; I was also reminded of the Dragon Riders in Raymond Feist's Magician, but in no way does the caliber of writing approach any of these authors. It is certainly not \\"comparable to Tolkien\\" except for similar kinds of characters which appear (elves, dwarves, \\"urgals\\").My sister thought the plot was very similar to Star Wars, and upon examination, she is absolutely correct ...The writing is sometimes disjointed, with extraneous information the reader files away thinking it may be useful - but it isn't (perhaps in the next novel?). There is some quite graphic violence in a book that seems to be marketed to younger people. The \\"ancient language\\" for the magic is rather tedious to read and not very convincing. The descriptive similies fall somewhat flat at times; one example is \\"White mist wafted up from the surface of the river, like blood steaming in winter.\\" ?I would get this one out of the library if it interests you but don't waste your money on the hardcover with the pretty dragon on it. I will probably read the next one; perhaps as the author matures he will be able to hone his writing and really make something that holds together."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Don't waste your time. As predictable and trite as most fantasy is nowadays, Eragon is the epitome of it. It has every fantasy cliche in existence and contains absolute NO original material whatsoever. It is a frankenstein of a book, with an arm from Tokien and a torso from Goodkind. All he did was tape it all together. If you've read ANY fantasy book before, you know exactly what will happen, just replace the names with other ones. Its the most unoriginal piece of crap I have ever seen. The only reason it was published was because his parents owned a publishing company and having a kid author is a great marketing angle. If anybody else had written that book, they would have been laughed into the street."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Though the book starts off slightly strong the book becomes weak eventually. I actually put it down half way through. The dragon rider idea was pretty great the first time I read it... when it was called \\"Dragonlance\\".I enjoyed the dragon's growing and coming of age. The bond between Sapphira and Eragon was attractive at first, but the book then becomes basically a journal of a LONG journey to a SHORT distance. Like a \\"and then they walked. and then they slept. and then they walked. and then they fought.\\" For a quest where everyone is supposedly looking for them, there is a remarkable lack of an antagonist after long chapter;sThis book is great for someone who is a novice writer about a subject that he adds nothing to. If you have a child who has no introduction to the realm of fantasy reading (and I don't mean Harry Potter; not that its bad, it's quite good, it's just a diffrent realm of fantasy), then sure, let them read Eragon. Otherwise, i'd recommend the Dragonlance Chronicles by Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman. The starting book is \\"Dragon's of Autumn Twilight\\". And if you want some grit to your fantasy, I recommend Icewind Dale trilogy by R.A. Salvatore. starting book is \\"The Crystal Shard\\". There's not alot of dragon's in the latter trilogy, though it actually adds a new dimension to the fantasy realm"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Eragon isn't so much an original novel as a compilation of bad fantasy cliches. The author has somehow managed to incorporate every single one of these into the space of a mere few hundred pages, from placing apostraphes in the middle of proper nouns (how exotic!!) to big firebreathing dragons, swords with MAGICAL DARK POWERS, and zombies bent on killing everything that moves. And this ugly amalgam is laudable because the author is 18? Give me a break. To make an analogy, if you took Brad Pitt's face, gave it Johnny Depp's ears, added Jackie Chan's chin, and finally appended Denzel Washington's nose, would the result be worth looking at?The only thing more depressing than this book is the fact that so many people imbibe this garbage with such voraciousness - indeed, at the time that I visit this page, Eragon is 279th on the Amazon.com sales list.

Cliches! Useless descriptions of /lamps/! An 'ancient language' that sounds like a dying furby! A main character who is meant to be talented, kind, and courageous, but is portrayed as stupid, sentimental and ridiculously talented at everything-swordfighting, reading, magic-he attempts!

I'm halfway through the story and have already lost interest. This is just my opinion and I don't mean to be harsh, but I feel that if I were to take transcripts of \\"Lord of the Rings\\" and \\"Star Wars\\" and shuffle them both together, I'd get \\"Eragon\\". I do believe that with proper schooling, this young author will have a bright career and I hope he'll consider a re-write of this novel. I'm sure that I would have enjoyed this attempt more if the characters spoke in traditional old-english OR new-modern dialect, as I found that blending the speaking styles was distracting. I also would have preferred less repetitive conversation and more action. The first 2 chapters were good, but after that became tedious. So, I think that the book is too wordy for kids under the age of 13 and not sophisticated enough for those who are older.

Many will claim that this book is a ripoff of this or that, but really most fiction is a ripoff of something else. The key is can the writer pull it off. I think in this case the writer did pull it off, and at the age of 15 did it a lot better than most adult fantasy writers have attempted. Really I think most of the negative reviews are from those who are jealous of what this writer has done at such a young age.

HOW WRONG I WAS!Paolini takes his time to explain the plot, but he ends up making it really enjoyable and inviting. I'm still working on it, but each time I've read it, I've done it by leaps and bounds of about 100 pages at a time. The chapters vary a lot in size, but they're all manageable. There's a lot of humor in these pages, but it's used in just the right amount and at the right moments. I'm really fond of the dragon conversations - it's a VERY VERY VERY neat idea - and I was surprised that Paolini often finds ways of avoiding cliches, though I really don't know how. The only complaint I have? Some of his ideas are similar to mine in the novel I've been trying to write since far before I read this book!

I really enjoy it's sense of Fantasy and Action. My favortie part has to be the part were Eragon first learns Magic, and when he meets Murtagh, who accompanies Eragon thorugh the final stages of his adventure. Also, Saphira was explained really well. I can already picture the way she looked.( Even though I think it's Saphira on the front cover.)

The sad thing is is that it's going to be made into a movie.. a movie that anyone who plays Dungeons and Dragons will see many familiar scenes in that return no credit to the game (specifically Dragonlance).On the other hand, if you don't care or don't know about D&D; and the other fantasy themed stories or games, then you'll probably enjoy the book.

One day, when hunting in the Spine, a mountain range that was feared to enter by all, he found a saphire stone. Not long after he returned to his house, the stone cracked open. It was a dragon. Once the dragon became too big, Eragon hid it. After a while, Eragon went to Brom, the storytell who told many stories about dragons to find a name for it. After many tries with the dragon, Eragon realized it was a girl and named it Saphira. A while later, while returning to his home, Eragon realized his house had been destroyed and his uncle, Garrow, had died. Together, Eragon and Saphira, left there homeland to seek out revenge for these people who destroyed his house and killed his uncle. This is how Eragon begins and how Eragon determines the direction of his fate, for the good or for the bad. That is how this excellent book, which holds most of its secrets fairly well, starts.This book is a very original book. It is brilliantly written and extremely captivating. Paolini lets you know all the characters and makes you like them or hate them, so when something happens you sympothize, hate and love what happens.

He finds a polished blue stone that attracts strange travelers. Then Eragon finds out that it isn't a stone, it is a dragon egg! The strange travelers are called the Ra'zac; they end up killing Eragons's uncle trying to find Eragon. After that, Eragon must go on a journey to find and hunt down the Ra'zac. Then Eragon finds an elf that was in a prison, but is unconscious, so Eragon must go to the varden but Murtagh ,the son of Marzan of the foresworn( riders who turned evil ) only slows Eragon down by saying that he won't go , and argues with Eragon. I recommend this to anyone who is into action and adventure.Courage, friendship, loyalty, and death are the main themes in this novel. Eragon shows courage Togo into the spine, even though few who went in ever came out, Eragon is also loyal to Brom. Eragon is Saphira, &Murtagh;'s friend. Then he shows courage to go after the Ra'zac. After Eragon finds Arya, the elf, he shows even more courage to change direction and go to the vaden. All of these themes make up a lot of the book.There are 4 main characters in this book, Eragon Brom, Saphira, and Murtagh. Eragon is the first character in the story. Saphira is the dragon that Eragon found in the Spine as a \\"polished blue stone\\". Brom is the one who trains Eragon. Murtagh is the on who saves Eagon and Brom from the Ra'zac. All these characters come together to fight against the empire.Eragon must go through the spine, Carvahall, Drasleona, and many other places. The spine is a mountain range that stretches from; Carvahall to Feinser. Carvahall is where Eragon lives before he went on the adventure of a lifetime. Drasleona holds Helgrind, \\"the gates of death\\". All of these places are inside of Alagaesia the total setting of Eragon.This book is for people who like adventure and warfare. Eragon is the main character. The novel Eragon is mostly about courage and loyalty. The setting for Eragon is in Alangesia. If you like adventure and warfare, then this is the book for you! I recommend this to anyone who is into magic, dragons, and adventure."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Christopher Paolini for being as young as he is takes you on an amazing journey with Eragon and his dragon.

But having read a decent amount of fantasy, I wasn't surprised when I saw hints of \\"Lord of the Rings,\\" the \\"Wheel of Time\\" series, and even a touch of \\"Star Wars.\\" That's the way the genre goes - you'll find it everywhere. People constantly borrow from each other.This book isn't perfect, but it's wonderfully written. The characters, while needing a bit of time to round out, are powerful and seem \\"real.\\" I love that there are both male and female characters in the story that are strong and kind - and the main male character isn't fantasizing about some chick's scantily-clad . . . upper . . . region. (Saphira would certainly never stand for that. ;))As an adult, I enjoyed this book more than most of the Harry Potter books, and I was glad that the author actually had his characters accomplish things in the book instead of wandering around calling each other wool-headed sheepherders and then kill off the big bad guy at the end in a few sentences (the way Robert Jordan often does). And as for copying Tolkien - well, who wouldn't?I'm anxiously anticipating reading Eldest, and I plan to keep this book around for my own kids someday."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"In Eragon, the first of three in the Inheritance Trilogy, by Christopher Paolini, a young, unsuspecting farm boy by the name of Eragon meets his destiny on a hunting trip. A blue stone, which appears in the Spine, a supposedly cursed mountain range, where Eragon is hunting, and little does he know it but this stone will change his life forever. After this moment Eragon is destined to be the first of a new generation of riders.Christopher Paolini does a great job at mixing the era of middle earth into his own stunning new novel that will grasp the reader's attention from the start! Creating your own world, characters, and language isn't easy, but if this young author does as good a job he does in Eragon in the rest of the trilogy his name may possibly be remembered as well as J.R.R Tolkein and J.K Rowling.Eragon is a book about family, heroes, and is a legacy waiting to unfold right before your eyes."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"so I bought the book from the discount pile in my favorite bookshop. Now I am glad I didn't pay full price for this book. First the writing is awkward, as if someone told him to add more descriptions, and he added too many. Second the book leans very much on previous tales, most apparent is Star Wars. Okay, some things are different, in this book for instance Darth Vader is the Emperor, but many things have a different name, but are the same.Then why do I give this book four stars? Because he shows he can tell stories, and I really look forward to seeing him write something not leaning so heavily on what came before. Even though Eragon is based on Luke Skywalker, he made him three dimensional, and a lot of older writers can envy him for that."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"The person who wrote the \\"Impressive for a middle-aged loser, clearly written by a middle-aged loser\\" clearly new what he was talking about. Listen up \\"master\\" maybe Paolini bypassed your review skills by a long shot.To other new readers, you would just read the first chapter of Eragon to get hooked into reading. When I read this book I thought 'Wow a 17-year-old wrote this?' The plot is wel formed and I can't get why some people said that this book is so boring, it's so great, the magic and all the suspence. It's an exellent book up to the ages 10 to an adult unless you are a sappy critic."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I found Eragon to be a very clever and creatively written book. From the first page I could tell it was written by a young author but I don't think that it really took away from the book. The story was awesome. It's only real drawback was that the type of story was very similar to other books, in fact, it's obvious that he took inspiration from other books he's read. Not that it's a big problem, it's just that there are so many coming of age stories out there. The character development was good and I cant wait to see what happens in Eldest."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This book is the greatest, I've read the other book and I can't wait for the third."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Ok So yeah I'm a book lover!

After watching the story it did that but in miniscule comparison to what i expected if you must watch the movie do it but read the book afterward because Eragon is a high detailed book of Might and Magic where good is tested and evil is looked to be overthrown.

I was a bit turned off by some of the less than unique names. He \\"borrowed\\" from Beowulf (Hrothgar) to Steven King (Gi'lead). This was the only thing that grated on me a bit.I have read many of the reviews listed here that harp on his age. It is, whether you like it or not, remarkable that such a young writer could pull off such a feat. So what if it is a bit \\"comfortable?\\" I read fantasy and science fiction novels because they are exactly that. I know going into every new book that it will be somewhat familiar. This book is no exception.Is it a great book because it does new things never before seen in the genre? No.Is it a great book simply because it was written by a teenager? No.Is it, in my opinion, a great book because it is entertaining? Yes.This is a young adult book written by one of their own. If the book lured in young readers that might not have read this or any book, I don't care how the publishers promoted it. I don't care if he used his parents' company to make it easier for him to reach those reluctant readers. He got them to read. But enough, I will step down from my soap-box.This is a good fantasy. It kept me enthralled once I got over seing familiar names in unfamiliar places (The only reason it gets a 4/5 from me). I would gladly have my daughter read this, or better yet, read it to her when she is older.Get over the outside influences that may have made you pick the book up and ask yourself if you enjoyed the story. I for one am glad I read it so late, I won't have to wait more than a month for the second book. I have great expectations from it.

Christopher Paolini seems to cover every single aspect of a traditional fantasy novel.But I love anything to do with fantasy, and I was very impressed by this book. To have such dedication for 3 straight years is very impressive. Paolini was only a year older than me when he started writing this and he has inspired me to start writing as well.I also noticed that it was a bumpy book.

Maybe it is not the best book that I have read, but I definitely enjoyed the story.Yes, I did notice that Paolini freely borrowed ideas from other fantasy series such as The Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, the Earthsea cycle, and McCaffrey's books on dragons. He borrowed the ideas! I'm okay with that. With those ideas, he created his own story. Because Paolini obviously has a love for fantasy, he is going to be influenced by what came before him. Some books may be more original than his, like the Harry Potter series in my mind. This does not mean that I cannot enjoy the story for what it is. For me, that is an enjoyable read.I hope you will read this book and form your own opinion.

Skip it!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Okay, the author is talented for his age, but that doesn't make this book a masterpiece or any better to read, for that matter. It was good but HORRIBLY unoriginal. It was an exact mixture of Jeremy Thatcher, Dragon Hatcher (he finds a dragon egg, doesn't know what it is, the dragon \\"chose\\" him to be its companion, he raised it and they were able to communicate telepathically - EXACTLY like JT, DH which I read in 6th grade); the Lord of the Rings (the species and variety thereof in this book are very similiar to Tolkien's); The Wheel of Time series (how he meets and acts with his human companions reminded me of Jordan's works) and just about any other fantasy book I've gotten my hands on. The idea of the \\"Shades,\\" is over-used, the personality and description of the \\"Urgals\\" can be found in many books but with different names, and everything was horribly cliche. It was also incredibly predictable (I would get into this more but it would be a spoiler for those who still want to read it). It's worth borrowing at the library but don't waste your money on it."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I suppose a little history first. I first picked up Eragon several years ago in a book store after hearing plenty of buzz about its young writer. After snickering through a couple of badly written chapters, clearly by an amateur, I dropped it right back on the shelf. Fast forward to the movie release, a friend told me that it wasn't THAT bad, and that I should reconsider it. I purchased the book in paperback, but still had the same reaction each time I tried to read it. Finally, I was faced with dwindling book space--to the point that I was going to have to get rid of the book unread, so I sat down and read it this weekend.First to anyone who says it isn't derivative, you simply have not been exposed to enough fantasy. If Paolini had an original idea in the book, I didn't bump into it. To a degree that's fine, as saturated as the fantasy market has become, it's almost impossible for someone to have a completely original work. That said, Paolini lifted from other authors' works in whole cloth. I would say he should be ashamed, but what young writer hasn't written something completely derivative of a favorite work? Instead, the shame should fall on his publishers, editors, and his fans who keep praising this drivel to the skies like a mature work. This book should have been left in a drawer, where Paolini would discover it years later, flip through it and be embarrassed by his naivet&eacute;.Instead, it's out in the world at large ready to pounce on unsuspecting readers. The book is bad. The dialogue is awkward, the plotting is heavy-handed, and the characters are flat. I'm one of those people that will spout tears over a good character death. Brom's death? I snorted. It was so obvious that the author might as well have written in bold, \\"I AM GOING TO KILL THIS CHARACTER IN A HUNDRED PAGES.\\" Also it's pretty clear that the kid doesn't have any real experience with death. Never mind the Mary Sues. Know why Angela is original? Check the dedication...he wrote his sister into the book. Good grief.Besides that? The pacing is okay, and by okay, I mean that I start skimming when I get bored, which was mostly near the last quater of the book. It wasn't entirely unreadable. I'll probably watch the movie to see how they adapted it, but there is no way I'm picking up anything else from this author until someone says he's grown up. Given that he's being praised for his juvenilia, somehow I don't see that happening any time soon."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Finally finished \\"the dragon book\\" as my friend keeps calling it and, looking back, I cannot believe I made it all the way through.Nothing surprising happened from start to finish, plot and character entirely predictable.Characters are uniformly Good or Evil in uniformly dull ways.Every chapter is written like a Q&A.; Eragon endlessly asking questions and getting answers. The author cannot stage a dramatic exchange of dialog.Gah."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"The one problem I have with this book is that a great number of chapters end with Eragon falling asleep. It gets too redundant. Also the fact that magic came so easy to him.He has too many skills, swordsmanship and Ranger abilities, healing, mental telepathy, and charisma.This is a readable book, but the author falls into Gary Stu territory."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Eragon is an entertaining novel, one that is clearly slated for younger readers. Adults will find pleasure in it as well, although the occasional smile will cross their faces as the author's youth and relative inexperience with narrative reveals itself. Pacing in particular is an issue. The author needs to better understand when to recount events minute by minute and when it is best to skip large portions of time in the interest of keeping the reader's attention. When a travelling band of adventurers takes a month to cross a barren desert, I really don't care to read a step-by-step account of their travels. There were times I felt almost as worn out as Eragon, and I desperately wished the author would just get on with the story.Despite this shortcoming, the story of Eragon has a few endearing qualities that one doesn't often see in a fantasy novel. One of them is the protagonist's deep preoccupation with real-world questions. Where did we come from? Why are we here? What happens when we die? If death is the end, what meaning could life possibly have? These types of concerns don't usually emanate from fantasy characters. I found it gave the novel more of a meaningful relation to its readers.Another thing I found quite endearing about the novel was the beautiful relationship the author paints between Eragon and Saphira. The two are so closely connected, and their exchanges so rich with honesty and bereft of any kind of artificiality, one can't help but be touched by the bond these two share. It is almost like reading a story of two lovers, although that is clearly not the author's intent. The mental exchanges between Saphira and Eragon are where Paolini's writing shines the most. It's hard to believe that the wisdom, intelligence, and compassion that emanate from Saphira's dialogue came from a fifteen year-old boy's head.Eragon sticks to the typical fantasy novel template. It pretty much reads like every other fantasy novel ever written. It would be just another book on just another shelf if it weren't for the very essence of innocence that the author reaches for in the character of Eragon. In the midst of his world collapsing around him, and bearing witness to darker evils every passing day, Eragon embodies an untouchable and unwavering innocence, a sense of justice uncompromised, and an unconditional compassion. His is the eye unblemished. Though plagued by self-doubt, and confused by his emerging role in the world of Alagaesia, he sees with a clarity as sharp as a diamond. It is a representation of that part of each one of us that is never, ever touched by the oustide world. That part of us that perceives as we perceived as a child, unclouded by bias, experience or influence. That place is in each one of us, and Eragon helps us to remember it. This characteristic, along with the others I mentioned above, connects the world of Eragon to the one in which we live in a way that no fantasy novel I've ever read has done before.It's almost as if this were one of those fantasy novels in which the protagonist starts out in the real, modern world, and is transported to a fantasy land where he must deal with fantastic improbabilities with his real-world mindset. Although this is not the case with the character of Eragon, it rings true in a symbolic sense. Eragon is both a part of and fundamentally separate from the world of Alagaesia. He is the center of a titanic power struggle between huge forces in the land, and yet he sees how so much in his world simply doesn't make sense. He remains, at his core, uncommitted to anything is his world besides the desire for justice and to ease the suffering of others.But I ramble. In summary, Eragon is a unique addition to the fantasy genre. Pick it up and give it a read before the upcoming movie ruins it."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This is one of the worst books i have ever read.

That way I might just spitefully encourage a young reader to step a way from Eragon. Educators breeding illiteracy one day at a time!\\" O, and by the way, stop playing his success off as the product of a well marketed gimmick. It's not, and it doesn't make you look too bright. True the kid took a lot from other authors, but that may be what makes the novel so brilliant. It's an amalgamation of all different styles, ideas, thoughts and stories. It should be celebrated, not condemned for being so. And he doesn't have a good editor? Obviously everybody from Paolini International and Knoff Publishing are idiots and you out smart them all. You should be praised at an alter. You're just so brilliant. And Paolini's an idiot too, he didn't write short story after short story and plot out his novel before he published it. Nope, you're just the only person who knows anything about writing in the world; we should all acclaim you as our master now and be done with it.\\"How can I dislike or be too critical of someone who so obviously loved some of my own favorite authors, loved them so much that they simply took over his book through I'm guessing no fault of his own.\\"Thank you master, we'll quote you on that one day as we bow to your shrine.\\"And that in a nutshell is the problem with Eragon. The story is cliched, formulaic and barely passable as are the characters and the language is simply what you would expect from a somewhat precocious teen fan of adult fantasy. If you have any experience in the field of fantasy at all, reading Eragon will feel like a visit to Las Vegas (though not so tacky)--sure you can see New York and Paris and Italy, but they are mere shadows of the real thing. So McCaffery's telepathic link between dragon and rider is here, but not the powerful emotionality of her (especially earlier) works. LeGuin's idea of one true name and one true language forming the backbone of magic is here, but not her masterful sense of order and balance and restraint, not to mention the sparse beauty of her language. And of course, the graceful, bow-carrying elves, the gruff and secretive mentor with magical powers, the withdrawn dwarves, etc. all show up in their correct place and time. As a high school English teacher, the story and characters are exactly what I would expect to see if I picked up one of my fantasy fan's personal notebooks off of their desks and began reading. Even the people and place names are far too imitative (as opposed to inspired by). To be perfectly honest, it was so much like my students' writings I had to struggle to continue past the first ten pages.\\"\\"Formulaic?\\" So now that the High School English teacher has ran out of things to complain about, he says that the kid's writing is too structured? Hmmm.....the brilliance is emerging yet again. True, the language was a bit sketchy, what did you expect, the kid to become Tolkien overnight and have eight different languages planned out in full?\\"Fan?\\" buddy, you're the fan, this kid goes far beyond. Nice one on that Los Vegas analogy, I can see maybe a fourteen year old slip to using it in a desperate situation. Might I resubmit that you have a talent for stating the obvious? I dare say that you're classroom must be as lively as mid-afternoon soap opera. We know that this kid takes a lot of style and peoples from his library's mentors. Get over it. And my allergies got really bad when I heard you say that you would read that in any of your student's notebooks. I don't think that you've ever had the pleasure of having such a well-read, well-written, intelligent, interesting young man in your career. You had a problem with the first ten pages? Maybe you should have put it down then, because I'm sure that it lost you somewhere along the way.\\"Does that mean nobody could enjoy this book? A quick look at the reviews clearly shows that many have (most of them young I'm sure). If you have read Tolkien, McCaffery, LeGuin, Jordan, Lewis, Pullman, Donaldson, etc., then I'd strongly suggest skipping Eragon. You'll not only be heavily disappointed by the weaknesses in plot, character development, and language, but you'll probably be annoyed at how often your favorite authors appear in borrowed and poorer clothing. If you have little experience in fantasy and so won't be bothered by the obviously derivative nature of this book, you'll probably enjoy it but there are far better works to begin a lifetime of fantasy reading with and even if you start with Eragon, I hope you quickly move onto them, beginning with the above list and adding for younger readers people like Lloyd Alexander, E. Nesbit, Robin McKinley, and many, many others. I'd like to see what this young author comes up with in another five-ten years, but for now he's still retelling the stories he liked himself, rather than writing down his own.\\"I've read Jordan, Lewis and some McCaffery, and I'm telling you that Eragon does not only meet the mark, but in some cases it goes beyond. After you restate your restated obvious, you then say that the authors which have been this kid's mentors are going to be in \\"poorer clothing\\". Here's the thing, THEY MAKE MONEY. AN ABSURD AMOUNT OF MONEY. If you meant that literally, then you deserve to get smacked! If you meant it figuratively (wow, that's a break) then you have just restated your restated, restated self! Then you suddenly become an educator and give kids a list of books that you read when you were a kid, completely ignorant to their generation and their likes and dislikes before you give some testimonial about how good Paolini might be in 5-10 years. Ha. Almighty knowledgeable one, we'll quote you on that one too.Here's the truth: Paolini deserves recognition, not because of his age, however because he's a young intellectual mind that has successfully pulled together an amalgamation of great works and written an astounding fantasy novel. McCaffry tips her hat to him and we should do the same. Well done new blood, well done.Mat Perrin, esq."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"First I apologize for my previous reveiw. I did not understand how the themes in this book where teaching wrong. There is no such thing in real life as \\"good magic\\" it is not posible. Nither can magic be used for good in real life. Don't get me wrong I am not talking about \\"magic tricks\\" for they are not \\"real.\\" I am saying true wichcraft and sorcery thease can NOT be used for good. Do not read this book. I am writing this becuse not many other revews would go this far to tell of what the backround theams are. Those who do not like Harry Potter do not read this book. In my opinion this book is much more about evil than good. Yes, I know it's \\"fantasy\\" but the themes of magic are much more intence than other fantasys I have read. If you don't listen to me on that listen to me when I say that this book is, with the exeption of magic taught, is not much diffrent than other fantasys. Also its not even my writen well, in opinion. Please ignore my other revew, This is not a book worth reading. Read, \\"Black\\" by Ted Dekker insted. Do not read this book, but if you do, not that I am saying to at all becuse DON'T, remember that the theames of are incorrect. This book is not an allegory and I am not saying that all the use of magic in allegorys is incorect for they sometimes are repersinting an actual event, to tell it in a difrent way.

This book I read in five days and towards the end it got so good that I had a hard time putting it down. I'd recommend it to anybody, especially dragon lovers!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"First off, I've read more than my fair share of YA and fantasy, and this book is by far the BEST. The people that are writing bad reviews on this book have no idea what their talking about, Christopher Paolini has LOTS of talent, and, he's FIFTEEN for crying out loud!I can see how people would come to the conclusion that this isn't original; it may be a little like LOTR ( Lord of the Rings) with CP's usage of elves and dwarves, but just because he uses them in his books doesn't mean that he's copying them--aside from the elves and dwarves, I see no common denominator between the two. If you want to call something un-original, feel free to look at any one of the thousands of TWILIGHT re-writes.Pro's: The book is very well writen, very discriptive without being too discriptive. Character development is amazing, you feel like you know the characters, and you love them. You feel like you're there, like you're just sitting in the backround watching everything that is going one. CP doesn't always give the happy endings, so you honestly don't know what to expect.Con's: None.Christopher Paolini has loads of talent, and ERAGON has fully earned the five stars--I literally couldn't put it down. I can't wait until he come's out with the fourth!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Well, after a couple of weeks I've decided to put Eragon down unfinished. I made to page 462 before giving up. I started reading this to see what mistakes the author made, so that I don't make them in my own writing, and second, to try and figure out why on earth something this poorly written could end up a NYT bestseller. I got a lot of answers on the first one, but am still a little shaky on the second.I give it two out of five stars - I would have given it one star, except when I thought about it, I realized that I probably would have enjoyed this book when I was 8-9 years old. That's totally fair. It would have sparked my imagination, probably expanded my vocabulary (more on that later), and prompted me to continue reading fantasy, which I loved then and love now. So two stars for that. Now the problems.First, voice. The single biggest issue here was vocabulary. I think without this problem, I might have finished the book. There's not really anything wrong with Paolini's writing, though there's nothing particularly compelling about it either. The thing is, he uses all the wrong words. Clearly the young man is very intelligent. However, at least at the time he wrote this book, he hadn't learned that the bigger word is not necessarily better - and often times, the bigger word is worse. This didn't leak into the dialogue much, but the narrative is littered with it.Second, plot. A lot has been said about this elsewhere, so I won't harp on it, but basically, if there's anything new in this story, I sure hadn't found it by page 462. This would be fine if I were 8 or 9 and not familiar with as much fiction as I am now, or if the voice was compelling enough, but as it was, it just turned into a game to guess what was going to happen next, and then it just got boring. Paolini is quoted on Wikipedia as saying that he purposefully included archetypal elements of fantasy, and that's fine, but the story still needs something to make it worth reading, and for me, this just didn't cut it."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Hmm, this is going to be a short review because there really isn't much to say and everyone else has already said it. If you want a more childish adventurous fantasy book then this is great. Its got all the archetypical plotlines, characters, magics, and creatures you could ever want. It just has a story that is fun to read, nothing more and therefore it gets no more than two stars. I can't believe at how popular this is and that it already has a movie, kinda sad. To unoriginal. . ."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Most readers have heard by now that Fifteen-year-old Christopher Paolini began writing Eragon in a notebook while sitting on the couch. His youth can be seen in his writing, his plot is at times clich&eacute;d and often formulaic. However, having said that, I enjoyed the novel. The setting Paolini creates is comprehensive, with detailed back-story, geography and laws that rule his imaginary world. (Yes, some of these laws are borrowed from other authors.) The characters of this world, in comparison to the movie are much fuller and more developed. Paolini has stated that he carefully plotted the story and I did find it formulaic but also classic.Like any author he has read and was clearly influenced by other fantasy and science fiction authors. Others have criticized Paolini for incorporating ideas from other authors into his work. I would agree that he obviously does this and, from a more mature author, I would expect more subtlety. He is open about many of the authors that have influenced him and lists some on his website.Eragon is not fantasy in the class of The Lord of the Rings or The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe but I asked myself, would I have enjoyed this book if I had known nothing about the author? My answer is yes. For me his youth only adds to the enjoyment I receive from his work. To have created a fine story while only a teenager makes me wonder what he will achieve in twenty years.As I suggested earlier, I did not find the movie enjoyable but Eragon, the book, is an excellent first novel by a fine new author. I look forward to Eldest and all his future stories.Recommendation: Read the book but skip the movie.Kyle Pratt"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I thought this book was a good debut for a 15 year old. I'm not going to write a plot summary because Amazon and several other reviewers have already provided them. I do feel that this book had a lot of ideas copied from Star Wars IV. It was very easy to see the similaries. I like the world this author created. I enjoyed the character interplay and felt that they were well developed for the start of a series. Please understand that this is a first book. I think if you read the first book of Harry Potter then you will see that you need a starting point for the characters and then you develop them more fully in the next books. I think the author did a good job of this. I feel this is a good kids' book that could be a favorite of children for a long time."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"When I first read Eragon, I loved it. I could not put it down. I carried it around with me, even if it was 800 pages, just to read it on the 10 min bus ride. I was emerged in the world Christopher Paolini made and loved it. But as I got a bit older, and I started to read other fiction, I realized that this book is very similar to a lot of other fiction books. But even if this book is a bit clich&eacute; I still enjoy and recommend it to anyone.If you are in the mood for a nice easy fantasy read, this is the book for you. If you are not sure if you like fantasy and you want to try it out on an easy book, try Eragon. But if you read every fantasy book ever written, you will notice every copied story line through out the book. So if you decide that you don't mind spending 800 pages of familiar text, this book is worth your time. I enjoyed this book and I hope that you do too."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"\\"Derivative\\" is an understatement. Almost every element of this book was taken from someplace else. The setting is Middle Earth, even down to the different varieties of orc (err...urgal). The description of magic is from Earthsea. Much of the plot is Star Wars, from the destruction of Luke's uncle's farm to the apprenticeship with Obi-wan (err....Brom), but then reverts to Middle Earth (the seige of Gondor and the killing of the Lord of the Nazgul) at the end. And of course, the dragons and dragon-riders are straight from Pern.The descriptions are unbelievably overdone, from the \\"it was a dark and stormy night\\" school of literature.But despite all these faults, it was a fun read! My kids loved it, and I picked it up on a day that I was home sick and couldn't put it down. I got to know and like the characters, and I'm looking forward to reading Book 2."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Eragon has been both overly hyped and overly critasized in many of thesereviews. I can honestly say that if you just read the book for what it is, an original work of the author, you will greatly enjoy. It obviously draws from the ideas of other authors, but if that really matters enough to you for you not to enjoy the book, I don't see how you can enjoy any books of the past few years. People often create stories based upon the ideas of other writers. The important thing here though, is that Eragon is entertaining. Paolini manages to create a fantastic and vivid world, and characters that you grow attached to, however slowly. My only real complaint with this book, and the reason I only give it four stars is the very dull first chapter and a few dry patches in between. Overall, Eragon is an interesting book, and one that will leave you waiting for more. Hopefully, those whoavoid it because of its \\"cliches\\" will take a chance and realize that there really is a good story and well-developed characters to find here.**I appologize to those wanting a summary of the book, but I only wanted to adress my opinion and the issues that have plagued these reviews since its release.

The title, even, is vertually indistinguishable from Aragorn of Lord of the Rings fame.Perhaps, if he'd spent more time thinking and ploting out the book, it would've been beter. Until that rewrite, however, avid readers of the genre should stick away for fear of disapointment."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Lessee here, there's a big blue book. *read read read* Hmm, it has star wars, lotr, and even Dragon's Blood rip-offs!!!! Saphira is like an awful version of Heart's Blood.Do not read this book!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Yup, it is pure plagiarism. There was not an original thought or concept in this book. I only read it because it was highly recommended to me.One way that I will disagree with some of the other reviewers is that I see the plot base as lifted completely from The Wheel of Time rather than Star Wars or Harry Potter. But of course The Wheel of Time is not exactly original either. Eragon has bits and pieces lifted from many great stories.There is one positive to this book and that is that Paolini has a style that is easy to read for poor readers. Now this does not make him a good writer but there is a market for this type of writing. My favorite authors include Frank Herbert, Neal Stephenson, Robert Heinlein and JRR Tolkien. But there are many young products of our failing government schools that do not have the mental guns to get through the great works of great writers.So, I would say that Eragon is a good step up from the comic book level. And for those people who do not normally read, this is an easy transition from comic books to real books. Hopefully they will be inspired by Eragon to go on to read truly great literature.From a purely economic point of view there is a great demand for books like this. The author and publisher will likely do very well and we will see other copy-cat works that attempt to dumb down stories to a level that will sell well to the masses of semi-literate in the world. This is not a criticism. It is the function of publishers to deliver product that is wanted, not to deliver literary masterpieces. The masterpieces will be left to the artists.As Mr Paolini grows in years it will be interesting to see if his style matures. Will he continue to churn out the same pulp and get fabulously wealthy in the process, or will he attempt to grow as a writer and risk offending his core readers? It will be interesting."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"What a disappointment this was!!! The story goes on and on, but doesn't go anywhere. The worst I've read.

Christopher Paolini no matter what his age has done a faboulous job creating the impressive story of Eragon. Fiction stories that can capture your imagination such as this story are truly original. I realize that this review is coming very late in the ball game, but I just had to say if you're looking for a great fiction story for you or your children, then this is a good place to start. I highly recommend all of the books in this series."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Many people attack Eragon... and perhaps, rightfully so... for its close ties to many other stories. So many plot elements, races, etc, can be intimately connected to past works of other authors.But, in my mind, the importance of a book is not from whence the ideas came, but How they are used, and how the story evolves. Sure, the elves are beautiful, long lived, and wise, like in the Tolkien books... but I didn't personally like the Tolkien books, because the hypnotic wording style kept making me daydream instead of seeing the story. (Though I do recognize Tolkien's genius). Eragon, on the other hand, I loved.Eragon is a Fun story. It is unique in its use of the ideas. Sure, Anne Mccaffery also had dragon riders... but the relationship between the dragons and riders in Eragon and the Pern series is so vastly different, they barely resemble one another.Any who read this book, who have also read and enjoyed other fantasy novels, I have this, really, to say. If you want to enjoy the book, don't actively compare it to other books it may remind you of. Simply read Eragon as is.Eragon is a beautifully crafted, unique story, and, over the course of the series, has the best character development I've ever seen. I give it 5 stars, because despite the clich&eacute;d elements, the heart of the story, the whole of the story, is unique and compelling.Eragon really does require the whole series. It's one very, very long story. Throughout the series, you see both Eragon and the author grow and mature. It is a very interesting effect, because it feels like the Soul of the book grows with the main character. The writing style improves gradually, and for me, it makes the entire story feel more real.All in all, if you are unable to judge something for its merit due to similarities it has to other stories, then Eragon is not for you. However, if you can enjoy a good story, with familiar races and premises, without condemning it for knowing where Christopher Paolini's inspirations lie, then a delightful world awaits you."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"When I stumbled across this book, I was surprised at how much I liked it. In fact I liked it so much that I did research on the author, Christopher Paolini, just to see what I could learn about him. What I discovered truly amazed me, as he was only fifteen when he started writing. I thought the movie version of Eragon was awful. It had none of the complex character dynamics that I liked so much in the book; such as the tension between Eragon and Arya. I do not recommend the movie.Story overview:---------------Fifteen-year-old Eragon, who lives with his uncle Garrow and cousin Roran on a farm, finds a polished blue stone, which appears right in front of him one day as he wanders in a wilderness called the \\"Spine\\". To his surprise, several days later a dragon hatches from it.Eragon learns that the dragon, Saphira, has chosen him to be her rider, and Eragon's uncle gets killed because of it. He travels with a man named Brom to a place called Teirm in order to find the murderous Ra'zac who did the deed. Along the way Brom trains Eragon in magic, sword fighting, and the Ancient Language.After many events, he discovers a captured elf, Arya, and frees her. They flee to the Varden, which is a group of people forming a rebellion against the tyrant Galbatorix. The Varden is invaded and Eragon finds himself fighting alongside them.My thoughts:------------I know that this story is not particularly original, in fact there are many elements of \\"Star Wars\\" and \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" used here. However, the situations and characters kept me wanting to know more. At first I didn't like Eragon, but as he grew so did I grow to like him, and I particularly liked the werecat, Solembum, who is an extremely interesting character.James D. MaxonAuthor of Traphis: A Wizard's Tale"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Now here's a book that will surely captivate your eye, heart, and aspirin bottle. The cover will be staring at you menacingly as you try to decide which book you should steal. Ah yes. The cover I do have to admit looks nice, with a blue backdrop covering the whole cover. A dragon is staring at us and the words Eragon are below all this blue in white letters. If the cover is the only thing that captivates you're eye and the only thing you like about the book,, then this is the book for you! The inside however, is an ancient curse...I first have to say something about the title. Eragon, which is such a unique title I was shocked at how original it actually is. Take Eragon, and replace the E with a D, and what do you get? Yep. Dragon! I just have to applaud our young author for thinking of something so original!The author is just a kid, and I can't help but praise this young soul for spending so much time dribbling out some piece of stolen work. I guess home schooling didn't teach him the ponderous, yet dire consequences of stealing someone's plot line. I'm not sure if there is a law to this or not, but I do know that this is just wrong. Funny yes, but also wrong. He didn't plagiarize, but come on, now. Doesn't this plot seem a little like the plot to star wars?Eragon, a young farm boy, also known as Luke Skywalker, finds a marvelous blue stone or a little white droid in a mystical mountain place, or at a droid selling area... Before he can trade it for food, or work in the similar plot, to get his family through the hard winter, also known as harvest. It hatches a beautiful sapphire-blue dragon, or in the similar plot, produces a beautiful blue hologram of a woman. when his family is killed by the marauding Ra'zac, or the sand creatures, he discovers that he is the last of the Dragon Riders, also known as Jedi knights, fated to play a decisive part in the coming war (...do I honestly have to tell you what the connection is here?) between the human but hidden Varden, or the rebels, and the diabolical Shades and their Neanderthal Urgalls, also known as the empire with their storm troopers. all pitted against each other and the evil King Galbatorix. Also known as darth Vader. Eragon and his dragon, or light saber, set out to find their role, growing in magic power. Or can be described as the force, and understanding of the complex political situation, also can be referred to as the Jedi code, as they endure perilous travels and sudden battles, dire wounds, capture and escape just like in the fourth star wars movie called a new hope.With that obviously stolen plot in mind, I started to look at this book with even more of a critical eye, not stolen I might add. The synopsis on the back of the book, which is supposed to draw you into getting the book, made me want to light it on fire then use it to invent a new fire cracker. Dull and not posing any suspense at all, the synopsis briefly explains the plot. Underneath all the fancy elegant words I could hear it crying one simple message to me. Don't read this book. The summery even seemed bored. However, I believe in giving any piece of work a chance, even stolen work. So despite my headache after reading the back of the book, I took 6 aspirin tablets and decided to give it a whorl, and take it with me into hyperspace, and let me just say I was shocked.When I say I was shocked, I mean that in a bad way. The prologue of the story opens up in Eragon's home town of Alagasia which is in fact where most of the story takes place. It's obvious that the writer wanted to create a big bang right from the beginning, because right away we are thrust into a battle where a lone girl is fleeing through dark trees to escape the bad guys. As she does, she hides an egg, or a lightsabor in the strangely similar plot... that makes my eyes bulge, and my headache subside some. A book that starts out with action surely has no where to go but up right? Well, that's what I get for assuming things, because I was dead wrong.After I was spoiled by that awesome prologue the first chapters made that whole thing seem like a tease. I don't know about you,, but I never actually had an inert object tease me before, let alone lie to me and trick me. This book did just that. After the prologue chapter one ourd out some random horrible mindless dribble that he calls sentences. It was almost as if the book was saying \\"I'm going to mess with your head! Ha ha ha. I'm going to do Jedi mind tricks on you!: I don't like it when things lie to me. I read on however, knowing that all beginning chapters of every book are a bit droll, but I soon found the book repeating what it was talking about in chapter one, on chapter 8 as if I were retarded, and it knew I was. I could of sworn as I was planning ways to make the book more interesting, like reading it upside down, or skipping pages, or reading it out of order. The dragon on the front was looking directly at me and grinning from ear to ear, knowing what it was doing to my sanity. It was almost as if chapter one could have been completely skipped and you could still understand the story. Time and time again characters explain things in later chapters that should have been explained early on in the story so more focus can be drawn to the plot. The plot is stripped away and tossed aside to make room for explanations of things, people, events, objects, and so many other things I forgot what they were. Pretty much all we learn, and need to know in the first chapter containing more than 11 pages, is that Eragon is a farm boy who hunts, and what his town is like.Things don't really start to kick off until chapter 14 or so. The beginning parts of the book are completely drawn out and don't impel the story at all, like the bonding with the dragon. It shouldn't take 6 chapters to develop a bond that we pretty much understood when it was first introduced. In my case I did anyway, but I guess this kind of thing most readers will like if they have trouble understanding the fantasy genre of literature. For me, however, this irritated me so much I almost just skipped to the back of the book and just read the last few chapters.The style of the writing is very descriptive and dull. It reminds me of some old documentary I would see on TV or something. It does however; paint a clear image in your head of what things, people, places, and trees look like. Yes, he even describes trees in great detail. I don't know about you, but that in my opinion takes talent. That is not how I like my books. While others may be thrilled by that prospect, I am not.The writing almost gave off a kind of air that he was stalling for time until he could think of something that can happen next. There is a smidgen of mystery in these pages, but getting to that part is like eating animals. Very hard to do, and you wonder why people even bother trying.It definitely has the fantasy element in there, but that takes away from itself by having so many things you have to remember. There is a glossary in the back of the book which helps out a lot. However, when I was reading the book I found myself flipping back to the glossary more than actually reading the story. There are over 13 different people, places, spells, terms, horses, blades of grass, and types of trees, and lakes to remember. when you sit down and read a book don't you want to enjoy it, Not have it feel like you just picked up a fictional history text book? Unlike the plot to star wars, this plot is not easy to follow, which is a shame because it has such a clich&eacute; outcome, and falling action that many readers will, and do like. in my many years of reading, this is the first time I ever had to look in the glossary just to try and remember who the good guys and the bad guys were.As I said the beginning is dull. You could read the prologue, and skip to chapter 16, and it would still be talking about something mentioned in chapter two. Aside from that it's also very predictable. With ease you can figure out when Eragon is supposed to get a surprise attack, or have something bad happen to him. You could even predict the ending, and get it right. At least star wars had a twist in its woven web of plot points.It's not until the very end when you will get interested in what's going on. My aspirin bottle was almost depleted as I struggled through this book, getting more frustrated and angry and even bemused as I read on, I actually wanted to read my history book. The fantasy part is really shown in this tale as I mentioned before, but it's supposed to be a story, not an encyclopedia. Towards the end of the rising action, which takes chapters to get through, I finally had my breaking point. Sure, there were many others, like having to look at Wikipedia just to see if I was not mistaking the name of Eragon's sword for a character, when I had to go back and forth and even ahead of where I was reading to figure out what they were talking about, but that was not the last breaking point I could take. When I had to look online at a map of his town just to try and figure out where some tree was, I knew the author had something against me, that his plan was to drive me eventually to insanity. He probably planned that on purpose, but hey, we will never know. I had just signed my own death letter by reading this book, and by that point I also had one other horror happen to me, I used up every aspirin tablet I had. I was doomed.When the climax came I was astonished that I had not died yet. The climax and events after it are the real page turners that other people are talking about. Usually the climax is the best part, but in other books I read I wanted to read on until I got to the climax to see what was going to happen. This book tried to get me to read in reverse order. Read the climax first, then go back and look at the falling action. He must have been bored starting the book, so he must have tried to think of some clever way to make humans read out of order, which I almost did. You could even read the ending and still get the complete story, because like history, it repeats itself. Like history, it repeats itself.Some readers may love this book, but I don't. The writing style does not appeal to me, I didn't get into the story, and when I have to look in the glossary, and online some place to remember just who in fact the bad guy is again, that kind of irks my tidy mind. This book shouldn't be set carefully aside; it should be hurled deep into hyper space, or in front of the death stars main guns. There is a sequel to the book, but I shall use my Jedi mind tricks to be sure that eldest never comes into my hands. With weak story elements, lagging story telling, and character distinction issues, this book goes on the bottom of my recommend list. There are better books out there, but if you like hearing star wars all over again in a different binding, then this book may be for you. I however, give this book a one lone Jedi knight out of 5. Let's hope when that the force grows stronger in the final book, he can go back and give this padawann some lessons, because this one doesn't even pass Jedi training. The force is not strong in this one."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":". I like sci-fi and dislike that the sci-fi part of most bookshops has been taken over by stories involving dragons. And elves. Sci-fi is about spaceships and lasers and stuff. The only goblin I want to hear about is during the love interest and that's only if its critical to the plot! So I have had to generate some rules to filter prospective reads. These are:-a) Never read a fictional book that has a map at the start that features place names ending in \\"or\\" or with names such as \\"the enchanted forest\\", \\"the mountains of doom\\" \\"the desert of almost certain death\\".b) Never read one where the protagonist has a name with a \\"Z\\" or an \\"X\\" in it, or ends \\"or\\" unless it's Trevor. Or Ivor.c) Features dialog on the first page that sounds something like \\"Prince Zandor drove his gasping steed the last furlongs up the hill to castle Gardornack. He had ridden hard for 3 days since the Battle of the Kongor Hellpots had been lost of the Death Legion of Pooglplop rode unchecked through the Kingdom of Xantac\\". Or indeed the classic theme,\\" By the 12 Gods of Zonkotax, I will be avenged!!!\\"And of course Eragon features lashings of all of the above with jam on, and little cakes around the side. The language of the book is clumsy and it indeed reads like an adolescent fantasy of some young type who really wanted to have a girl-friend and be a big hero and all of that, but he didn't get out much because he was shy and had never seen a girls boobies, so he wrote what might happened if you could order a dragon over the internet and use it to push those big bullies about at school that made fun of him being a virgin etc etc.And what happened? He took his destiny in his own hands and wrote what is still a pretty impressive book, with a complex enough plot, reasonably rounded characters and an impressive scope. Now he can probably buy a dragon, and lives in a castle with The Sugarbabes or something and has more money than I can ever dream of. Fair play to the lad.When I was 15, I could hardly finish a 2-page essay because I was too busy having girlfriends, being good at sport and bullying that little nerd down the road who kept going on about goblins and dragons and stuff.If I had a fraction of this lads stamina, my conceptual proto-novels, \\"Dave Jesus Investigates\\" would have turned into a multi-million selling franchise, with a film and everything. Think of it, The Second Coming in 1987 San-Francisco, with Our Lord walking the earth in the guise of a private investigator, \\"Dave Jesus\\", who solves cases using his otherworldly miracle power, much to the amazement of his hard-bitten side kick Stan Legions who had lost his faith after his wife and family had been killed in a tragic church collapse. I suppose I could have added a dragon or two on retrospect...Anyway. The lad has written a book, that isn't particularly original, but it is better written than many, if not most, and was readable enough for me to read the second one as well, and the missus has the last one which I will no doubt read when I have finished my grown up books. So well done Christopher, gold star and top of the class!Edit - Oh No, \\"Dave Jesus Investigates has just been optioned by Kevin Coster, oh crap!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Yes Eragon (one letter away from Dragon) is highly derivative, and yes, the main character loses family a la Star Wars, and yes the relationship (impressing, sharing thoughts, love) is close to McCaffrey's dragons of Pern. This is the writing of a teenager, who may easily mature into an excellent story teller and writer.This is just a fun read. The pace is fast, action driven and Eragon is an accidental hero. I wouldn't be surprised to learn he's related to Murtagh (Luke and Princess Leia), that Brom fought his father (Obiwan Kenobi) that he resurrects the dragonriders (Jedi knights) or that love for Eragon is tied in with Saphira's future mate (dragonriders of Pern).Just read the damn derivative thing and enjoy the ride."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Let me start out by saying that I loved Eragon! I thought it was very creative, and being a teenager I could relate to Eragon and to Christopher's writing style as well.

This is a sign of a good book though, it makes you long for the sequel! Still, I would have probably put another chapter on the end, just to wrap things up a little more. Overall, a GREAT book!

If you are a young adult looking for an introduction into the world of fantasy, this is a wonderful book to begin with. I enjoyed the fast paced story with the mystical quality of the characters; Eragon the farm boy who is more than he seems, Brom the mysterious old man who turns out to be the mentor, Saphira the blue scaled dragon and the list goes on. Paolini has written a book that is easy to follow with dialogue that is good, but sophmoric and perfect for young adults. It is quite an accomplishment that this author began this book at age 15 years old! The one problem with this story is that much of it is \\"lifted\\" from other profound and great works of fantasy fiction. I'm stating it positively and saying it's a tribute to the great authors that so many plot themes are repeated (...)

I was very excited to see Eragon in a local Barnes and Noble a few months ago. In its hardback version, the cover is very attractive, featuring a blue dragon against a rich blue background. The title is embossed in gold. I inferred from its nice design that it would be to my liking. It was obviously being taken very seriously by Knopf, a distinguished publisher. I ordered a copy immediately.Eragon was written by young Christopher Paolini. Paolini began the project when he was but fifteen, just after graduating high school. This information is prominent in a short bio of Paolini inside the back cover. I am quite impressed at his tenacity, and do feel his age is noteworthy. However, I can't help but conclude that the success of this novel has more to do with the rarity of its author than the quality of the work itself.Eragon is not written horribly, it is just poorly conceived. Despite very descriptive language at times, Paolini fails to set his novel apart from numerous other fantasies. In fact, he relies entirely too heavily on clear influence from Lord of the Rings and Star Wars. Eragon is at once Frodo Baggins and Luke Skywalker. Unfortunately, numerous plot elements and characters are borrowed from these two stories, creating a distracting mess that is anything but unique.Additionally, setting aside the regrettable dependence on the two fantasy classics, Eragon is not a solid story. Eragon himself does not adequately grow in an interesting way as a result of his new responsibility. Many other characters are hollow copies, unmotivated and blurry. The plot is clear, but not good. I wondered numerous times why the characters were taking the action they were. I read, hopeless with boredom at times, as they visited one locale after another with similar encounters. The plot seemed false and contrived at many points. In the end, I realized I wasn't really rooting for the good guys. I didn't know enough about them or who they were to care. A very common (and good) piece of advice to fiction writers is \\"show, don't tell\\". Paolini failed to show the behaviors, emotions, or motivations of his characters. He failed to show the conflict Eragon faced and why his readers should care. He failed to show much of anything. He simply told.In the book's favor, I found the concept of such intimacy and communication between a dragon and her rider interesting. Unfortunately, it wasn't explored in a way that satisfied my curiosity. Readers really don't get to know the dragon very well. After a short while, Eragon seems to take his position and abilities for granted. He becomes cruel at times, arrogant, and his motivation is unclear. We never get to see that relationship blossom into the terrific partnership that is implied with dragons and riders. I hope this will evolve more fully in the sequel.With these story weaknesses revealed, I would think Paolini's editors could have tasked him with a rewrite fixing these issues and the result might have been a very good novel. Unfortunately, that was not the case.This novel might be terrific for the younger audience, but it is will not give satisfaction for a more sophisticated critical reader."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I read over some of the negative reviews of this book and feel like those reviewers over-analyzed the book. Sure, if you're a hard core fantasy reader (I am not--though I do read some), you may find it blah. But take it for what it is--an enjoyable weekend read. Also, don't forget that the intended audience is children. After Harry Potter, maybe the expectation is that all such books should be just as much for adults as for kids.I cared about the characters, enjoyed the growing relationship between Eragon and Saphira, and had a tough time putting the book down. There is a sufficient amount of suspense (sure, some things are predictable such as the Arya's survival), but there are a lot of questions left unanswered. Some question of who can be trusted.Just read it, enjoy it and don't try to find too much in it.

At the end of the first book I felt jilted that the story had come to a pause and I can't wait to read the next book. If there were ever a book in need of a movie deal - this is it.

As one of the few people in this country who can actually read (and understand!) \\"The Federalist Papers\\", I thought this book was a good read and very well-written. I have always been an avid reader of all kinds of genre: classical works, mythology of all kinds from many cultures, fantasy, historical novels, etc. Seriously, hasn't anyone ever heard the phrase: \\"there is nothing new under the sun\\"?Truly, all fiction is an amalgam of multiple images, characters, ideas, etc. combined in new and interesting ways. Harry Potter (my personal favorite), Star Wars; yes, even LOTR all use elements and ideas that have already been done somewhere else. I seem to recall there was a ton of criticism about CS Lewis borrowing so much from his mentor, Tolkien, when *Chronicles of Narnia* first came out.I really think all the negativity is coming from people that have only been exposed to Star Wars, LOTR and Chronicles of Narnia and probably only just the movies, at that. They have obviously never bothered to study Greek Mythology or read any of the classic literature or they might at least have something intelligent to say about the Inheritance series. As it is, I'm glad that you called all the naysayers on it. Good for you!! And good for Christopher Paolini for for showing homeschoolers proud!!! Way to go!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Of course I belonged to the throngs that bought the book without reading a review. I wouldn't be a nimrod, and life wouldn't be ironic if I didn't. My first compulsion was to regret the act, but now I'm looking at it as a learning experience. You know, like a list of things of what NOT to do.Unless a book is truly horrible, I usually stick through till the end, and while I can't entirely say that this book is utter rubbish, I believe that it comes dangerously close to being so. Like many other reviewers said here, I find that the prose/plot/settings of Paolini's work was painfully similar to Star Wars: A New Hope and Tolkien's Middle Earth. Now that hit a nerve. But I was trying to be understanding and pushed my annoyance onto the backburner; because a lot of fantasy works out there are obviously going to carry fragments of some of their classic predecessors - there's even a postmodern term for it, and it's called \\"intertextuality\\".To quote one of my old college professors: \\"we don't so much \\"write\\" discourse as that we \\"are written by\\" the discourses we attempt to create: i.e, there are strongly entrenched models, tropes, conventions, etc. that govern the possibilities of how we will write.\\"So to a certain extent, as a reader (and dabbling writer), I can be forgiving of this. However, while all writers will more or less follow the footprints that greater authors before them have laid out, all I ask is that each footprint left behind be distinctive from the older markings. In other words, by all means, observe, appreciate and learn from these texts. But for heaven's sake, please make it your own. Paolini, however, doesn't see it that same way. Though I will grant him certain flashes of originality, such as the creation of that werecat creature and the Twins in the book, I don't think these characters are enough to overshadow his derivative writing. At one point I even believed that Saphira at least would be Paolini's saving grace, but he dashed my hopes there too.And as for the protagonist, Eragon, towards the end of the book I was hoping that he would be done away with and that someone else, someone more interesting, would rise up from the ashes to take his place. No luck there. 2-dimensional is not the word. I searched and searched for ways by which I could empathize with him, but I think my empathy well had dried up. And by the time that I was halfway through, his fainting spells were so much of a common occurrence that I wanted to dress him up in a pink outfit and get him cast in a Disney princess story. But wait, I don't think that even Sleeping Beauty or Snow White were in such dire need of the smelling salts. In comparison to Eragon, they'd probably have fared better too.As for Brom - I sometimes suspect that he was written in to play the convenient character. You know, the bloke that seems to know everything, be in the right place at the right time, and has the goods and resources to train the budding hero. There was obviously little effort made to garner some connection here between character and reader. Only Brom's grumpiness carried across as real. Saphira started out a promising creature, but she too seemed to become one of Eragon's many tools of convenience. And Arya? Girl, you have my sympathies. It's clear that Eragon/Paolini has got you perched on his mantle now; all poised and pretty. Oh, and love-interest-y too. The poor thing. The descriptions of her all centered around grace, beauty, and er...beauty again. I wouldn't mind so much if he didn't overdo it. She has slanted brows, cat-shaped eyes, is fair-of-face, exotic, and when she speaks, it appears that her words lie on the edge of a song. So you mean she's gonna break out into a song now? Kinda like the stuff they do on broadway or on London's West End. Yeah, that must be it. This must be some kind of musical-parody piece.Well, to save myself - and you poor readers - from my further rants, I'll stop here. I did want to expand on his writing a la thesaurus (that's obviously become his crutch now - and some kind of peculiar instrument to demonstrate his superiority with words), but I won't. I'll just say that oftentimes, simple really does work. And grandeur can be quite off-putting.I won't quite say that you should avoid this book at all costs, but if you're planning on buying it with your hard-earned money, I really hope you don't do that. If you can borrow it, it's a good demonstration of bad. Of what to avoid when you're constructing your own works."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Were it not for the assurances by my wife that \\"it does get better,\\" I never would have made it past page 50 of this book. The prose is hackneyed and tiresome. Paolini seems unaware that phrases like \\"for what seemed like hours\\" are both cliched and unhelpful for communicating anything to the reader. At one point a character speaks \\"in a language known only to him,\\" which probably sounds ominous to a middle-schooler, but only made me laugh. His parents must be kicking themselves for paying for those lessons. Do we find out later in the book why no one else speaks this language? Of course not, because whereas a master like Tolkien could footnote his footnotes with every last detail of the events and individuals surrounding his narrative so that the reader gets a sense that he is viewing one small aspect of a great tapestry, Paolini is pretty clearly just throwing stuff together that sounds cool.That's not to say that there is no context for the action outside the narrative. In fact, I feel right at home in the world of Analgesia or whatever it's called, because frankly I've been there before. The ingredients for Eragon are simple: Start with the quasi-medieval world of Middle Earth, populated with the standard denizens of humans, elves, dwarves and orcs -- I mean, \\"urgals\\". Add the Dragonriders from Anne McCaffrey's Pern series, complete with telepathic link between dragon and rider. All we need now is a story. Something simple and mythical, that a young boy could relate to. How about Star Wars? Yeah, we'll have a simple farmboy on the verge of manhood, living on the outskirts of a great empire, who was raised by his uncle because his parents -- who seem to have been involved in something a little more exotic than farming -- are both dead. This boy seems to be destined for something greater than the simple life of a farmer, a fact which is confirmed when he happens to come upon a mysterious item that narrowly avoided falling into the hands of the imperial minions. But who will guide the boy to his destiny? Hmm... How about a wise old man living nearby who turns out to be more than he seems? In fact, maybe he's the last remnant of an order of warriors sworn to defend the old regime. Perfect!Around page 300 the author finally breaks free from George Lucas' Jedi death grip and starts to tell a semi-interesting story. Paolini had the good sense to borrow the elements of his climax equally from Tolkien, Star Wars and the last of the Matrix movies, so that while originality remains beyond him, at least the narrative no longer felt like it was going to collapse from the weight of its own redundancy. Eragon remained utterly predictable throughout, of course. About 5 pages into meeting a particular character I turned to my 12 year old nephew (Everybody's 12 year old nephew has read Eragon) and said, \\"_____ is Eragon's brother, isn't he?\\" My nephew, who has read the sequel as well (in which this \\"secret\\" is evidently revealed), replied, \\"Yeah.\\" Shocker!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I just finished this book (albiet the hardcover- but no big difference.)The author hits on many unique ideas in his story about humans, dragons, elves and dwarves vs. Evil but it's easy to see a homage to Tolkien, McCaffrey and other \\"titans\\" of this genre.The plot is light and easy to follow, although you can tell he was a teenager when writing this novel. It belabors details ad-nauseam, such as what the characters did,ate,slept,walked almost every day of their journies. I understand he was trying to show character growth, maturation and move the plot along but at times it was tedious.His dialoges are also a bit over the top as well. Young writers, I think, try to be think BIG about how adults and people of power speak and it doesn't convey realism. I wish Mr. Paolini had kept it simple and not have his characters give these verbose monologues from time to time.The story is intriuging, and I will read Eldest as well.

Whatever - for me, this book fired my imagination and gave me hours of pleasure."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"...there are several things that are incredibly irking to me when I read Paolini's work. A) the plots of Eragon and Eldest are predictable and overused, B) his characters are stuffy and suspiciously resemble Mary Sues (Gary Stu?), C) most of his ideas are not new, and D) this book was spotlighted merely because he was relatively young. The most irritating are the last two points, so I'll elaborate on those.There have been multiple reviews by both amateur and professional reviewers alike that have expanded upon Eragon's remarkable tendency to show parallels with large-name fantasy books (e.g. LeGuin, Tolkien, Star Wars, etc), so I really won't elaborate too much.Admittedly, the world of fantasy fiction *is* going to have cliched ideas. For example, sword and sorcery novels are going to have some recurring themes shared between most of them. The key to making this okay, in my opinion, is that this theme or idea is recycled between each book -- reused but remade with the author's own variation.It seems to me that Paolini sifted through the trash cans of the best-known fantasy authors, uncrumpled their ideas, and used it straight from the wastebin. Following this analogy, he has made a collage of the different ideas from these authors in his book. Needless to say, it was not a fresh read nor creative and new.Because Paolini was 15 when he began Eragon and 17 when it was published, most critics have responded positively to this work. If there had been no mention of his age, the book's popularity amongst reviewers would probably have been drastically different: most adults are amazed that a teen has the attention span to write a novel, let alone a full trilogy. (Then again, as I'm still not yet able to drink legally, I can't be sure.)There *are* kids out there who can write well and have dedicated themselves fully to literary arts. My friend's younger sister has written a full-length novel, which she started when she was 11 and finished at 14. Several of my friends have written works that are incredibly innovative and wonderfully written -- maybe not with the life's experiences an adult could put in, but certainly with a fresh voice that is, in my opinion, good enough of a replacement and without a doubt better than Eragon's.I have to say, Paolini was lucky in his popularity because he was at the right place in the right moment to get a major publishing company interested in his work. If other teenagers got this same chance, I think the general population would be impressed with what kids can churn out -- things that are fresh, creative, and a plain good read.If you like original novels with innovative ideas, skip this book. If you're looking for something to waste your time away with, this is probably amusing enough to read."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Much has been made of Eragon's derivative and cliched plot, and that is certainly in order. However, I think more need be said about the quality of Paolini's prose. The most gentle way I can think of saying it is that his writing is respectable for a seventeen-year-old, but in all honesty, it doesn't even qualify as impressive. The characters' dialogue is forced and unbelievable, and Paolini unconsciously slides between 'high' language (think Tolkien minus talent) and seventeen-year-old street jargon. I wish I could provide you with an example, but I am fortunate enough not to own the book. However, simply open your copy to any page, and I'm sure you'll see illustrated exactly what I'm talking about.This is simply a book not worth reading. There is nothing about it that I can commend to you. Neither the plot nor style offer anything of value to the reader. Though perhaps now we can better appreciate the decades of thought and study that went into Tolkien's masterpiece, and give more honor where it's truly due."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"If you've read any fantasy at all, this book will put you to sleep. Imagine all the big stories in the genre combined into one book without a bit of the craft or individual voice that sets a good, if average, fantasy novel apart."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I am a 65 yr old grandmother and I loved this book. It was given to me by my grandson after his entire family had read it and I really don't understand the bad reviews. Before taking it, I read the first few pages to see if I was going to like the story and had difficulty putting it down.Eragon was just a poor farm boy until he found a strange gem in the forest. The gem turned out to be a dragon egg that had been waiting for the right person to find it. As soon as the dragon hatched, Eragon life was changed forever. He becomes a Dragon Rider.His adventures take him from his home to the ocean, across the desert and into the mountains. He meets friends, enemies and teachers in the forms of Humans, Elves, Dwarfs, Witches, Kulls, Urgals and Shades. He learns how to fight and make magic and we learn the toll it takes on him. We also find out that Riders can \\"talk\\" to their Dragons and we learn what dragons are capable of through the mind of his dragon Saphira. I found it interesting that dragons grow at an amazing speed but can only breathe fire after it is 6 months old.I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves to escape into a world complete different than the one we live in. I find it amazing that this story was written by a boy in his teens and I am looking forward to his next book which is now being read by my grandson and his family. I am tempted to buy it so I don't have to wait.To the people who insinuated that only children would be interested in this book and only people who haven't read Lord of the Rings and seen Star Wars, we've read and seen them all.Coal Creek Gramma"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Quickly reviewed: the story is derivative, the characters are under-developed and the dialogue is wooden.

For instance, his dragon. She keeps almost changing shape! She's supposed to be so huge and strong but can't carry three people. She flies way up in the air one day, but the next day she can't breathe that high. It makes no sense.

The thing that bothers me so much is Paolini's writing. I hate the switches between 'modern speech' and 'ancient/mythic speech'. It's unbearable! First, Eragon starts off by speaking like a 20th century boy with all the short forms and all that. Then, Brom tries his best to speak archaic and wise. Paolini just can't pull it off properly!There's just one simple rule. The speech is heavily affected by what year/era the book is set in. These kinds of mythic/old books can't have characters speaking like us right now right? I mean they were actually speaking middle/old english at that time! (if im not wrong) (.....)It's really painful to see Paolini desperately trying to put the proper speech sentences into the characters. His teenage years are really affecting the book, that's alright, however his trying to involve them in a terribly disastrous way, and furthermore, the editing is a total flop.Well.. that's all i guess."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"(...)

They, with Brom the storyteller, travel around Alagaesia in order to bring justice and freedom. I personally liked it better than Harry Potter, Artemis Fowl, or any other book I have ever read.

How disappointed was I. This is, without an ounce of doubt, the most poorly written book I have ever regrettably paid money for. Shoddy characters, a splotchy story, and an over all plot that seems to pull from other fantasy writers that are much, much better than he is. Honestly, I cannot believe how many mistakes he made while writing his story. I just wanted to take a red pen and scribble out whole pieces of useless details.If you want to read an adolescent fantasy novel, go read The Golden Compass, or a Wrinkle in Time.

When you start this book MAKE ABSOLUTELY SURE you have a lot of spare time on your hands. You won't put this one down until you finish it! I read it in 24 hours only stopping to eat. Luckily, I was on vacation so I had the time.The story opens with Eragon, a seemingly ordinary farm boy from a small northern village in Algaesia (please pardon any mangling of place/person names) who finds a very extraordinary \\"stone\\" while hunting. The stone is, of course, a dragon's egg and from it hatches the beautiful Saphira, a blue dragon of charming, if enigmatic, personality. Her appearance draws the unwanted notice of the insane tyrant Galbatorix who has been fanatically hunting for Saphira's egg for years. His evil minions slaughter Eragon's uncle and destroy his home. Vowing vengance, Eragon and Saphira set off under the guidance of the wise Brom, a storyteller who is much, much more, to discover their great destiny.I'm not going to say any more about the plot, go read the book!If you like this book, I also highly recommend the Harry Potter books (of course), but more than that, anything in the Kairos line of Madeline L'Engle novels (A Wrinkle in Time is the first one), any of the Pern novels (start with Dragonriders of Pern), The Dark is Rising Cycle by Susan Cooper, anything by Robin McKinley but especially The Blue Sword and The Hero and The Crown, Mary Stewart's Crystal Cave series (I can't stress these enough!!!!!), Marion Zimmer Bradley's Mists of Avalon (Stewart's and Bradley's books are for mature readers, but this does not necessarily mean you can't be a young mature reader) and anything at all by Robert Heinlein.Mr. Paolini, if you peruse these reviews I hope you see this. I LOVE this story! I can't wait until next year for Eldest! I'm serious, I really won't be able to wait. I haven't fallen headlong into a story so completely since M.Z. Bradley's Mists of Avalon and this beats that novel so far out of the water you've vaporized the lake! I am an obsessive compulsive reader (I will read the backs of cleaner bottles if pressed!) and this is one of the top 5 books I've ever read!

Uh-huh (although the backlash is similarly excessive).But is it BAD?.........no.It's clearly a Young Adult novel, which makes it hard for a 20something like me to look at objectively (I first read it in between chapters of Knife of Dreams). This could be like a primer for fantasy. So, if you're a parent whose child is between 10 and 14, and they've already read better stuff (Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, Chronicles of Narnia, Lloyd Alexander's Prydain series, Susan Cooper's The Dark Is Rising, Robin McKinley, Christopher Rowley's Bazil Broketail series) but you don't think they're quite ready for Feist or Jordan or McCaffrey, sure, get them this.

Yes, some of the storyline seemed familiar at times but no more so than you might see in a hundred different movies (via the ever popular \\"boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl\\" scenario). If you like fantasy and adventure books it's definitely worth reading; it's also an AR book and seems to be well liked by the 5th/6th grade heavy readers (which is why I checked it out of our school library to read in the first place).I decided to purchase the kindle version to reread before moving on to the second book (it was my first Kindle download, and I had it in a nanosecond - technology rocks! :o)"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Eragon is about a teenage farm boy and the drastic changes in his life when he finds a mysterious blue \`rock'. The egg hatches and with it comes a great deal of responsibility and hardship. Eragon and his dragon Saphira, travel with various companions around Alagaesia as he discovers what it truly means to be a dragon rider.Eragon is a very enjoyable read. The story was lacking in depth and creativity, but it stole my attention early on in the book. The land of Alagaesia really does come alive; each town was interesting and had unique personality. The characters are interesting, but they, like the story, were also lacking depth and unique personalities.The story has a lot going on, which is at times good, but doesn't give you much time to really enjoy what was happening. Eragon and his companions are always charging forward with the next task to be completed. The story keeps you interested, but I think some of the beauty of the art of writing was lost in the process. I would have liked more time to get to know the characters, and less jumping from task to task.This may not have been the best-written book in the world, but I think it was done very well, having been written by a fifteen year-old boy. Most of the problems with the book I didn't notice until I looked back, because while I was reading I was completely engulfed in the story.I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a fun read. If you are looking for something intellectually stimulating, you may want to look elsewhere. Otherwise, this book is a good fantasy."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This whole book is nothing but a rip off of some of the best fantasy writers out there.

I admit that I've never seen the Star Wars films nor read the LOTR trilogy (only saw the movies) so I can't call out the similarities of this book to the other works. However, I am writing to warn other potential readers to beware of the flat characters, the thin storyline, and an extremely dry sequel (Eldest). After finishing this book, I though \\"ok, its a little like lord of the rings with the elves, and dwarves but whatever.\\" What nags me the most is the unlikable and cliche main character. The farm boy who becomes super strong to save the world from evil. To me, its just stupid that the boy can become the savior of the land through a few weeks of hurried training by a wise \\"story teller.\\" I feel like I would've like the book more if the author made the characters more realistic (Eragon struggling with his new role as savior and his struggle with learning magic, Elf-lady not so impossibly beautiful, and the rest of the characters worship the farmboy a little less).As for the second book, I couldn't finish it. It was boring, especially with the introduction of Eragon's cousin Roran.This could've been a good story, because it started out interesting. I would've liked the farmboy saving the world if only they would make the farmboy more human.I would only recommend this book to young adult readers because it is a simple read and kids should always be reading.Books > movies!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"To put it simply, Eragon is a great book.

Yes, author Paolini uses all of the beloved elements of fantasy here, but this is no mere Tolkien or McCaffrey or Brooks pastiche. As its most essential, ERAGON is a story about power. Those who have it; those who want it; those who feel entitled to take it; and sadly, those who abuse it. How startlingly amazing that at fifteen, this writer was able to see, let alone describe in elegant and poignant prose, so clearly this concept that so fascinates and drives humanity! The business and self-help sections of our libraries and bookstores are filled with the literature of power; interested readers should also check out the young adult fiction section as well. Readers who enjoy Paolini would also likely devour Anne McCaffrey, Tamora Pierce, Patricia McKillip, and of course, Brooks and Tolkien."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I personally loved Eragon.

It's quite a notch above other books I've seen, and it's on a par with Anne McCaffrey's Dragonriders of Pern series, which is my fave by far, next to Eragon.Why people put this book down is beyond me; maybe they don't appreciate how good this book is.

I'm sorry but there were hardly any girls to relate to other than Angela--who I thought kicked major but, hillarious and mysteriously cool-- and Arya who is undoubtedly going to be further developed in Eldest. Arya had like five pages worth of lines in the whole book.

Who hadn't know that Eragon will go for a long and lifechanging journey, he will save the elf and fall in love into her slowly, Brom is well-known in the far lands, Murtagh is the son of a great evil Rider, etc.Maybe if Paolini would create some own thing, he could be good writer...Now he remains fine fan-fiction writer, they use to write copies."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"One thing to bear in mind when reading Eragon is Paolini's age. While reading the novel I was struck, several times (as if a be-helmeted, Tolkeinesque dwarf were standing behind me hitting me with a hammer) by the books naivety. Its all very- erm- Tolkeinesque. All the familiar sub-Tolkien set pieces were there: dragons, dwarves living under a mountain, elves. But try as I might, I just couldn't resist his vision, and was swept away by the momentum of his story. I dislike the (now very common) plundering of Tolkien and the borrowing from his array of creatures and characters, but here I felt that it was a stunning achievement for such a young writer(he was only 15 when he started to write the book) and the relationship between Eragon and his dragon Saphira (an unfortunate name- sounds a bit like a car 'the all-new Ford Saphira') was moving and well thought-out, despite the obvious similarity to Anne McCaffery's Dragonriders of Pern series. All in all I enjoyed the novel, and its lack of originality isn't a crime (I mean, look at JK Rowling: now THERES a woman who knows how to borrow from other books. If it WERE a crime, then she'd be in prison by now) Definitely worth a look."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"EragonBy: Christopher Paolini\\"A wisp of smoke curled in the air, carrying a burnt smell.

When he realizes that this stone has lead him into the fantasy world, there is no turning back.I enjoyed this book so much because magic is such a great theme.

I think the reviewers on Amazon who are giving is brutal reviews with only one star are a little reactionary, but just the same this book isn't that good.It's certainly not bad. Yes it's derivative, but it's source material (Lord of the Rings, Anne MacAffrey, Star Wars) also mined scores of earlier works. I almost expect this from fantasy as a genre - is Harry Potter terribly original? No. But those books are well written.That's the rub, I think this people were hoping this book (and by extension the proposed trilogy) could be the new Harry Potter. To any HP fan who is thinking of reading this book for a similar experience, I'd recommend against it.This book bears much more resemblance to the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Where those books packed loads of information into long volumes, Eragon draws out a rambling plot over 500 pages, with excerpts about what the lead character ate for lunch, and how the chandaliers in a great hall look. I suppose it's rich imagery, but it gets a bit tedious at times - especially in the middle stretch.It's not a terrible book by any means, and certainly if you consider the age of the author when he wrote it, it's somewhat impressive. Personally, I don't think that should matter. Good books should be published based on their merits alone. Obviously it doesn't always work that way, would this book have been published at all if his parents weren't in the industry? Who can say?In the end - enough people have read and loved this book for some reason that my oppinion won't change much.When I closed the cover, I found myself curious about the continuation of the story, but dreading the idea of having to slog through another book like Erigon."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"There were some parts of the book that were done pretty well and some characters that I liked, like Saphira and the Shade. The problem I had with it was what has really bothered a lot of other readers - how it borrows very heavily from so many other fantasy classics that it doesn't really hold up well on its own. Other reviewers have gone into detail about this, and I won't repeat the ways this story ties into other true classics of fantasy like Lord of the Rings.It is still impressive that it was written by a teenager, but I cannot just say it's a great book for that reason. And I agree with other reviewers that point to Christopher Paolini's high praise of his own style and feel that it is not warranted. There are a lot of other books out there that are in the \\"Fantasy/Sci-Fi\\" section of Barnes and Noble that are just as good as this book, but they tanked because they didn't have the marketing angle of having been written by a first-time author who was only a teen.I think that even compared to other pulp fantasy like the original Dragonlance Chronicles and Legends, this just is too much of a retread to really take too seriously. I can't even begin to compare to Lord of the Rings, which is what Paolini seems to think himself. Like another reviewer said, impressive for a 17 year old but clearly written by a 17 year old."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I got this book for Christmas last year.

It starts off in your conventional fantasy setting, village type place, with a not to wealthy farm boy. The boy finds an egg, which is not just a normal egg, but it, of course has a Dragon in it. The boy and the Dragon, Eragon devolop a relationship, and this begins the story. Some parts of the book I found a little incipid and monotonous, with some parts of the adventure across the country.I give this book 4 stars because I was so into for while reading it. The book lost the star with, as I said, the somewhat boring stretching out of the trip across the country; and also for the unoriginality of the plot.If you're looking to get into fantasy, this book is essential, it will give you a good look at what fantasy books are all about."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"this book is realy awesome!

I can't wait untill the second book, Elder, comes out."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"First off, I would like to say the Christopher Paolini is a very talented author, don't get me wrong. Eragon is none the less an exciting story that is captivating and very well crafted. The descriptions are vivid and real, but that also is a problem. In the story there would be a long description or a long conversation, and only 1 or 2 pages of action. The battle scenes were built up with brilliant suspense, but turned out to be anti-climatic. Anyone who has seen/read LORD OF THE RINGS will catch the influence. Overall, it is a good read, yet not anything spectacular."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I got the book before it came out in stores online, and LOVED it!!!! It has a lot of interesting story plots and really challenges you to continue reading the book. If you like the Harry Potter series, you will find interesting story plots and character developments in the book. This is defintitely a book to read. Recommended for people 11+ because of the challenging nature of the book. Enjoy!!!!!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This was a fine book for some light reading. Obviously I noticed the similarities between the book and other fantasy novels, but this shouldn't bother a true fantasy reader. After all, dwarves, elves, men, orcs/goblins/urgals, etc. are usually the same in every single fantasy book (unless it's Terry Pratchett--books you shouldn't read unless you have a sense of humor).So, even though countless other people ... complained about it being \\"copycat,\\" I would like to remind possible readers (and those who have read the book) that Mr. Paolini is simply remaining true to unspoken fantasy norms, which is what pretty much all fantasy authors do.If you'd like to read a good book that doesn't require labored reading, try Eragon."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I just finished reading this book and it has to be, hands-down the best book I have EVER read. Never has any book made me turn down TV or Video Games or some type of electronic to read, but this book proved different. I was hooked from the first chapter to the last. This book made me laugh, sit at the edge of my seat, feel sad, and everything else in between. Eragon combines all of these together into one beautiful book. When I finished this book, I just looked outside and had to take a few minutes to let it all soak in because of the power this book had. This is well-written and is a must have for anyone who likes Fantasy Books. I have given my copy of this book to my sister, reccomended it to my friends, and telling everyone I know to buy this book!

I can't believe the man who wrote it is only 18."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"YES THIS BOOK IS BETTER THAN HARRY POTTER!

As it progressed, I found myself checking his map and seeing exactly where his characters where and where they were going and I was hooked. Although I could tell a teenager, albeit a talented one, wrote this book, I thought Paolini's writing and plot got more polished the more I got into it. I'll be reading the next one for sure, and I'm not even a kid, just a middle aged housewife. I am sure any young reader would love this story!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This is not an adult fantasy. Don't expect one and you might enjoy it.

I fell in love with the movie, but I never expected anything like this. After reading the book I disliked the movie, but they do have one thing in common. Both the movie and the books have charm.Everyone knows what the Eragon story is. I think I'll leave it to the other reviewers to explain it. Meanwhile, back in review land, the story was unoriginal. I know. It draws heavily on Star Wars and Lord of the Rings. However, many people can forget these details because the book is entertaining and easy to fall in love with.Why do we fall in love with the book. Because this story is the adventure every kid wishes they could lead. This is a book about a kid riding a dragon. What sounds cooler than that? The characters were also lovable. Eragon is great because he strives to do the right thing, even if it means going against his better judgement. He'd the type of character everybody wishes to be. Saphira is a kindly dragon who seems easy to get along with. However (downside speaking) she seems too rapped up in wisdom and would rather follow logic than her own moral code. However (upside speaking) she is friendly with a smug and sarcastic sense of humor.The world of Alagesia is also a nice hospitable and enchanting world. Since we don't know anything about it we strive to know as much about it. The world in this fantasy book is magical and open for adventure. If you were a dragon rider, this is the kind of place you'd want to go looking around for.The book was seriously charming. I was able to read it the first time. However, once I came to terms with reality, this book became boring. It does draw heavily from the Star Wars movies. Finally, you realize how slow pace the book really is once you read it the second time. Half the book passes by without any serious plot twists. There were a lot of vocabulary words that were hard to sit through. Each character, strangely, can have a conversation with himself. The story, even though it's charming, isn't good the second time you sit down to read it."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I'm very happy I've finally read Eragon! It's been a book that I've been curious to read for a long time. Because of it's comparisons with Tolkien's Lord of the Rings (which I very much love!) I've wondered if Eragon would be another great fantasy epic or a terrible rip-off. I'm not entirely sure that it is either. But I did enjoy the book, and would recommend it to others!I've wavered between giving this three or four stars. I would like to give it three and half, but as I can't, I'll go with three for now. I feel it's a good, solid, well thought out story. I felt that I trusted Paolini to have thought through all of the choices a character had available, and that he'd made sure the characters were making the correct choices for them at that moment in time (and that if not, that were the point).I thought there was good character arc and good build to the story. I liked the characters a lot, but I'm not sure I totally loved them or felt completely invested. It took me a while to understand Saphira's personality, but once I did I liked her a lot, and the fact that she reminded me greatly of cats was a huge plus! It is a fantasy epic like LOTR, but it focuses of fewer characters, which I think hindered the story (for me) a little, because I didn't feel a huge connection with the characters right from the beginning. But, as I said, I did like them all, and was curious for the outcomes and hopeful that the end would be happy.All in all it was an enjoyable and interesting read, and Paolini raises some good, interesting moral questions. And while a few times I felt certain parts were a bit lengthy, and sometimes a bit confusing, overall the writing style fit the story very well, and was pretty clear.Regarding the \\"rip-off-ness\\" of the book:Having dabbled in writing and other creative works myself I find that I am very defensive for both Paolini and Tolkien. While I feel that plagiarism is a horrible injustice, I also feel that accusing someone of it where it has not occurred is similarly sad. Therefore, I wanted to be very fair in my analysis (which is, obviously, simply that - my analysis form reading the book without any other insights). So, here are my thoughts on the matter.I don't think it can be denied that Paolini's races in Eragon are derived from Tolkien's races. Paolini's descriptions of elves and dwarves are incredibly similar to Tolkien's - even the Urgals in Eragon are reminiscent of Urk-Hei (sp?). Whether these similarities are due to \\"thievery\\" or simply from \\"inspiration\\" and the understanding of elves and dwarves that Paolini grew up with, I, of course, cannot say. But I would like to think it the latter.Also, while there are other LOTR similarities in regard to setting, style, and arc, I don't think one can say that these were stolen, because such similarities will occur when dealing with good and evil, an ancient era, and fantasy elements.Aside from these things, I cannot recall much else that was blatantly related to LOTR. The character of Eragon appears original, as does his journey, and the dragon as a character and plot point appears unique as well. Of course, there is the wise-old sage and teacher, but this occurs time and time again anyway.(One of my favorite parts, actually, is the acknowledgements section of the newer edition of the book.)So, I did enjoy the book very much, and am looking forward to reading the next. (I enjoyed the book much better than the movie, if that helps.) And yes, I would recommend Eragon to fans of the Epic Fantasy."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"My younger sister bought me this book over a year ago, and I just now got around to reading it. I actually watched the movie first. I must say that the book is MUCH better than the movie. I was so pleasantly surprised. I recommend this book to anyone you loves stories about dragons!

This terrific story of a young farm boy, whose life gets turned upside down, is suitable for all ages. Even if you would never even think of picking up any book of the fiction class. As they say, \\"Don't hate 'till you try it.\\"This story takes place in a sort of mid evil times era yet is very relatable to this time period. The theme is man deciding his own destiny. Eragon is 15 and has no idea that his life will change when he finds a misterious blue stone while hunting to get meat for the winter. Little does he know that this stone just so happens to be a dragon egg. Now, not only does he have to take care of a pet dragon, but now, he has to worry about the evil ruler of the land, King Galbatorix. When the king comes after Eragon though, Eragon must run away from his once simple life and make his way to the resistence, the Varden. He cannot do this on his own though and seeks the help of an old story teller, Brom, with a powerful secret. The race of the dragon riders is at stake and now the fate of Alagaesia lies in his hands. Only Eragon can decide his fate with the help of his dragon, Saphira. Not only does Eragon become a man throughout his quest but also makes many friends along the way. But, are they the right kind?"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I'm not a fantasy reader by any stretch of the imagination; I tend to read mostly nineteenth century British literature. I thought that it would be fun to try something totally different and I'm so glad that I did! This book is not action packed, like some of the other reviewers wrote, but I found that to be a relief. You can actually spend time with the characters and watch as the relationships Eragon develops with the many people he meets transform him into a more mature dragon rider who is better able to meet the challenges ahead of him in the rest of the series. It was a great introduction into the world of fantasy and I look forward to reading the rest of the series!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Although I am only halfway through the book, I am enjoying it, especially given how young Paolini was when he wrote it.The story evokes images of other books and series well-known and beloved for their depictions of dragons and fantasy: Lord of the Rings, Pern, and even the epics of Greece and Rome.Eragon follows the story of the tile character, a teenaged boy who happens to be the first Dragon Rider in a century. Eragon, his dragon Saphira, and his mentor Brom travel through the empire, searching first for revenge for Eragon's family, then for the Varden, freedom fighters against the king Galbatorix, the mad and corrupt Rider who started the massacre of his fellow riders a century earlier.Those who are looking for the epic writing, sophistication, and maturity of the aforementioned classics: be warned. Paolini was only fifteen when he wrote Eragon, and though the story is good is surprisingly well-written for a fifteen-year-old, it still does show Paolini's age (or lack thereof). The writing does improve as the book goes on, and I have great hopes that Paolini's writing abilities will grow in leaps and bounds as he grows older and writes more."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"\\"All he wanted to do was tell someone about the events of the past few months.

He is planning to track down his uncle's killers.In the book, the main charecter Eragon finds a mysterious blue stone. What makes this stone odd is it is smooth and polished. The next night the egg cracks and breaks open revealing a small blue dragon. Eragon reaches forward and touches the dragon and on his hand is a silver symbol called the gedwey ignasia which symbolizes that Eragon has become a dragon rider. His farm gets destroyed and his uncle murdered by two strange creatures called the Razac. Eragon must travel across the country of Alagaesia with an old story teller named Brom to find the Razac and avenge his uncle.Eragon was one of the best books that I have ever read.

Eragon is only 15 and he has been thrown into something bigger than himself. He makes this story flow. Without him or with someone else, this story wouldn't be so great.

And from that day, he has ruled us.\\" Eragon, a simple, smart, farm boy finds a strange, polished, blue stone in the mystical woods known as the Spine. Later he finds out it's hollow. What is it?In the book Eragon by Christopher Paolini, the stone then cracks and a little blue dragon hatchling comes stumbling out. Eragon is now a master of a dragon. Eragon names it Saphira.

In his journey, he goes through Carvahall, Daret, Gil'ead, the Hadarac Desert, and then to the Beor Mountains. From there, he has a battle alongside the resistance.This book is stunning, extraordinary, and just the book for readers that love medieval sorcery and dragons. I would rate this book a 5 out of 5 because it is just so fluent in words and scenes. One example is on Eragon's farm, the book doesn't just have him have the egg immediately.

Eragon is taught magic by an elderly man who later dies, just as Gandalf from LOTR does. The magical parts of the book reminded me of the Harry Potter series by J K Rowling.Even not looking at the plagerisim of at least two famous books, Eragon was horrible. The writing was very poor, even for a 17 year old.Many people love Paolini because he has writen such a masterpiece at 17. Some people have gone so far as to proclaim him a genius.

The \\"maybe it can happen to me\\" effect gets pumped to full volume so that hero-oriented teenagers can hope that someday their own understanding of the world formulated from sci-fi movies of the week will be seen and appreciated by everyone.Often the songs/screenplays/novels are atrocious mock-ups of well cultured three-dimensional classics that everyone in the world was inspired by. What flies over the head of most young artists is that what is considered inspirational is often brought about from the chaos of the evolving world. Socio-economic changes, shifts in national personality, new sciences, heck even hitting puberty all serves as potent inspiration for well cultured ideas portrayed through songs, film, paintings and of course books. Merely echoing a genius work only spotlights how little the shadower understands of the art. Much like how a math student can scribble the professor's workings on the chalk board and even calculate them, but not know how to create the formulas themselves. Like the bumbling math student, young writers/songwriters/actors often surf into a tunnel vision of perfection that leads not only to bad, predictable writing, but also to featherweight computer snap-pop, armor piercing rap music, limp wristed goth battle movies and cliques of fashion dojos. Teens need a standard of perfection and they look for it beyond their parents, namely in the glamor of a copy ad. The underlying mentality is \\"If you're good enough for tv, you're good enough for me!\\" The understanding with most children is that whatever worthwhile, and thus beautiful, is filmed. If they can be associated with what is beautiful, strong, courageous... perfect then they will be entitled to the riches of the world. Like all the clothing pinnups, teen be-bop songs and grainy online video contests this novel is just another ego enticement for the young. Like its cousins the novel is about as memorable as a phone jingle from a blackberry.I've alway's been irked by the old mantra that reading a book makes you smarter. Junk books exist as much as junk media, it's just that you can absorb and critique a movie much faster than a book. This is why movies take more flak for being horrible in general. People can see several movies much faster than they could read several books. No one has time to read a bad book... unless you are young enough get ensnared by the jungle trap of the marketing hunter."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Okay people, give Christopher a break. Of course it's been done before. EVERYTHING has been done before, especially in the Fantasy and Science Fiction genre. There just aren't a whole lot of options here. (Trust me, as a writer, I know.)I happen to think that Eragon is very well written. Mr. Paolini has an astounding grasp of dialogue and sets a scene better than a lot of authors old enough to be his parents (if not his grandparents even). His characters have depth, including flaws, and come across very three-dimensional instead of the paper cut-out roles I've read in many similar novels.This book is well-paced. It doesn't drag despite the distance and time covered by the characters. Mr. Paolini's fantasy world is well-constructed and believable.There is plenty of action, although it lacks a lot of the gore that Fantasy authors tend to fill their pages with. Not a bad thing at all from my perspective.I am looking forward to the continuation of the series, and whatever Mr. Paolini may have up his sleeve in the future. He is a swiftly rising talent, and I expect we will see a lot more of him."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I loved reading Eragon!!! it has a great introduction to the amazing series! it leads to a very exciring ad suspenseful series! just becuase of a Dragon, eragon gets a HUGE burden. the fate of alagasia rests on his shoulders&#8482;Copyright Super Ecstatic Reader!!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This may seem weird, but I looked at this novel a number of times trying to make up my mind...To purchase or not to purchase, the burning question.

I fell in love with the characters and the world that Christopher Paolini created (at the age of 15!) and have since recommended it to others. The book begins with a a sequence of events that leads back to the main character, the boy Eragon, and the possible resurrection of a group of blessed individuals known as the Dragon Riders. Along the path that the story lays down, Eragon is forced to examine himself and the narrow view he has of the world and how he has just become perhaps the most important person in that world. Without giving too much away, if you like Dragons, medieval settings, wonderfully engaging characters, and the promise of more to come from the other 3 books in the series then Eragon and the Inheritence Cycle are for you."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Lots of people who review this book spout: this book is unimaginitive, he ripped stuff off, why can't he write like a writer. Hell freezes over when someone reads a sentence, an angel loses it's wings, etc. The author was only fifteen when he wrote it, and he did an amazing job. Sure, it's a bit stiff, but it is a classic adventure story that loses you in it's pages. Eragon is a classic boy, has little character, but he does come across as a kid who will endure. And he does, through all his adventures. Another thing. Don't judge this book by the god awfull movie that you've maybe seen. This book wasn't done any justice by that movie."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This is a new series with old races and ideas such as elves, humans, dwarfs, magic, dragons etc. as well as some new ideas such as shades. It reminded me a lot of Anne McAfrey's Dragonriders of Pern series I read in high school, where humans and dragons share a telepathic link with one chosen person for life (both Mr. Paolini's and Mrs.McAfferey's books share this idea). I loved this book just as much as any of those if not a tad more. I am extremely interested to see just how Eragon and Saphira's tale will go and how it will end."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"My children just adore this book and the story keeps them captivated right up to the end.

But how many authors have copied vampire type themes after Twilight hit it big? Overall I enjoyed the characters and plot. A good book. I liked it better than \\"Eldest\\" the 2nd in the series.

That is why I said pre-teens will like this book. Even though it swears it was recommended to me by a friend and she is a total bookworm(so am i) plus she has good taste so i had to read it.

I love fantasy books, and this had plenty of what I like. The writing seems a little unpolished at times, but since the author was so young, allowances can be made. For another good fantasy book, I recommend Roderick Blackwood and the Demon Stone by Ralph Rathbone. It's much better than Harry Potter and makes for some exciting fantasy reading, with upstart magicians and demons in pin-striped suits."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Actually, I misspoke: there is nothing that is original in this book. The plot is taken from StarWars (or if you want to get technical, it is a by-the-book rendition of the Hero's Journey, something any fantasy reader has seen a billion times.) The characters are flat--even the main character, Eragon, tastes like the paper and ink he's made of, and he is moved through the very rigid plot through deus ex machina, more often than not. His relationship with the dragon Saphira is very hollow, and she \\"flies overhead\\" throughout most of the book, relegating her to the status of a nothing character. Brom is the typical \\"Wise Old Mentor\\" TM, and Arya...well, Paolini TELLS us that she's able to take care of herself, but she spends most of the book as the \\"Damsel In Distress\\" TM. Speaking of the telling and not showing, more often than not the book will TELL us what's going on rather than SHOWING us, TELL us what the characters are thinking and feeling rather than SHOWING us, and it starts to rankle, oh, about five chapters in. Now, one can put this up to the fact that the author never took a college (or even real high school) writing class, but it cannot be excused: it's simply lazy writing. Speaking of the writing, or more specifically the prose, it varies between short, stiff sentences with very little flow, and utterly purple prose remniscent of Tolkein at his utter worst. Then there's the fact that just about every ingenious part of this book came from someone else: the telepathic dragons and their riders from Anne McCaffrey's Dragonriders of Pern series, the world of Alagaesia from J.R.R. Tolkein's Lord of the Rings (although it was called Middle Earth then) complete with orcs (Urgals) and Uruk Hai (Kull) and nazgul (Ra'zac), gruff, earth-dwelling dwarves and graceful, long-lived, sylvan elves. There's also the transplanted magic system of Ursula Le Guin's Earthsea and the werecat from Garth Nix's Abhorsen series (Mogget, as opposed to Solembum). I would recommend every single one of these books over Eragon. Don't even read this on a rainy day; it would be a better idea to go catch pneumonia as you stand in the rain and watch the pages of this book disintegrate instead."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"As A.A.Milne said, \\"Almost anyone can be an author; the business is to collect money and fame from that state of being\\"...that being said, there is a difference between being an author and being a writer.An author who so blatantly has created a work based on others, with barely changing anything (Eragon--hmmm... Aragorn anyone?)is clearly not a writer--who can create something inspired by others, but still be completely original nonetheless. Look at all the fiction works out there about King Arthur. Paolini is certainly an author... but a writer???Yes, so Paolini was 15 when he wrote the book--is that really a great feat? To write something so plebian, with terrible dialogue that is so forced as to have made me literally laugh out loud while reading it?The real shame though, isn't that he was able to self-publish a book--who doesn't do that these days--it is that once he received a publishing contract (from Knopf no less) he didn't even receive an editor who was able to take something banal at best and make it great--which this book certainly has the possibility of being. Perhaps that is why Eldest came out so quickly but the 3rd one... where is that? Have they listened to critics? I haven't read the 2nd one... I will just out of curiosity but have heard it is actually worse... aren't writers (excuse me authors) supposed to get better as they mature and gain experience?So... why do I rate it 3 stars instead of one? Easy--it is sooooo entertaining! I mean, the ridiculously cryptic Brom, the easily persuaded Eragon... I have laughed more reading this book than when I ready guilty pleasure romance--which is highly amusing.So, if you are looking for an entertaining read--go ahead, pick it up, borrow it, get it from your library. BUT, if you are hoping to sink into a great work of fantasy fiction--re-read LOTR, or another of your favorites... you won't find \\"great original fantasy\\" here."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I enjoyed the book but I kept on thinking that I've read this book before.

Eragon has magic.Both Luke and Eragon are watched over by strange older men who eventually provide them with their first weapon (the very weapon that wiped out a set of good knights in the name of an evil emperor), taught them magic (the Force)and how to fight.The older man dies.Eragon frees a girl from a castle with the help of that wanted-by-the-law Rogue Murtagh.

The Emperor uses the Force to turn a Jedi Knight to kill off all of the good Jedi Knight.Are there more comparisons? Surely there are but my point has been made.On a different note, 3 of my high school students saw what I was reading and thought it was a novelization of the movie.

He started when he was fifteen, and finished when he was nineteen, which is truly a noteworthy accomplishment. This book has been hailed as a phenomenon, and has become an international bestseller. But honestly, I wrack my brain trying to understand how and why. For those who have read and love Eragon, I hope you become exposed to real fantasy and science fiction soon. For those of you who haven't read this, let me make a suggestion: read Lord of the Rings, and watch the original Star Wars trilogy. You'll know all you need to know about Eragon, and you'll save your money."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"One of the advantages of being a parent is having kids who recommend books for me to read. I am pleased that my son recommended the Harry Potter series to me. Not something I normally would have read, but I enjoyed the series immensely. And now, he is enjoying the Inheritance series by young Christopher Paolini, and convinced me to give it a read. I did so, even after reading the reviews on Amazon that criticized it for being derivative and unoriginal. And while I found certain elements to be derivative, one would have to go back several centuries, way past Tolkien, Lewis, Wagner and the rest, to find a work that is not, to some extent. Most of the modern fantasy stories, the good ones anyways, are heavily influenced by Norse and German mythology, and Eragon is no exception. I do not pretend to be an expert in this area (I am a military historian) but I do know that Tolkein and Lewis also borrowed heavily from ancient legend to craft the Rings books and the Narnia series. Paolini is like a young bard who, having learned from the masters before him, sets out to create his own universe using the rubrics of northern European mythology, and I think he succeeds.I have read all of Tolkein's work, as well as Lewis's, and I found Paolini's book to be as good a read as either. Perhaps because he is less encumbered with the need to pass on the Norse legends, Paolini's narrative flows quickly and there is rarely a break in the action as the story moves foreward. The characters are well-drawn and interesting. None are two-dimensional. The main characters are living, breathing individuals with a combination of good and bad inside. Even the important villains have a reason for being as evil as they are, though I hope Paolini goes into more detail on their backgrounds in books two and three.If you are looking for a fun, fast-paced fantasy adventure, I would highly recommend this book. It's not just for kids. This old dad liked it and is now working on 'Eldest'. Congratulations to my fellow Montanan Paolini on a good read!Four and a half stars."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"To echo the sentiments of many other reviewers, I am impressed by the fact that Christopher Paolini began this book, part one of a series, when he was only fifteen years old. This novel tells the story of Eragon (which is dragon spelled with an \\"e\\"), a young boy who finds a magical \`stone' that turns out to be a dragon egg. The egg hatches into amagical creature and Eragon discovers that he possesses the rare and coveted talent of being able to communicate with dragons. Eragon learns much from the dragon, as well as an ex-dragon rider named Brom, and comes to realize that he will play an important role in an impending conflict with evil to determine the fate of their land. They begin their adventures that take them to many mystical places and along the way the young Eragon slowly matures into a budding warrior clearly destined to save the world from the evil of King Galbatorix. I would not consider myself a \`fan' of fantasy fiction, which is probably why I liked thisbook. I have read Tolkien and I can clearly see his influence in Paolini's writing. However, I was somewhat disappointed in the shallowness of Paolini's characters and the lack of scene-description that made Tolkien's writings so incredibly popular. The concept of aselect breed of warriors destined to protect the world also seems to be quite Jedi-esque and the idea of dragon riders is borrowed as well. There are the common fantasy characters of elves and dwarves that many will recognize. But something tells me that those who are avid fantasy and science fiction readers may be somewhat disappointed in this novel. The pace is quick and the book is packed with plenty of action, enough to keep most readers interested to the end.If you like fiction, but are basically so-so when it comes to fantasy, you'll probably enjoy this book as I did. But if you consider yourself a master swordsman of science fiction and fantasy, then the borrowed concepts and inexperienced writing may leave you with a generic taste in your mouth, looking for a brand name item.Reviewed on behalf of readandreview [...]"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"If you've already read Tolkien and seen the first Star Wars movie, you're already familiar with the general setting and many of the characters in Eragon. If you've read Anne McCaffrey's Dragonriders of Pern you'll have most of the rest.Our hero is a teenager who has been raised by his uncle in a remote, lonely outpost; his father is unknown. Okay, so Luke Skywalker had an aunt as well; no matter, because Eragon's uncle, like Luke's, dies shortly after the trouble begins, leaving our young hero completely orphaned. Luckily, Eragon is befriended by a wise old mentor who can train him in the ways of his peculiar powers; it's Obi Wan - I mean, Brom. Intelligent readers will not be surprised by some of the major plot points that follow.It takes some time for Eragon to meet his disreputable comrade-in-arms Murtagh, the Han Solo figure, and by the end of the book we have been introduced at a distance to the Yoda of this series, who calls himself the Mourning Sage.Eragon does not travel through space, but a landscape much like Middle Earth, complete with a charming map inside the front cover of the book. There are both elves and dwarves in this world; the beautiful elf-maiden is not Arwen but Arya, and the inhuman soldiers fielded by the evil enemy are not the Uruk-hai, but the Urgals. Eragon does not first spy the lovely Arya in a hologram, but in a dream and by means of scrying. At one point, apropos of little, Eragon's mentor sings a sad song about elves who were parted by the sea; a nice touch but it lacks the resonance of Aragorn's ballad of a love that paralleled his own. Later our heroes enter a wood where the trees are ancient and exude a hostile atmosphere; shades of Fangorn, but nothing much comes of it.The book is a remarkable accomplishment for a teenaged author, and his teenaged hero is convincingly obtuse and immature. However, this work adds little or nothing to what has gone before it."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This is probably the worst book I have ever read.

Eragon held no such interest for me.Now, after all these... 'downs', it's not that I hated the book. I liked it to some extent. I see why so many kids here are angry at bad reviews.

And, I must say, I was rather pleased with the progress as I neared the end of the book.There was a bit of a lapse near the end, before the approach of Farthen Dur, that I wish could've been avoided; I almost considered stopping at this point, it bored me so.It picked up a bit before the last battle, and it was interesting enough at this point; again, I was entertained, but not necessarily blown away.The only recurring problem I had was the plot twists; often, they were predictable, and not as surprising or important to the story as I was hoping. The author does a great job leading suspense up to these revelations, however. It actually made it more of a letdown when they were finally revealed.All in all, it&#8217;s a good read. Paolini has some interesting ideas, many of which I would love to see fleshed out further in his remaining books.

(Sure he can write, but can he interact with his fellow human beings in social settings?) So I bought the book. Read the book. And I liked the book.Having had so many pre-conceived notions, made the first chapters difficult, but I was soon won over (although I though the opening preface was the dreadful writing of a D&D-playing; teen geek: I teach so I have seen this and worse!) by this (obvious!) homage to Tolkien.What I soon came to understand in this author is that things have been planned out in advance (especially after reading the second novel \\"Inheritance\\"). As with with most epics there are some slow goings at the beginning, characters and settings are being established and plotlines are being woven. This is the nature of the beast. Did I get bored? No, not really; once Sephira is born, the ball gets rolling!!!SO hype or not, I did enjoy this novel and it does present an undaunting task to any writer (whether he be a home schooled genius and D&D-playing; geek or not!)."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Many seem not to like this book for reason I can't understand.

I finished the new Harry Potter before the end of my vacation and ran into a book store to grab one. Having not much time the clerk suggested this book. Seeing it was in the young adult section with books I didn't even enjoy as a child (being too silly sometimes)...I was in doubt as to whether it was worth the money. However, I was in a rush so took it, all the while returning home regretting buying a book that was aimed for those younger than the typical HP fan.I will say that the saying \\"never judge a book by it's cover\\" stands true. This book is by far one of the most impressive books I have read in this genre. Fantasy is not my prefered genre so I am choosy. I am amazed that a man so young can write such a captivating book!!! It is well structured and fluid which is a definate must for books that are of a 'fantasy' nature.All in all I say read it even if you are not a big fantasy fan. If you like HP or the Phillip Pullman trilogy then this will be your cup of tea! The only thing I will say is that I wouldn't let my younger relatives read this because within the first few pages there are many deaths so I say caution to parents of children 12 and under."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"The book Eragon by Christopher Paolini is the best book i have ever read."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This is a riviting book but has a bit more gore than I prefer and I know Hollywood will take advantage and make it a PG13 R when many of the readers are christion and will not see a PG13 or R rated movie.

But after the great trilogy of the Lord of the Rings, I think it's hard for authors to write fantasies that are going to be better and different. After all we can't keep reading the same good fantasy books over and over again, we need something new. And that new book is Eragon. I think that Paolini did a good job. Eragon is a very interesting and good book to read. I would recommend it to any fantasy lovers out there. And I can't wait to read the next book of the inheritance trilogy.Also I don't think that Tolkien would be rolling over in his grave. I think he would be proud that he has made a path for young author to follow. Tolkien didn't care about his fame, he cared about the literature.I doubt that the author was trying to beat Tolkien's ghost at his own game. I bet JRR Tolkien would have read the book and enjoyed it. Plus it's only the first book in the trilogy. There is still more of the story to go.I recommend that you give Eragon a try and pay no attention to those who gave the book 1 or 2 stars"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"The bottom line is that this book was written by a fifteen-year-old and has the immature style that is to be expected from someone so young. The book has potential, but there are all those niggling details to take care of. I see that it was published by his parent's publishing company, which explains a lot. I don't think a major publishing house would have touched it without major editing.

It kept me interested until the last word of the last sentance of the last paragraph of the last page. It was amazing. It is about a boy. This boy is named Eragon. He is a poor farm boy he needs to get his family meat. So he goes hunting. What he finds is not the deer that he is looking for but a smooth blue stone. He picks it up and is about to put it back when he realizes that it may be able to buy his family some meat. He offers it to the butcher but when he hears where it is from he will not take it. The next night it hatches. That is all I can tell you without giving the book away. This book about a boy and his dragon is fantastic! Once you start you can't wait finish.

Paolini does not copy Tolkien's writing excessively, though, but Robert Jordan of the Wheel of Time. The similarities are unmistakable. Example: the mountain range called the Spine, similar to the exact same mountain range above and beyond coincidence. It's useless to point them all out. To Paolini's credit, though, while writing a pretty traditional fantasy book, he somehow manages to keep you reading. Read this book if you are looking for a nice story that will keep you immersed until you sadly reach the end. It is sitting infront of me right now, and I need to stop writing this review so I can enjoy it. In my mind, Paolini's book is very much worth reading."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I've been trying to find some rich, detailed fantasy lately.

He has a big heart and always thinks of others before himself. He becomes a dragon rider after he finds Saphira's egg. Saphira is the other main character of the story she is a dragon that was hatched after Eragon found her egg. She has a strong sense of humor. Eragon wanted to avenge his uncles death.

I read this book in one day, I just couldn't put it down. And I'm certainly looking forward to the next in the series. If you're looking for something different, \\"Eragon\\" is not the novel for you, but otherwise it is a very enjoyable read."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"When I first began to read a book I immediately remembered writing stories in HS a few years back. The writing style is very similar and simple. Within the first few chapters I became a bit annoyed since you can tell (through probably no conscious act of his own) the author drew on Tolkein's work in certain aspects of his story, characters and so on... as well as some very small similarities to Anne McCafferey. I normally wouldn't care, but with so much enthusiasm surrounding the books, I do have to point out that this IS fantasy, and certain things to HAVE to be as always displayed. Great fantasy books have always deviated from the norm in comparison to stereotyping certain breeds of characters. The fact that these breeds were so cut and dry almost made me put down the book.To my delight, it got better. The writing got more and more sophisticated, which it will as one grows older, and there were less points of comparison to other fantasy novels. The story is of course an average fantasy story line, but come on, I DOUBT anyone gets tired of those. Besides, most of it is quite fun and although I have sneaking suspicions about thing we'll find later in the series, I am not automatically able to guess how things turn out, which is obviously a positive thing.All in all a great start, I hope that the author comes more into his own in the following books, and grows along with his characters. As I am within the same age range as him, I have this to say:I have always wanted to write. Many many ideas flutter through my head for the most incredible stories, but the act of putting them coherently to paper is NOT an easy task. Never underestimate the difficulty of conveying a point. This is why I look forward to a good long run of books by C.P. and hope that, as most do, he grows and fulfills what I think is his great potential for writing.Good Luck~C.P. May things never get to difficult for you.and, to everyone else, ENJOY this is fun bit of fiction to pull you from the otherwise depressing life most of us have. Get past the first few chapters and don't expect too much (I always find that going into a book and expecting the world... I am ALWAYS disappointed. Even with my favorite books upon re-reading them)"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I am an avid reader but have not found many books that interest my children as they do me.

I didn't like it; in fact, I never finished the novel and gave to a friend -- who also didn't particularly like the novel, but finished it anyway. First, it was very poorly written. You can tell a teenager with little life experience wrote the novel. Second, The dialogue is stilted and immature at the same time. Third, The characters are very two dimensional, and there is nothing original in this novel. The writers pulls from many sources: Tolkien (of course, who doesn't), Robert Jordan, Anne McCaffrey, and Terry Brooks among them. So why did I come back to it and give the story 3 stars? I enjoyed the audio version. Gerard Doyle rises above some of the bad dialogue and gives each character a voice of his or her own; and by the end of the story I find myself interested enough to listen to the next novel, again read by Gerard Doyle."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I have just started reading the fantasy genre and was a little skeptical on what to expect.

Now, I again find myself drawn to an author of similar fascination.After Hurricane's Katrina and Rita, with all the malls closed in New Orleans, Barnes and Nobles closed, Amazon wouldn't ship to me as I was in the impacted area, and no resource available to buy books, I drove to Baton Rouge. There, while wandering the aisles with my arms piled high with over a hundred dollars worth of books, determined not to be caught without books to read again, I happened to see Paolini's books \\"Eragon\\" and \\"Eldest\\" highlighted on a shelf. I bought them both.I must admit that \\"Eragon\\" immediately brought me under it's spell. While occasionally you are pulled out of the story when you find a name or setting similar to Tolkein's trilogy it has an addicting spirit all it's own.Paolini's characters are strong and speak with individual voices.

Young adult readers between fifteen and seventeen should thoroughly enjoy reading this book, although parents should be cautioned that at times the content of this novel occasionally leans towards violence and the grotesque, such as when the author describes a baby mounted on a spear over a pile of slaughtered villagers.The seasoned reader will find that this novel is too simple, overly formulaic and rather predictable in that it follows the same plot and themes to a greater or lesser extent as the Star Wars series. In other words, although the author has yet to confirm some of the details, the reader has been given enough information to deduce these similarities:A young farm boy raised by his (aunt and) uncle because his mother wished to hide him from his father, an evil fallen knight, accidentally receives a package stolen from the empire which leads to the death of his uncle, the destruction of his home, and a hasty flight from all that he knows and loves. The farm boy soon discovers and accepts a mentor who is more than he seems.This mentor, who was once a great knight, gives him his father's magic sword, and after introducing him to the ways of the old knighthood, willingly dies at the hands of the empire's servants to save the farm boy. This leads to the introduction through chance of a long lost, still unrealized, sibling who like Eragon / Luke is a child of a fallen hated knight. Their father, like Vader, also betrayed and helped hunt down his fellow knights.The similarities continue down to smaller details such as helping the princess escape, the evil fallen knights sword being red, a hatred of slavery, a terrible battle where our hero saves the rebellion by performing a nearly impossible task in combat shortly after finding the rebel's hidden base, and finally a magic summons to a new master who will complete Eragon's training as a knight.Paolini will have a difficult task if he decides to break from this mould now that it is set, in that doing so he will create fractures and inconsistencies between books and will leave the readers of his works frustrated at the irrelevant information that they had previously been given. In order to remain Gricianly cooperative (see Grice's Maxims), Paolini is stuck with the plot and details listed above until they are revealed or fulfilled.In short, this book has a difficult time fitting into a safe age category. It is too violent for younger children, but too predictable for a seasoned audience. If you or your older children have to read something, and have read everything else, you may want to consider this book. It certainly isn't worse than Shadow Puppets by Orson Scott Card or the endless go-nowhere Wheel of Time series by Robert Jordan."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Eragon does suck and Dragons: Lexicon Triumvirate is much better.

The one thing I will say that a lot of people compare this to Star Wars and Lord of the Rings, but the formula written from the books and movies was borrowed from Jung who discovered \\"The Heroes Journey\\" and from that certain events always happen. Jung discovered this when he traveled the world and found that all stories of myth, lore, and others have similar patterns which we have always borrowed and drawn upon. Just take that into consideration before comparing it to the movies and books because unfortunately it's not something that was just invented by Lucas and Tolkien but has dated back to the Greeks and further.If you enjoy dragon stories and myth, I'd recommand it.

My appreciation of the book grew even stronger when I read the author bio and found out how incredibly young Mr. Paolini is and was when writing the book. To have that much creative talent and to be able to put it to that much use at such a young age is a marvelous acheivement unto itself.On to the book however, I thought that the world that Christopher created and the characters and social structures within it were very well detailed and defined. The story moved along at a nice pace with very little downtime. It is very well written and engages the reader to want to continue reading, leaving you hungry for the next novel in the series.My only complaint, and it is a minor one, is that some of the dialog is not very strong. I mostly noticed this at the beginning of the book and it seemed to smooth itself out as the story progressed. But, a the start, I kind of felt like I was watching a movie with 2nd or 3rd rate actors. Like I said, it wasn't too bad and it got much better, but I feel that my review would have been lacking without mentioning it."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I am a big Triligy fan, I have sighned books and everything.I have allready read both books twice, and they still never cease to amaze me.It all starts when Eragon is hunting and he finds a dragon egg, witch he thinks is a stone.

MUCH better than the movie."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Considering a 15 year old wrote this, it is pretty darn good! I was immediately hooked with the opening scene cutting through the forest till the dragon egg is found in the Spine. The story progresses nicely, but I found once it hit 500 pages or so, it lagged a little at certain points. Some of it is understandable because the author is filling you in with information that was kept from Eragon and the reader alike as well as setting the reader up for the next installment. Paolini goes to great lengths to make this truly his own; he has created languages, lore, and a map of his world. I enjoyed Eragon's growth and training with Brom the most. Their travels make up a good part of the book and I was never let down. After Eragon arrives as a true Dragon Rider the book picks up again after its brief lag and has a nice finale that leaves you wanting more with the next installment. I am going to get that as soon as I finish some others. I recommend giving this book a try because it is much different then some of the other books out there."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Not great but not as bad as everyone makes it sound.

He and Rowling are some of my favorite fantasy authors."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Hey,I just finished the book as in the last fifteen minutes. I won't give away anything don't worry. I just wanted to get on and see when the second one that he is writing is supposed to come out. But I was reading other reviews and people kept saying how it was like Lord of the Rings and Eragon sounded like Aragorn and stuff. One I've read Lord of the Rings twice and I didn't notice drastic similarities. Maybe I was to engrossed in the story but you should be too. Also Eragon and Aragorn while sound alike didn't strike me as having anything to do with each other. I thought it was cool and that was one of the first things that struck was the fact that the book was about a boy and dragons and the main character's name was spelled like dragons only instead of a 'd' he used the next letter in the alphabet. There was also two other books mentioned that I've never read so can't argue about. But I mean what you've read will end up leaking into you're writing a little bit. It's only to be expected. I really liked it and thought that it was very original. I think it's cool that someone so young can get a book published. I'm thirteen and want to be an author and I am trying to write a book (I doubt it will go anywhere but you never know) so I think it's really cool that he can get this published. So go read it. It's Eragon, don't forget because then you won't be able to find and READ IT! It was SO SO SO good. Now I'm going to go back to trying to find when the next one comes out.

He copied Lord of The Rings and I'm not kidding. Based on the title of my review, his book is terrible, and he being 18 years old is the cause of it, being an inexperienced and terrible writer. One part in the book where Brom says sorry, goes like this: \\"Sorry,\\" apologized Brom. Apologized? That does not make sense, because he already is apologizing and therefore does not have to say \\"apologized Brom.\\" The words in the Elvish language or whatever is just a jumble of words put together: jfoaehfdhfh!Whoever said that this book was written before the Lord of The Rings movie and the book, guess what? YOU'RE SO [...]WRONG!!!!!The LOTR books happened to be written and published nearly 50 years ago. I'm not exaggerating. Also the movies are based on the BOOKS. It's not just a movie made up by Peter Jackson!!

I thought it could have been much better, if more time had been taken. But, even through all this it was a generally OK book.

It also does not yield all its secrets in the first instalment of the trilogy.Despite the clich&eacute;s the characters in this book are likeable and well written, and Eragon, the central character of the story is not overwhelmed in character, even by his dragon, which makes a nice change. The way they are written make you want to come back for book 2 in the series when it is published, and certainly that is a sign of a book you enjoyed."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"One of my favorite books. I couldn't put it down. Adventure and fantasy lovers can't miss this story--it's a must!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"In case you're wondering, I reviewed earlier. I was the one who compared Arya (a bland heroine) to Eowyn (a complex heroine).Anyway, I'm writing this because I felt I didn't make it clear whether I liked this book or not. Bottomline is: I sort of like this book. It's an entertaining read. Still, I won't take back what I said in my earlier review. The story is too predictable, the characters are bland, etc. etc.I also refuse to cut him some slack for being only fifteen when he started to write this book. I will give him some credit for effort. It's an excellent start for an inexperienced writer. However, any writer who gets published must put in more effort. Surely, any writer with plans for publishing would go over the book at least three or four times, correcting not only grammatical errors but also plot holes, bad pacing, useless descriptions, etc. The book was too long. His story could have been told in at least a hundred fewer pages and would have been much better, too. As for the youth factor, look at The Outsiders by S. E. Hinton. It's a wonderful book with taut plotting, beautiful characterization, clear prose, and enough description so I can visualize the characters, setting, and events without it clogging the progression of the story. Hinton was only sixteen when she wrote this book. See, a young writer can write a superb, original classic based on tensions between the upper and lower classes that was hailed by finicky critics (I agree, professional critics can be unfair sometimes.) and loved by the public as well.I KNOW critics praised this book, and the majority loves it. Still, I am rather mystified why many competent critics failed to notice the bad characterization and predictable cliches. I understand why kids and adolescents my age love it. It's action-packed and entertaining. I don't believe it will ever become a classic, though. It's too. . .generic. Many classics became classics through shocking ideas, brilliant prose, memorable characters, gripping storylines, or all of the above. Eragon has none of these.As for those people who claim that people who don't like the book are being mean to Paolini, that it's just a kids' book, they don't know good literature, it really is original, who cares about originality, etc., etc...Paolini needs constuctive criticism to better his writing. Some reviews are downright mean, but some are tremendously insightful. I would rather have been told what's wrong or great about my book rather than \\"It sucks\\" or \\"It's great.\\" As for the it being a kids' book, it mentions attempted rape and torture. While the book is clearly aimed at a younger audience, I find the book to hover between young adult (twelve and up) and children (under twelve). Books for kids don't have to have mediocre for them to be loved. Also, it's not particularly original. No point to elaborate since I pointed it out in my earlier review. Originality isn't the most important thing in writing. A book can be totally original and can still suck due to bad writing. However, a book needs enough imagination, a good plot, great writing, impeccable grammar, and interesting characters. Without these, an entertaining story would be seen as nothing but trash. However, a book with all the technical details, but is totally boring would be loved by critics but probably wouldn't do well financially. I guess you have to look at the whole picture. Everyone has their own opinions though so I won't claim I'm totally right. You can ignore everything I said if you want.Whew, I write long reviews, don't I?A reviewer"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Good fantasy books are about structuring imagination; great fantasy applies a sense of real world maturity to that imagination. That's what made \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" so powerful, its complete world captivates us while its complex story line fulfills us. Christopher Paolini seems to understand this in his first book \\"Eragon\\".Every year there's always a book released attached to a gimmick. In 2003 it was Eragon, a book written by a teenager. In fact when Paolini started Eragon he was 15. So it was an amazing surprise to learn what a fine and smart writer Paolini is becoming. Paolini tells the tale of Eragon, a caring, smart, but immature teenager who happens upon a dragon egg. The egg hatches and the baby dragon that immergences from within bonds with Eragon, creating not only an inseparable relationship but also a series of problems for the both of them. Like much fantasy, it is a story drawn in broad shades of black and white, but it's also a story of self-discovery. Eragon over times develops from boy to man and it is here that Paolini makes this more than good fantasy; he makes his mark as a surprisingly mature writer with a solid future.Eragon is the first book of a series, so the book ends a bit to abruptly. Still I'm very curious to see how this series and Paolini develop over the course of time."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I gave this book a four because I respect the young writer and it's truly a good book. The setting is in a place called Carvahall and in a distant mountain region. A kid named Eragon is a hunter looking for meat to feed him and his family for the winter. In the forest he stumbles upon a dragon egg and it turns out it happens to be a dragon egg. Then Eragon learns to be a rider. I thought the story was exciting at some parts and mostly a bunch of traveling around. An element represented most in this story is irony. I really thought that Eragon would sell the egg that he thought was a rock. I would recommend this book to someone who likes a good fantasy-fiction."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I reccomend this book to all young adult readers.

I'm not surprised that lots of other kids like this book, it was sorta fun and exciting (key word: sorta). The other main reason I didn't enjoy this book was because so much of it was copied from LOTR, which I read also.

I read and re-read this book god-knows-how-many times, and still love it!! It is an excellect beginning to the author's career, and although the writing is somewhat corny at rare times, he still is a beginner at writing. The book left me reading late into the night and reminded me of the excellent classic fantasies of Tolkien and Pierce that it seems you don't see enough of. It's one of those books you read on a snow day or an a day you can just sit down for a long time and just read. This book is best enjoyed when you have time to read most- if not all- of it. It is a hefty book, and if you are a \\"light\\" reader, this is probably not the book for you. If you are worried about the book being all about blood and gore with no story whatsoever, don't worry- although some of it can be graphic, there is a wonderful plot (I'm running out of words to describe it!!)and it's about more than just the battle scenes.

I have found this book very much high on the list of my older elementary students. Eragon is so believable that they identify with him almost immediately. Though the writing looks as if three different people wrote it (one for the beginning, one for his travels and another for the war and the underground city) it does flow. There were a few errors grammatically, but all in all a very enjoyable book. It relies heavily on 'other' fantasy books that are also favorites, but it just adds to the reading enjoyment of those who were hooked on \\"The Hobbit\\", \\"Lord Of The Rings\\" or even the Harry Potter books. Since I like to read the books my students read, I have to admit I enjoyed it. It is not the five stars of the above named books (yes, I LOVED Harry Potter), but it is a good read.

If you expect it to be and you read it, you'll be severly disappointed. In fact, when you read something, or watch a movie, don't expect anything of it, or else you'll be disappointed, because nothing is good enough when you expect something really good. Believe me, I know what I'm talking about. Anyway, Eragon is not a great book, but it's at least good. Sure, it has traces of LotR, the Earthsea books, and amazingly, Star Wars, but it is still a good book. Let's get this straight: ELVES existed in books before LotR was written, and so did DWARVES and DRAGONS. Also, I do not think Paolini meant for the name Eragon to be like Aragorn. He just switched the \\"D\\" in dragon, with an \\"E\\". I'm sure this is the case. Second, so what if it's a lot like Lord Of The Rings? I've read the LotR trilogy 2 times, yet I still liked this book. So, you LotR fanatics who never think anthing is good enough, try writing a book as good as, or better then LotR, or even Eragon. Half of you don't even know proper english. So, stop complaining and enjoy the book. Anyway, if you have the money, and the time to read this book, go ahead and read it. It's good, light, reading, that you should be able to enjoy, if you're not an idiot who thinks slightly unoriginal books, or even fanfiction are bad. Face it, people are influenced with what they see and read.

The main character is a boy named Eragon who first thought he never would or could do anything special - but he was wrong. Eragon grew up as a farmboy and one day he found a stone in a forest called the Spine. He tried to sell what he thought was a stone for meat but nobody bought the saphire stone.It turned out that the stone was a dragon egg. One night Eragon was awakened by a squealing sound and he noticed that the sound was coming from the egg. He was amazed when he saw a little dragon suddenly staring at him with his dark, mysterious and piercing blue eyes. When he touched it he felt a sensation burning his hand and when he looked at it he saw a symbol. What did it all mean?It turned out that the symbol meant Eragon was to be a Dragonrider. The dragon's name was Saphira and Eragon and Saphira would always be linked to each other from that day on. Eragon and Saphira traveled and met a lot of dangers. They worked together to fight off evil creatures with the help of an old man named Brom.

Kudos to you, Christopher Paolini, for this book. OK. That's it. No more going easy.One of the most overpowering factors against the book for me was its lack of characterization. While even authors such as C. S. Lewis can be accused of this, Eragon was not balanced by an abundance of good plotting or descriptiveness. The characters are shallow, most doing exactly what any stereotypical individual in their role would have done. For example, Brom's technique to teach Eragon in magic and swordfighting was probably original by the first of the myriad authors who have used it... It any case, characterization is one of the most difficult factors to include, as well as one of the least looked-for in some cases.As for the plot, it existed, but thinly. Where in some books events are logical and effectively build up to the climax, Eragon's honestly didn't seem to occur in any particular order... It was more of a random jaunt around the countryside.Speaking of the country, one of the things that I will applaud Mr. Paolini for is his world-creation. A roleplayer at heart, one of my greatest hobbies has been the generating of fantastic places, including governmental systems, local feuds, everything down to outstanding individuals in smal towns. Because of this, I can honestly say that the detail that was included in the world was rather impressive. Each city and place fit into the overall world smoothly, with exotic locations aplenty.Unfortunately, the book seems to be fairly predictable. Once the exposition is presented, one can almost figure out the general events of the book oneself, without bothering to read the rest of the book or its sequels. Things that were clearly meant to be twists were predictable, and certain parts of the storyline seemed to hamper the development of the plot.Overall, it's fairly well-written. I wouldn't say that this was the next great classic, and it has indeed sold as well as it has probably because of the author's age. I say again, Mr. Paolini did well for a young adult on his first book. Let's hope that both he and his writing skills have matured for the second."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"There isn't much that I can say that hasn't already been said about the book, but sufficed to say that I agree entirely with B. Capossere. Eragorn is in essence an amalgam of multiple other stories - LOTR, Dragonriders, and Earthsea springing immediately to mind. It's not to say that Paolini isn't to be commended for his efforts, but as Capossere states, if this had been written by an adult, it would be far less than what it has been made to be.The beginning of the story was a struggle, with akward and stilted descriptions and sluggish phrases. However, the story does pick and Paolini finds his pace, though with the occasional hiccup when cliches are glaringly obvious. It lacks the polish that I associate with writers such as Tolkien, Orson S. Card (most of his books), Stephen Gould, Asimov, etc. With them, I can pick up their books and almost literally fall into their world, see and feel and BELIEVE their characters. With Eragon, the story does flow, but more often than not one realises that the scenarios are all too familiar, that we've seen this somewhere before.Though I sound negative, I still feel that Paolini did an outstanding job - given his age. I look forward to seeing what more he comes up with in the future, and hope to see him developing ideas of his own."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"The farm-boy Eragon is charged with confronting and stopping the powerful emperor Galbatorix and the sundry and sordid characters allied with him from once-and-for-all taking control of all parts of Alagaesia. Once he is trained by Brom, the erstwhile dragonrider, in certain martial arts and magic, Eragon will become, with his trusty sidekick dragon Sapphira, dragonrider par excellence and ally with elves, dwarves, werecats, witches and the pariah Murtagh. But 500 pages do not resolve the plot; this is but the first in a supposed trilogy chronicling the multiple bloody battles that ensue. The strength of this book is the language and pacing. Paolini, himself a young adult, is a formidable stylist in the genre using rich and colorful language to develop characters and create powerful images while avoiding the mind-numbing hackneyed and stilted language that sometimes creeps into sci fi/fantasy. While the plot itself is unspectacular, the sequence of events he chronicles keeps the reader's interest level high. This is top-shelf fantasy fiction writing that is sure to appeal to the fantasy reader of any age starting with an accelerated 10-or 11-year old. However, the reader should be warned that this is a dark fantasy with little humor or even much hope; it can be quite grim in parts. Eragon himself often questions the merit of his actions, and whehter anything he does will really effect change in a meaningful way."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I have this book and while it is a good read I have to agree with B. Capossere's review of the book. While reading this book, I also saw the comparisons with Star Wars and the Lord of the Rings. For example, take the title of the book, ERAGON. If you've read the Lord of the Rings or seen the movie, you can definitely see the link to Tolkien. As for the Star Wars link, that goes into more of the plot of the book but again, it is defnitely apparent. I also saw a link to Dungeons and Dragons while reading. The story is different but the names are taken on the basis of other works and I think that even for a 17 year old, there should be more imagination in the world created. Would the story have lost it's appeal if different names were used? I don't think so. But it is a let down in the imagination aspect when similar names and events are used because your mind automatically goes to the other stories."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"When Eragon stumbles upon a strange rock in the Spine while hunting, he never expected it to hold his future inside. This \`rock' was actually a Dragon egg, and when it hatched for Eragon he had to keep it secret, for if he were to be exposed as a Dragon Rider he would have to fight the empire. Eragon's decisions will change the fate of his Kingdom.Eragon was amazing, though hard to get into in the first two chapters, ended up unfolding into the most amazing world of action, betrayals, friendships, and life defining decisions. Eragon's Allegaisia was not difficult to understand or too complicated to follow. Christopher's writing style is easily understood, and very engrossing. There are few who will not enjoy the amazing tale of Eragon and his Dragon."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Please find this review helpful!

One day, he discovered a lost \\"trinket\\" that was fought and killed for- bad guys wanted it REAL badly, and the keeper of it, a beautiful young woman, sent it away for safekeeping. He does not know this. He takes it home. He soon meets a mysterious old man. One afternoon he returns home to find his uncle and aunt murdered by the bad guys looking for this valuable thing to help them conquer the world and smash a rebellion. Then the mysterious old guy and the young guy go on an epic adventure.If you think I am talking about \\"Star Wars: A New Hope,\\" you're wrong.I'm talking about Eragon.Yeah, it's well-written... for a seventeen-year-old. Did anyone mention that he was homeschooled? That his parents are pro editors (or something like that)? Honestly, I am two years younger than he was while writing this book and my writing is just as good as his. But my parent's aren't editors, and I am constantly swamped with homework. And so the many stories and the fantasy novel I started in March (which is almost finished) will likely never be published, and never a #1 New York Times Bestseller.Must I complain? No. This book it an entertaining read and gave me some good ideas for mine, which heavily involves dragons as well. But some advice to Paolini- read some more books yourself. Get some better, more original ideas. Not to say that mine are less familiar. But hey, if so much excitement could be sparked by a 17 yr old boy's novel, what about a 15 yr old girl's? Guess I can hope.And some advice to filmmakers while I'm at it- Don't make a movie of this. Please. Make one of Dragonlance or the tale of Beren and Luthien or Dragons in our Midst instead.And I'll laugh hysterically if what's-her-name the elf chick and Eragon turn out to be close relatives.Please... no."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Earagon ,a gallant character, finds a dragons egg and thinks it's a rock.

A lot of reviewers have dissed Paolini becuase supposedly his parents \\"owned their own publishing company.\\" Well that is FALSE. His parents self published some books of their own, and they helped him self publish Eragon, but the key here is SELF-PUBLISHED. While I don't personally like the book (too cliche for me) I have to give him a hand for how he marketed it. Paolini did it the good old American way by publishing the book himself and then fighting tooth and nail to get people to buy it, by traveling the country, giving his own lectures in libraries and schools, and trying to sell it himself in bookstores. To make a long story short, he worked hard to get Eragon picked up by a traditional publishing company, so whether you liked the book or not, stop giving him a hard time for something that is not accurate."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Dude people you are all such fools Eragon is the longest, most tedious and sloppily written fantasy my dad ever spent 20 bucks for. Mr. Paolini takes something out of Lord of the rings, something out of Dragonrider books, and something out of Harry potter even--but doesnt add ennough of his own crap into the mix. Dungeons and dragons-lovers might enjoy it, but i found the writing hard to take--its just unsubtle and cliched, thats what it is. Eragon is a one-dimensional character, all the people have funny names like Brom and all the places are called Yazuac and theres this sword called Zar-roc. OK how do you pronounce that?All this can be forgiven if it wasnt for that Yazuac scene; read the lousy book and youll know what i mean.

If you'll check out Paolini's website, you'll see the arrogance he's developed from writing a mediocre pulp fantasy book that thinks it's going to be a classic."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Well, where do I begin with this review....Perhaps it would be best to start off how I came by this piece of literature. I was fortunate (unfortunate by some peoples considerations) enough to hear about this book early on. I was a junior at the time of it's release. Now you must understand I do not mean the Random House re-release. I read this book when it was still being published by his own family and still unknown greatly.Well, to get back to how it started I went to my high schools library looking for a book to pass the time. The librarian handed me this newly arrived book called \\"Eragon\\". A large dragon's eye ornated the otherwise white book. I found it intrigueing, so I began to read.Regrettably judging books by their covers goes both ways. I was not impressed with the book compared to books I had just previously read. You must understand I had just finishe reading all of Goodkind's \\"Sword of Truth\\" series as well as finishing off my re-reading of the \\"Dune\\" series. Needless to say \\"Eragon\\" does not stack up to these books in no way shape or form.Yet I still must give Christopher credit, he took the time to write this book and it was not incredibly bad. It just lacked in certian areas, and as someone has previously stated, it seems to be a melting pot of the greats. That was deluted with simplicity, the over-use of verbs, and the un-realism of characters.It is hard to say there is an unrealism to characters in a fantasy novel, but I shall try to elaborate. I do not mean that dwarves or shades in a book is unrealistic. Oh no, I speak of the personalities of the characters. Their reactions to trials and events. Eragon, as a character, jumped all over the place. At times he seemed nothing more than a boy. Within minutes he was an braver and \\"stronger\\" than an experianced warrior.I was going to list the similarites this book has held to all the others but it seems everyone else has done so. I would like to had however that similiarites is not always bad to a degree. I do not think my previous counterparts meant \\"Oh, Poalini used Elves, but Tolkien did first. He is a copier.\\" It was the originality of Tolkien's Elves that made them great. Their culture, personality, etc. Christopher's were the same. This can be said for the dwarves as well. A perfect example of differances is R.A Salvatore's \\"Demon Wars\\" saga. While keeping the secrative nature of Elves the same, Salvatores Elves were small in stature, preferred to fly, and so on.I do realise this review is getting long and overdrawn so let me get to the point. A few days after I had read his book. Christopher Paolini came to my school for a speech and book signing. It all came to clear, the un-realism of his characters, the unknown of similarities.After hearing this boy speak, as well as talking to him afterwards to get my book autographed. It was obvious, you see Christopher Paolini was homeschooled all through school. There is nothing wrong with this, but as he talked to a room full of lounging seniors, overworked juniors, egoed sophmores, and nervous freshman, it was clear he did not understand kids his own age. With-out the people skills that school gives you, for yes it does, it seems he will never write believeable characters until he learns that lesson. I do keep my hopes up for the second book, perhaps finally he will have matured some.I would have given this book a 3 stars, but after his speech it made many people want to quit writing even. He spoke of how tedious it was and how boring it was to research. Perhaps another reason I didn't exactly like it. I myself have done some minor writing, mainly helping my friends who are serious about it. Research is great but he spoke of \\"The book that ate him alive.\\" This is a term that does not attract new readers and writers."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"For all the hype this book has received, I have to admit I was very disappointed by it. While the general plot is compelling, I have trouble taking seriously an author who has so little grasp of how to use the English language that he describes houses as \\"foreboding\\"(130), and much less his editor who let that slide. No person speaks like his characters do, and presuming the time period is sixteenth century or earlier, their expressions lean toward the anachronistic to say the least. His writing style is pretentious, as though he feels the need to impress by using his SAT words (incorrectly, sometimes) and as many people do, confuses good writing with frequent use of long words. Want an example of a passage so cheesy you want to cringe? \\"He saw a young woman, bent over by sorrow, chained in a cold, hard cell. A beam of moonlight shone through a barred window set high in the wall and fell on her face. A single tear fell down her face, like a liquid diamond.\\" (212). That was beautiful. Really. To be honest, I found this book more fun to make fun of than to take seriously. As long as you take it, the writing, and the philosophy Brom spouts- worldly wisdom and life experience from a fifteen year old writer, it's great- with a pinch of salt, it's a fun read. Maybe after the experience of a first book, Paolini will improve with Eldest."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Hmmm. I liked this series. It is good, well written which is a surprise because paolini was 16 when he wrote eragon. There is a good plot, mysterious characters, questionable allies, horrifiying enemies, elves, dwarves and ... dragons.which basically meanis that paolini hit every cliche in the fantast genre.Not only that but the gedwey ignasia ( is that how it is written) is reminiscent of Edding's Garion and the white mark on his palm. The dragon is reminiscent of the dragons of McCaffrey's Pern. Even the jokes in later books(though subtle) are sometimes reminiscent of Eddings.not one original thought. (again not surprising - remember sixteen). Still, the plot is promising and I hope that Paolini develop his story better.

God.It seems Lord of the Rings (a thing I dislike) and Star Wars (a thing I despise) got together and made this unholy book called Eragon.The plot is boring and slow. It uses every clich&eacute; in the Fantasy book. A magical sword, dragons-trolls-(beautiful) elves, a farm boy, etc. And do you know what? It's not even original.

In Eragon however it is much easier to understand and lack of a better word less dry. I believe this book is the starting of a new kind of fantasy. Written by a teen it helps teens relate something Tolkien could not do. And who can blame Christopher for copying things from his favorite stories?

I've read the book at least 5 times and it just gets better, and better, and better. The book takes you to a magical place full of wonder and excitement, which is what makes it such a great book. I think it's really fun to read a book from a time of mythological creatures, wizardry, and the fight against the forces of evil. It really has inspired my life in so many ways that it's unbelievable. It such a great book and if you get the chance, take the time and read it because it really is a phenomenal book."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Eragon is a great read, I have to say. As an aspiring writer, I am extremely jealous of Paolini for what he has created. He has made a standard fantasy: quests, mentors who make big sacrifices, possible love interests, evil kings, huge revelations, the appearance of the classic dwarf, elf, and dragon, and much more. But it also adds new ideas: dragons being good, and tame enough for riding, interesting, different creatures like the werecat, the Raz'zac, the Urgals and Kull, and a new land that will bring Middle Earth to mind.Many people will scoff upon this book, hailing it as a rip off of Lord of the Rings and other fantasies. I myself have a friend who is a huge LotR fan, and by looking at the map (the lake Isentar is a TOTAL rip of Isengard), said the same.Granted, there are some parallels. For those who have read the Hobbit, you will know that there is a long journey to the final destination which can be boring at times, and exciting at others. When they get to their destination, there is an epic battle towards the ending of the book, and at the end of the chapter, the protagonist blacks out and the outcome of the fight is explained to him (that was the closest parallel I noticed). Come to think of it, Harry Potter had that too. It must be a very widely-used way to close out a book. But for the most part, the plot is original, with the classic characters thrown in.Paolini is an extremely descriptive writer, and that is part of what makes this book so good: you can paint a clear image in your mind of Eragon's homeland Alagaesia, the dwarf city Tronjheim, and other locations in the story. Sometimes we don't need to hear the description (for instance, every Paolini mentions the dragon, he makes a point of saying something about her blue scales, or her neck spikes).Another problem that I had with the book is the mentor at each point in the story. While most fantasy writers have a cluster of characters around the protagonist to teach him or her for the duration of the book, Paolini instead opts to have Eragon with only one or two other people (like Brom, the original companion, or Murtagh, someone who saved him and Brom while being attacked), and his dragon (if not physically present, telepathically communicating with the dragon). I like the consistency of the Hobbit (Gandalf is always there, except for a few small occurences where he must return something or another) and Harry Potter (where teachers, Hagrid and Dumbledore are always guiding him).In this review, I compared Harry Potter and the Hobbit with this book, which, in thinking back on it, wasn't a great idea. A book this good shouldn't be compared to others who have already proven their success. Eragon is one of the best books I have ever read, and I'm sure many will agree."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Christoper Paolini graduated from high school at the age of 15 and in my opinion he should have waited a good deal longer to write Eragon. See, Eragon is not that bad of a idea just poorly executed. The writing falls flat on all facets and in my opinion cant compete with the likes of Robert Jordan, CS Lewis, and even JK Rowling. Considering how many people dislike his book I would not be suprised to find his next book, Eldest to be a real jaw dropper. Critiscm only makes you stronger and Paolini is gonna need alot of it to succeed in this biz. All told Eragon is Poor, unorginal with flat bordering on boring writing. If your new to the genre or 14 and younger I could reccomend it (but I wont). Bottom Line: Wait and see how Eldest is before you try Eragon."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This was a okay start to a new trilogy. It had some flaws but it also had some good things happening. I thought it was better written than most new fantasy books i've tried. The characters were okay, it had a decent plot, enough mystery to keep the target audience which is about 10-14 entertained, and it had action, fighting, and magic.now the only downsides is that I think a lot of the back story was told too much, some things seemed to come a bit too easily to the main character (Like why did he have to turn into a master swords man as well as a very talented magician)? I think it would have been nice if the character had more flaws than plain old ignorance and youth. yes some of the plot elements come straight from many fantasy novels...but I don't think the author did a bad job of putting together an exciting story to read.My main complaint was that the main character reminded me too much of Weasley Crusher from Star Trek: The Next Generation.Other than that I think the story is OK for younger audiences."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I choose book because I enjoy books that have adventure and magic.

Few day later they save an elf from inside the castle. Now it's a new quest. Stop an evil king!

Eragon is one of them. It is about dragons, dwarves, elves, urgals, a group of evil people called the Ra'zac, and magic wielders called Shades.It is about a young boy named Eragon at the age of fifteen who finds a beautiful and marvelous sapphire blue stone that turns out to be a dragon egg. It appears to be an extinct species of dragons. He names her Saphira. Eragon finds out that he is the last of the Dragon Riders, a group of humans or elves that have dragons and wield magic they use to fight urgals, the Ra'zac, Shades, and the evil king Galbatorix.I think that this is a really great book to read. I suggest this book for ages 10 to 12. . This book also is sort of like The Lord of the Rings. In the book Christopher gives you a map to see where Eragon is. The book is also like Tolkien. He also tells you a lot of detailslike what the characters look like and he also tells you about the urgals, Shades, andRa'zac.If you like fantasy books or just to like read long books I recommend this book to you.

He was inspired by Beowolf and the Illiad.

However, it's not all that bad either. As a fantasy reader and writer myself, I quite enjoyed this unique piece of fantasy, but did find several flaws.It is very obvious that the writer is a big fan of LOTR and Star Wars because their influence (and that of many others) can be found in many numerous places. Some may find this disappointing, but I would not go so far. True, this book is lacking in experienced writing skills and that the author should look at getting a new publisher, but it kept me interested and intertained the whole way through. SOmetimes it was even difficult to put down, because even though the general outcome is easy to predict, the details were uncertain and sometimes surprising.I would recommend this to anyone who would not be insulted by some of the pieces taken from other works of literature. However, if you don't mind and enjoy a good read I highly suggest taking a look into this unusual read."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I am a big fan of Tolkien, and Terry Brooks, and this fits right up there with them.

Even for a young adult book, its only about medium deep to how much depth it could really have.

Brom warns the duo that they will soon have to make the choice weather to join King Galbatorix or fight against him with the Varden.I really enjoyed reading Eragon and was interested to know it was written by a teenager, which I thought was really cool.

So, I am not able to compare Eragon to other books.However, I have played few video games myself. I can say that the plot of Eragon has a strong resemblance to the story line of many RPGs (Role Playing Game).In Fact, reading Eragon is like reading a RPG walkthrough. A classic RPG is usually setup like this; the main 'character - usually a young boy and his sidekicks will travel to a town, talk to few people, explore the town, complete a mission then travel to next town or a location and complete more missions.And in a RPG, it is typical for the main character only has the ability to walk around at the beginning of the game then main character will gain a ground transportation once he leaves his hometown. In the last part of the game, main character will finally team up with a flying device.So Many readers questioned why Eragon won't just ride the dragon and flying around?Eragon could not! because it is against the RPG rule!I think somebody should make Eragon into a video game. Ho~ wait they did make Eragon into a vedio game. Why bother reading the book? just play the game.Or even better, just read the walkthrough of the Eragon game. At least there are some interesting pictures to look at in the walkthrough."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"SPOILER ALERT! Don't watch Star Wars before reading this novel, it'll ruin the whole plot! Oh yeah, everyone in the world already did. So we should all know the story, right? Young boy, grows up on a farm with his uncle, meets old hermit who teaches him about his destiny which is to revive an extinct order of peace keepers. Then the evil empire comes to get him and kills his uncle forcing the boy to leave with the hermit and flee across the empire to the secret rebel base. Hermit dyes along the way in one of the imperial bases on a mission to rescue the princess and forces the boy to travel without a mentor. The boy is tracked to the rebel base picking up a rogue companion along the way and a tremendous battle ensues resulting in the rebellions first real victory. That's book one AKA episode 4. I wont get all the way into book two but Oromis=Yoda and \\"Erigon (add ventalatory breath) I am your brother\\"...come on now. I shall not be reading the third book as I'm pretty sure I already know how it ends. How is this guy famous? Why do people read this poorly written dribble? it's just one stolen idea after the next. Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, Dragon Riders of Pern, ect, ect. If anyone can tell me one original idea this man has had, I would love to hear it.P.S. The whole magic, power of words concept is stolen too."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"The plot of this book is the classic coming-of-age story (with dragons, albeit) that one sees in works such as Harry Potter and Star Wars. You can basically cross out the character names from synopses of those and replace them with the character names from Eragon. The story line is classic, but this book doesn't even bring any interesting twists to it.The characters are archetypes, with no personality quirks that would have made them actually interesting.If the author was given an assignment to write a book based on this classic story type, this would have been an admirable response. As it is, it's mind-numbingly boring. It's amazing for a book written by a fifteen-year-old, but it's still not very interesting."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"No matter what others said, I like Eragon (Inheritance Cycle). I know it sounds like star wars and lord of the rings, but well, I like them both so no surprise I like this one too. Good start for a series, good pace and nice story. Hope the next ones in the series keep to be this good."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"When I was a little kid, I started and read this book, and I found it quite good, then I read decent fantasy novels. This book is so immensity long winded that if you cut it down to important details, it would have been maybe thirty pages. In addition to having a paper thin plot that anyone could guess the \\"twists\\" the author blatantly rips off other authors and works as opposed to creating his own ideas. The ancient language is Latin and dwarves speak german! Urgales are simply orcs. All of the characters are shallow and make nothing but one terrible decision after another. Also, the magic users in this book are super weak and whinny \\"oh, I can't heal him easily, it a paper cut, better draw on my magic reserves!\\" seriously, this book is nearly as bad as Harry Potter. Don't waste your time on this book if you can read above a third grade level."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I am writing this as I wait with little anticipation for the final book of the inheritance. I agree with some of the other reviews that this book is just too similar to many of the other dragon/middle earth type fantasies. On the other hand, if you like that kind of thing, that isn't much of a deterrent.My biggest issue has been that while the first book was good enough and easy to plow through, the second one was a little drier and the third was an endless dragging on of every mundane detail. It does include the full saga of a revolution which of course entails more than a one-battle victory, but Paolini might as well tell you everytime Eragon sneezes or picks dirt from his fingernails in between. You can't fault him for leaving anything out, but I found myself glazing over, waiting for the plot to pick up again. In addition, the writing itself is not challenging, but then I believe its only intended as entertainment. I don't think that there are too many characters or places to follow (especially with a map insert to follow for fun), but I do feel that most of the characters are underdeveloped. Unfortunately, Eragon is the worst. Three books in and I am still waiting for a personality to emerge. On the converse, I suppose it is a device well recognized in anime illustration, where the main character is a nondescript as possible to encourage the reader/viewer to relate. I just wish he was more of an inspiration, role model or hero.All that being said, the first book is not bad. The plot is interesting enough and I don't know too many young readers who could read it and not imagine what it would be like to be that special kid selected by destiny to be a great dragon rider. If this is your genre, go ahead, pick this book up, but do so in a paperback. I'm afraid this one falls a bit short of becoming a timeless classic."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I liked this book a lot, it really managed to get me hooked.

Yes, many parts in the book seem to resemble Star Wars and LOTR."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"The prose may be obnoxious when you read it, but when you listen to an audiobook of the story, you really start to have respect for Paolini and his endeavors with words. While some of it drags on, the storyline is reasonably paced. The characters are two-dimensional and flat, but the action-packed storyline helps to alleviate this crime.Overall, I enjoyed it. I would have given it a 3 or 2 had I not listened to the book on audio-tape. However, having done that, I have more respect for the detail in this book."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I enjoyed Eragon for the most part. I devored it in about two and a half days. I'll start with the good things I think. First off the detail in Eragon is wonderful. There are several interesting characters, none of which unfortunatly is the main character. Eragon himself is the most boring character out of all the characters, except for those who have one line. The characters around Eragon are more interesting especially, Brom (though his past was easily predicted), Murtagh, Solembum(I want to see more of him), and Saphira(who is the only reason Eragon is alive). I would like Angela more, but her dialogue seems very forced, though she could become more interesting if she were in it longer. So really the saving grace of Eragon are the details of the landscape and the supporting characters.Now for the bad parts of the book. The biggest fault in Eragon is the plot. Though children will love it, especially if they are too young to read LORT. The plot has one cliche after another countinuously. Some parts suprised me, but not enough to actually really surprise me. Basically I thought of two plot devices he would use and picked the more obvious one and well he picked the other one. The world itself doesn't have any new fantastical creatures or rare ones, like Harry Potter. I hope the series will save itself. The author was 15 when he wrote it so maybe now that he's older Eldest will be better. Yeah I'm a little behind because i thought this series would be horrible. Maybe thats why I loved it, it was better then I thought it could be.Abother bad thing is Eragon. He's too much like all the other heros we've seen. Though he is not as annoying as some. Perhaps in Eldest he will have more character development, but I don't see how.To summarize- It was good enough for me to want to read the next one, but way to flawed plot wise to be considered a classic."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Eragon is not too bad a book, but it is not all that great either. The message is, if you are connected to a good publishing company, it does not matter what quality of story you write, it can be a hit. People are craving good fantasy, and there is precious little of it out there. Eragon, which is marketed to the younger age, is a poor book, because it is a copy of another book, Star Wars A New Hope.Basically, the story is that of an abandoned child (the \\"main\\") who does not know his parents, who is sent to live far away from the \\"evil empire.\\" The \\"king\\" of the \\"evil empire\\" used to be a good guy, a \\"dragon rider\\" and now destroyed the order of \\"dragon riders\\" to take over the world on his own. The opening scene is that of a \\"princess\\" fleeing agents of the \\"evil empire.\\" The \\"princess\\" has a \\"important item for saving the rebels\\" in her possession (this time a dragon egg) which she safely gets away while getting herself captured. The \\"main\\" then gets the \\"important item\\" not knowing what it was. The story progresses so that the \\"main\\" seeks out the \\"wise old man\\" to find out what his special destiny is because of the actions of the \\"special item.\\" Both \\"wise old man\\" and the \\"main\\" find agents of the \\"evil empire\\" have killed his uncle! \\"Wise old man\\" and the \\"main\\" must flee his hiding place now, because they are no longer safe. They wish to find the \\"rebel base.\\" On their way to the rebel base, the \\"wise old man\\" and the \\"main\\" are attacked by agents of the \\"evil empire.\\" Also on the journey the \\"main\\" discovers he has \\"magic.\\" The \\"main\\" realizes that the \\"evil empire\\" has captured the \\"princess\\" and he must save her! The \\"wise old man\\" doesn't think this is wise, and temporarily leaves the scene. The \\"main\\" saves the \\"princess\\" barely, and the \\"wise old man\\" is killed defending their escape. The \\"main\\" and the \\"princess\\" make it to the \\"rebel base\\" with the help of the \\"rogue.\\" The rebel base is attacked by agents of the \\"evil empire\\" and the rebels fight back and destroy the captor of the princess.Now substitute jedi for dragon rider, and you can figure out the rest of the story. Now, if you are a kid and enjoyed this book, might I recommend reading the original story in George Lucas' book called Star Wars. It is the only one he has written, and not an adaptation of the other screen plays. I don't really think Star Wars was that great either, but it had some good elements in it, even though the story needed more development. This story is the exact same one, and it needed more development too. But, hey, the kid is just 17! And, getting all this attention is certain to make him believe he can do no wrong, and therefore take no advice from people, and therefore probably ruin his talent. This kid is no prodigy, but he might have SOME talent. It would have been easier to tell if he had written something original. Instead, it is a pure fantasy adaptation of the most popular sci-fi-fantasy movie of all time.

He's got a terrific writing future--and a long one, if his age is any indicator! But make no mistake about it, this isn't just a great story &quot;for his age&quot;; it's a great story, period. Humans, dragons, elves, dwarves, Shades--yes, all the creatures of fantasy that we love, and then some. You've read that it compares to &quot;Lord of the Rings,&quot; and it certainly does. It has the wide and varied age-appeal that marks Tolkien's masterpieces. I'll happily mount this at the top of my sci-fi fantasy favorites, along with Tolkien, McCaffrey, Lackey, Rowling and a very few others. Can't wait for the next installment, &quot;Eldest.&quot;"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I love Harry Potter Books and a lot more other teen novels such as the Bronze Bow. However, this book is very dull and I agree with others who say it is a rip off from other novels. I have read five chapters and I am, not sure if I want to go on. This was said to be as good as harry potter but I think it is very poor work."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Eragon is a peasant boy ( in the world of Alagaesia )who stumbles across a mysterious blue stone while hunting. Unbeknownst to him, the stone is a dragon egg, and the dragon inside is about to draw him away on a difficult adventure. .The book shows the rough edges of a beggining writer, and follows the generally accepted format familiar to fantasy readers, but it has a depth and enchanting freshness that promises great things to come."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"So what if it draws settings from J.R.R. Tolkien, themes from Anne McCaffrey, and plot from George Lucas and Frank Herbert?That's actually one of the things I liked about this book, besides the fact that Christopher Paolini can tell an excellent story!Here we come across vivid depictions of mountains, woodlands, deserts, and rivers,and travels through them.No boring Terry Brooks-like travelogue here!Eragon finds a mysterious polished blue stone in the forest. He thinks he can sell it to earn money to buy food for his family, but a sleazy butcher named SloanMy favorite character of all was Angela the witch. You've got to see her slay seventeen Urgals with her double-bladed sword, ala Darth Maul's lightsaber! And I want to find out more about her werecat.A lot of names of the places in Carvahall, I noticed, were tributes to characters from Star Trek:Deep Space 9, which I found as incredibly funny in-jokes.The ending kept me waiting for the next installment in the series! I want to find out more about Brom's ring and about Eragon's fate!Keep up the good work, Mr. Paolini!"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"If anything, this book could easily be described as impressive. Just the right amount of familiar fantasy framework, making characters easy to identify with, and original ideas of magic and racial nuances, that keeps the book fresh. This makes for a great read from young adults on up."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"I purchased this relatively unknown book due, in part, to the positive reviews on Amazon. I was misled. As an avid reader, this book was underdeveloped and poorly written. The numerous typos are distracting and the characters lack depth. I forced myself to read the book, hoping it would improve but it did not. Save your money do not buy this book."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"For anyone who is interested in fantasy at all, this book should be required reading. I actually met the author at my local Hastings bookstore, and spoke with him for quite some time. Not only is he really great in person, but his first book is incredible. His writing style is a mix of Dragonlance's Weiss and Hickman, and Dune's Herbert. I am very impressed to see a new writer come out with such a strong beginning. I will anxiously await the continuation of Eragon's adventures, and I am sure that I will be just as impressed with the next book. Rarely do I feel as if I am 'living' the story of a book, but from the time you begin this book, you are sure to feel the pains and successes of Eragon and his companions. Bravo Christopher!! Please keep it up."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"If you are a lover of fantasy novels, then you'll love this book. Christopher Paolini did a wonderful job describing the surroundings and the people. Eragon was easy to follow, but exciting all the way to the end. Several twists and turns kept the story alive. I highly suggest you read this book."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"An excellent read. I was sceptical when I heard Christopher wrote this book between the ages of 15 and 18 but was very impressed. This kid has a real talent for story telling. Can't wait to the sequel.Thanks Christopher"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"How to make Eragon:Get the plot/characters/style from a bunch of brilliant books and moviesSeparate the good things from the badDispose of all the good qualitiesMix all that's left (aka crap) in a panThrow in some ridiculous-sounding made-up wordsAdd LOTS of plot holes (a HUGE empire that controls a whole continent can't catch a kid with an overgrown, annoying lizard?)Heat at 350 degress for three hours or until everything remotely decent has drained awayPublishCongrats! You've made Eragon!(I really did want to like Eragon... but my friends can write MUCH better things than this monstrosity in twenty minutes!)"},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"This book and its author bothers me for the following reasons:1) Just because he wrote this when he 15 does NOT automatically make this a great book2) For the record, it ISN'T a great book.3) The story is derivative4) Of Tolkien5) And God knows how many other fantasy novels6) It's sappy7) It's unengaging8) You can tell it was written by a 15-year-old9) The Editing is horrible!

Oh right...HIS PARENTS)10) Frankly, I think it's a waste of paperOn the other hand, the title page art is lovely."},{"Title":"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.","review":"Not another \\"this is a children's book, so don't criticize it\\" reviewer. Wendelin Van Fan, here's some stuff for you.Wendelin said that criticizing Eragon is like \\"13 year olds criticizing Berenstein Bears.\\" First off, how do you know the ages of the reviewers? Many of them are in fact \\"young adults\\". I'm sixteen and I know a crappy, cliched book when I see it.Second, Paolini obviously didn't mean for Eragon to be as immature as you think it is. His own website shows his pretentiousness in quotes like \\"I strive for a lyrical beauty somewhere between Tolkien at his best and Seamus Heaney's translation of Beowulf.\\" He's comparing his own work to established classics, so why shouldn't we do the same? Face it. Eragon's not a decent children's book. It's a poorly written adult book and anyone, no matter how old he or she is, has the right to criticize it."}]`),A={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:O},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:N,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},R={class:"card-container"},H=["disabled"],B={key:0},C={key:1};function S(n,o,s,u,r,i){const g=y("PoemCard");return e(),t("section",null,[o[1]||(o[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),a("div",R,[(e(!0),t(w,null,f(i.visiblePoems,(h,c)=>(e(),m(g,{key:c,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(e(),t("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:o[0]||(o[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(e(),t("span",C,"Loading...")):(e(),t("span",B,"See more"))],8,H)):b("",!0)])}const G=d(A,[["render",S],["__scopeId","data-v-9a7aa001"]]),K=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"guide/52.md","filePath":"guide/52.md"}'),P={name:"guide/52.md"},j=Object.assign(P,{setup(n){return(o,s)=>(e(),t("div",null,[p(G)]))}});export{K as __pageData,j as default};
