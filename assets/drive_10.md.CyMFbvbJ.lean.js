How, then, did I come to be walking this ancient path, family and friends left behind, and everything I owned in a pack on my back? Exchanging my office pumps for hiking boots and my purse for a backpack, for forty days I followed the Camino de Santiago, a historic pilgrimage of almost eight hundred kilometres across northern Spain. During my journey to Santiago, I experienced climbs and descents that challenged my endurance, ancient towns and historical landmarks that excited my imagination, and endless plains and stretches of solitude that tested my soul. I bent against blinding snow and pummeling winds, endured drenching rains, and basked in brilliant sunshine. My steps led over rocky trails, through whispering forests, among dancing grasslands, and through bustling cosmopolitan cities and crumbling towns. A colourful, international cast of characters strolled through my days, from an irreverent Irishman, to a Polish political prisoner, to a young German couple packing their new baby, to a Tennessee twosome that was walking the world. Their stories were as varied as the landscapes through which we passed. Some sought spiritual renewal, some walked to exercise grief, and some in hope or gratitude for personal miracles. Others just enjoyed walking, seeing a new country, and meeting new people. Each experienced their own Camino in their own way. Ordinary people living ordinary lives, suddenly stepping out on an extraordinary journey, we shared food, wine, and bunk rooms. Through laughter and tears, we broke down barriers of language, religion, and nationality. Strangers became friends, and friends became family, some just for a day or two . . . and some for a lifetime.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=bXpgDwAAQBAJ&dq=To+Each+Their+Own&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"2005 Calendar of Unfortunate Events: Thirteen Alarming Months!

Edited and introduced by noted anarchist scholar Robert Graham, the collection will include the definitive texts from the anarchist tradition of political thought, beginning with some of the earliest writings from China and Europe against feudal servitude and authority. The collection will then go on to document the best of the anti-authoritarian writings from the English and French Revolutions and the early development of libertarian socialist ideas, including such writers as Gerrard Winstanley, William Godwin, Charles Fourier, Max Stirner, as well as the early anarchist writings of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, Michael Bakunin, Peter Kropotkin, Errico Malatesta, Elisee Reclus, Leo Tolstoy, and Emma Goldman. This incomparable volume deals both with the positive ideas and proposals the anarchists tried to put into practice, and with the anarchist critiques of the authoritarian theories and practices confronting them during these years with their revolutionary upheavals. Robert Graham has written extensively on the history of anarchist ideas. He is the author of  The Role of Contract in Anarchist Ideology,  in the Routledge publication, For Anarchism, edited by David Goodway, and he wrote the introduction to the 1989 Pluto Press edition of Proudhon's General Idea of the Revolution in the 19th Century, originally published in 1851.

In the meantime, her work as a suburban Chicago homicide detective has taken her back in time in another way, to a group of children she once counseled, each now four years older and with four more year's worth of problems. There's LaShawna, now seventeen and with her own four-year-old daughter; Padgett, all grown up at twelve but still living with his alcoholic mother; and then Jose, fifteen, who's in the most trouble of them all. He's been accused of murder, but the Jose that Marti remembers could not have committed such a terrible crime. Her first step is to find out what could have happened in the past four years to lead Jose to such a desperate act, and she hopes her second step will be to prove his innocence. It won't be easy, though; just what's going on with this tight group of kids, and how does it relate to the increasingly foreboding sense of doom Marti gets about the mystery man who's nosing around the remnants of her distant past? She's not sure, but she knows she must figure it all out, and soon, before another of the children, or even Marti herself, falls into grave danger.

Washington advocated vocational training, while W. E. B. Du Bois stressed the importance of the liberal arts. Into the fray stepped Nathan B. Young, who, as Antonio Holland now tells, left a lasting mark on that debate. Born in slavery in Alabama, Young followed a love of learning to degrees from Talladega and Oberlin Colleges and a career in higher education. Employed by Booker T. Washington in 1892, he served at Tuskegee Institute until conflict with Washington's vocational orientation led him to move on. During a brief tenure at Georgia State Industrial College under Richard R. Wright, Sr., he became disillusioned by efforts of whites to limit black education to agriculture and the trades. Hired as president of Florida A&M in 1901, he fought for twenty years to balance agricultural/vocational education with the liberal arts, only to meet with opposition from state officials that led to his ouster. This principled educator finally found his place as president of Lincoln University in Missouri in 1923. Here Young made a determined effort to establish the school as a standard institution of higher learning. Holland describes how he campaigned successfully to raise academic standards and gain accreditation for Lincoln's programs-successes made possible by the political and economic support of farsighted members of Missouri's black community. Holland shows that the great debate over black higher education was carried on not only in the rhetoric of Washington and Du Bois but also on the campuses, as Young and others sought to prepare African American students to become thinkers and creators. In tracing Young's career, Holland presents a wealth of information on the nature of the education provided for former slaves and their descendents in four states-shedding new light on the educational environment at Oberlin and Tuskegee-and on the actions of racist white government officials to limit the curriculum of public education for blacks. Although Young's efforts to improve the schools he served were often thwarted, Holland shows that he kept his vision alive in the black community. Holland's meticulous reconstruction of an eventful career provides an important look at the forces that shaped and confounded the development of black higher education during traumatic times.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Usa-_VgFkrgC&dq=Young+Nathan&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How to Live Forever","description":"1904 the science and practice.

Jansenism, and the theology of Cornelius Jansen, powerfully infused French political life from the mid seventeenth century to the Revolution 150 years later - it impacted on the Enlightenment, the development of French constitutional thinking, the modernisation of the Catholic church and the destruction of the Jesuits. William Doyle has written an invaluable book. It explains exactly why Jansenism was so important, it recreates the religious and intellectual world which fostered it and examines the critical issues, such as the all-pervasive role of the Jesuits in European Catholic life. Anyone armed with this concise, straightforward book will find themselves immeasurably better prepared to understand the mentality both of France and much of Enlightenment Europe before the cataclysm of 1789.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=hY2vswEACAAJ&dq=Jansenism:+Catholic+Resistance+to+Authority+from+the+Reformation+to+the+French+Revolution+(Studies+in+European+History)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Elizabeth & Leicester (Phoenix Press)","description":"A magnificent tribute to the life and reign of Queen Elizabeth II, Britain's longest reigning monarch, and a celebration of the British royal family.

The authors begin with a general essay based on recent scholarship in Arabic, Romance, and ethnomusicological studies and then present a translation of Al-Tifashi's key 13th-century Arabic treatise on the musical tradition of Arab Spain. The appendices provide texts and translations of ten poems that modern scholarship attributes to or authenticates as part of the Hispano-Arabic song repertory, and musical notations of these texts as sung in Arab countries today. The authors suggest that the living tradition of Andalusian music surviving in the Arab world preserves a priceless echo, be it ever so distorted, of the lost tradition of Hispano-Arabic songs. They conclude that this tradition was a subtle blending of imported Oriental elements combined with others native to the Romance-singing Iberian Peninsula.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=KWw4rVOdbagC&dq=Ten+Hispano-Arabic+Strophic+Songs+in+the+Modern+Oral+Tradition:+Music+and+Texts+(UC+Publications+in+Modern+Philology)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Coping With Toxic Managers, Subordinates ... and Other Difficult People: Using Emotional Intelligence To Survive and Prosper (Financial Times Prentice Hall Books)","description":"The author shows how to use emotional intelligence tactics to survive when dealing with toxic managers and other impossible people in the workplace.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=EQD_duR6sgMC&dq=Coping+With+Toxic+Managers,+Subordinates+...+and+Other+Difficult+People:+Using+Emotional+Intelligence+To+Survive+and+Prosper+(Financial+Times+Prentice+Hall+Books)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Halloween Honeymoon (Silhouette Desire, No. 1030)","description":"The Mercenary And The New Mom by Merline Lovelace released on Dec 25, 1998 is available now for purchase.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=suAHKMc2kb8C&dq=Halloween+Honeymoon+(Silhouette+Desire,+No.+1030)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Best of Byerly's: A Recipe Collection- From the Test Kitchen of Byerly's Home Economists","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=QpZaQAAACAAJ&dq=The+Best+of+Byerly%27s:+A+Recipe+Collection-+From+the+Test+Kitchen+of+Byerly%27s+Home+Economists&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"CliffsTestPrep NCLEX-RN","description":"The CliffsTestPrep series offers full-length practice exams that simulate the real tests; proven test-taking strategies to increase your chances at doing well; and thorough review exercises to help fill in any knowledge gaps.

Sixty thousand copies in print! In her bestselling 1990 book, Sally Helgesen discovered that men and women approach work in fundamentally different ways. Many of these differences hold distinct advantages for women, who excel at running organizations that foster creativity, cooperation, and intuitive decision-making power, necessities for companies of the twenty-first century. Helgesen's findings reveal that organizations run by women do not take the form of the traditional hierarchical pyranaid, but more closely resemble a web, where leaders reach out, not down, to form an interrelating matrix built around a central purpose. The strategy of the web concentrates power at the center by drawing others closer and by creating communities where information sharing is essential. She presents her findings through unique, closely detailed accounts of four successful women business leaders -- Frances Hesselbein of Girl Scouts USA, Barbara Grogan of Western Industrial Contractors, Nancy Badore of Ford Motor Company's Executive Development Center, and Dorothy Brunson of Brunson Communications. Helgesen observes their meetings, listens to their phone calls and conferences, and reads their correspondence. Her \\"diary studies\\" document how women leaders make decisions, schedule their days, gather and disperse information, motivate others, delegate tasks, structure their companies, hire, and fire. She chronicles how their experiences as women -- wives, mothers, friends, sisters, daughters -- contribute to their leadership style.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jQbdx7V7sFEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"After the Gate Bangs Shut","description":"Fourteen year-old Jackie Brooks seeks to escape the horrors of his home life for one of independence on the streets.

This acclaimed biography, newly revised and completely updated, tells the remarkable story of Hans Fallada, whose real name was Rudolf Ditzen. Jenny Williams chronicles his turbulent life as a writer, husband and father, shadowed by mental torment and long periods in psychiatric care. She shows how Ditzen's decision to remain in Nazi Germany in 1939 led to his self-destruction, but also made him a unique witness to his country's turmoil. More Lives Than One unpicks the contradictory, flawed and fascinating life of a writer who saw the worst of humanity, yet maintained his belief in the decency of the 'little man'.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0_XyWMPg8SMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Some answered questions","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=vPekAQAACAAJ&dq=Some+answered+questions&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mansions of Madness (Call of Cthulhu Horror Roleplaying, 1920s Era)","description":"[CALL OF CTHULHU ROLEPLAYING] In dim, forgotten recesses of the world lurk mind-twisting horrors. Through the use of human agents these horrors work to thwart mankind's destiny. However, not all of these human agents are willing partners. Many times have the monsters resorted to subtlety and intrigue to further their ends, rather than gross displays of sheer destruction. Andrew Keetling is one such unwilling agent. A sucessful Boston businessman, he has disappeared -- held captive in a mansion of madness. MANSIONS OF MADNESS is a collection of six independent tales for \\"Call of Cthulhu.\\" Set in the 1920s and of varying length and complexity, these adventures can be planted into an ongoing campaign as the keeper sees fit. Some can be played in a single night, others will require several evenings to complete. They can readily be used as plot twists, interesting diversions, or red herrings.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ZM4PGQAACAAJ&dq=Mansions+of+Madness+(Call+of+Cthulhu+Horror+Roleplaying,+1920s+Era)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Megabrain","description":"The classic book that revolutionized the \\"mind tech\\" industry is finally available in low cost Kindle edition. Scientists have learned more about the brain in the last decade than in all of previous history, and the implications of the latest research are clear: The human brain is far more powerful, and has the potential for immensely greater growth and transformation, than was ever before imagined. These discoveries may constitute the most significant development in learning since the invention of writing. Michael Hutchison captures all the drama, excitement, and adventure as we finally begin to comprehend the most mysterious and complex structure in the universe, the source of human culture, a still untapped reservoir of power and skills. He looks at the recently developed machines and devices that may soon allow us to increase brain size and intelligence; regenerate brain cells; trigger specific brain states such as euphoria, long- and short-term memory, sexual excitement, and creativity; and control the brain's electrical activity in order to alter such \\"involuntary\\" mechanisms as blood pressure, heart rate, and the secretion of hormones. Megabrain is a lucid and lively account of where the pioneers in brain research are headed -- and where they are taking us.

I had heart disease.   from Take It to Heart Nobody lived a healthier or more active life. She was the juicing guru to the stars. She exercised and ate right. But at forty-seven Pamela Serure, exhausted, in pain, and with diagnoses ranging from menopause to anxiety, discovered that she had heart disease. Lifestyle and diet couldn t correct what her genes had determined. With two days to get her affairs in order, Pamela prepared for triple bypass surgery to correct three almost completely clogged arteries. What the doctors missed and what most women don t seem to know is that heart disease is the number-one killer of American women. It kills more women than all the cancers combined. Traditional markers of heart disease, such as high cholesterol, may not apply to women. As a result, doctors consistently misdiagnose female patients with anxiety, digestive distress, or symptoms of menopause. Blindsided by her sudden bypass surgery, Pamela Serure turned her life-altering experience into a personal mission to help educate other women about this dangerous and far-reaching disease. In this book Pamela opens the door to her recovery process and tells readers what the doctors won t. She has found experts to offer advice so that readers will know exactly what to look for and what tests to demand. Women share stories of how they persisted in having the cardiac tests run that saved their lives and others share stories of women they lost because of a missed diagnosis. Comforting, funny, and soulful, this is the book that will empower women to take charge of their heart health. As Pamela says,  These days heart disease has all my attention, as it should have yours.

Here, in the late 1960s, a young Colombian development worker named Paolo Lugari wondered if the nearly uninhabited, infertile llanos could be made livable for his country s growing population. He had no idea that nearly four decades later, his experiment would be one of the world s most celebrated examples of sustainable living: a permanent village called Gaviotas. In the absence of infrastructure, the first Gaviotans invented wind turbines to convert mild breezes into energy, hand pumps capable of tapping deep sources of water, and solar collectors efficient enough to heat and even sterilize drinking water under perennially cloudy llano skies. Over time, the Gaviotans  experimentation has even restored an ecosystem: in the shelter of two million Caribbean pines planted as a source of renewable commercial resin, a primordial rain forest that once covered the llanos is unexpectedly reestablishing itself. Colombian author Gabriel Garc a M rquez has called Paolo Lugari  Inventor of the World.  Lugari himself has said that Gaviotas is not a utopia:  Utopia literally means  no place.  We call Gaviotas a topia, because it s real.  Relive their story with this special 10th-anniversary edition of Gaviotas, complete with a new afterword by the author describing how Gaviotas has survived and progressed over the past decade.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vWR_LQys4hsC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How to Draft Basic Patterns (4th Edition)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=P1DGQgAACAAJ&dq=How+to+Draft+Basic+Patterns+(4th+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Garry Kasparov on Fischer: Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors, Part 4","description":"This book brings together the two greatest names in the history of chess. The author, Garry Kasparov, is the world number one and, by common consent, the greatest player ever. The subject of the book, Bobby Fischer, is the only American to have become world champion and is probably the greatest natural talent the world has ever seen.In the period between 1955 and 1972 Fischer, more or less single-handedly, took on the might of the Soviet Chess Empire, and won. During this time Fischer scored astonishing successes the like of which had not been seen before. These included 11/11 in the 1963/64 US Championship and match victories (en route to the World Championship) by the score of 6-0 against two of the strongest players in the world, Mark Taimanov and Bent Larsen. The climax of Fischer's campaign was his unforgettable match win in Reykjavik in 1972 against Boris Spassky. Fischer is almost equally well-known for his temperamental behaviour away from the board, as his play on it. He made extreme demands of all those around him including tournament organisers. When these demands were not met he often refused to play. The 1972 match against Spassky required the intervention of no less than Henry Kissinger to smooth things over. In 1975 when he was due to defend his title against Anatoly Karpov, Fischer was completely unable to agree terms with FIDE (the World Chess Federation) and was defaulted. After this he more or less gave up chess, playing only once, a 'return' match against Spassky in 1992. In this book, a must for all serious chessplayers, Kasparov analyses deeply Fischer's greatest games and assesses the legacy of this great American genius.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=zvqkxQEACAAJ&dq=Garry+Kasparov+on+Fischer:+Garry+Kasparov+on+My+Great+Predecessors,+Part+4&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Concise History of Modern Painting","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=LMBJAQAAIAAJ&dq=A+Concise+History+of+Modern+Painting&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Hot Sands of Hell","description":"The author centres his novel on an extraordinary desert flight from the Afrika Corps during the fall of Tobruk during World War II.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=8pnzvQEACAAJ&dq=The+Hot+Sands+of+Hell&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Making Friends: Training Your Dog Positively","description":"An experienced dog trainer presents her method for training dogs based on positive reinforcement","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=cYEbAQAAMAAJ&dq=Making+Friends:+Training+Your+Dog+Positively&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Report on probability A (Doubleday science fiction)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=_aH2wAEACAAJ&dq=Report+on+probability+A+(Doubleday+science+fiction)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"DICTIONARY OF THE HISTORY OF IDEAS: STUDIES OF SELECTED PIVOTAL IDEAS","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=VnqrngEACAAJ&dq=DICTIONARY+OF+THE+HISTORY+OF+IDEAS:+STUDIES+OF+SELECTED+PIVOTAL+IDEAS&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Building Wealth from the Ground Up","description":"\\"Building Wealth from the Ground Up\\" is a strategic real-life approach to climbing out of the basement of debt to finding dollars to build your own financial empire.

Anne Tyler, The New York Times Book Review. A brilliantly panoramic novel spanning a quarter-century of American life, John Gregory Dunne s The Red White and Blue tells the story of California's high-profile Broderick family, a tale beginning in the tumult of the 1960s. The clan includes a billionaire San Francisco patriarch, his sons the celebrity priest and Hollywood screenwriter, and his daughter, wife to the brother of the American president. Rounding out the front-line cast is Leah Kaye, a politically radical lawyer once married to the screenwriter Jack Broderick, an ex-newspaperman and the book's narrator. The influence of wealth in American politics. A California agricultural strike. A South American election. The black-power movement. Hollywood movers and shakers. All of this and more is deftly navigated as Dunne sets his main characters and big-canvas forces in motion. Jack himself is pulled into the swirl, his ironic detachment proving insufficient bulwark against dramas that grow darker, more dangerous and more personal as Dunne s epic unfolds. A robust, bitterly comic portrait of America in the Viet Nam era and after, with a storyline headed towards tragedy, The Red White and Blue   appearing here in digital format for the first time   is John Gregory Dunne at his most ambitious and far-seeing, his gaze sweeping from coast to coast and from decade to American decade.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=QejHCgAAQBAJ&dq=True+Confessions:+A+Novel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Windhaven Plantation","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=wcTkAAAACAAJ&dq=Windhaven+Plantation&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cassell's Colloquial Spanish: A Guide to Everyday Spanish","description":"Over the past 35 years, hundreds of thousands of readers have agreed: This is the classic guide to \\"living, traveling, and taking things as they come\\" in Mexico.

As a Man Thinketh is a literary essay which has been mass-produced since its publication in 1902. It has been a source of inspiration to motivational and self-help authors.The title is influenced by a verse in the Bible from the Book of Proverbs, chapter 23, verse 7:  As a man thinketh in his heart, so is he.  While the passage suggests that one should consider the true motivations of a person who is being uncharacteristically generous before accepting his generosity, the title and content of Allen's work refer to the reader himself.This book, written in terms of the responsibility assumption, opens with the statement: Mind is the Master power that moulds and makes, And Man is Mind, and evermore he takes The tool of Thought, and, shaping what he wills, Brings forth a thousand joys, a thousand ills: He thinks in secret, and it comes to pass: Environment is but his looking-glass.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Lz_3ngEACAAJ&dq=As+a+man+thinketh&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Superfolks","description":"Before there was WATCHMEN, there was SUPERFOLKS....

In Farming on the Wild Side they explain the philosophical and scientific principles that influenced them as they phased out sheep and potatoes and embraced apples, pears, stone fruits, and a wide variety of uncommon berry crops; turned much of their property into a semi-wild state; and adapted their marketing and sales strategies to the new century. As the Haydens pursued their goals of enhancing biodiversity and regenerating their land, they incorporated agroforestry and permaculture principles into perennial fruit polycultures, a pollinator sanctuary, repurposed greenhouses for growing fruit, h gelkultur, and ecological \\"pest\\" management. Beyond the practical techniques and tips, this book also inspires readers to develop greater ecological literacy and respect for the mysteries of the global ecosystem.

This book examines the social and cultural history of the Jewish community in Czechoslovakia from the Age of Enlightenment to the middle of the twentieth century. From family histories, newspaper and magazine articles, wills, and letters, Wilma Iggers has culled descriptions of life, customs, and local color; portrayals of important individuals and families; stories of individuals depicting the transition of a culture and a people from the Middle Ages to modern times; an examination of complaints about the deterioration of the religious communities and of religious instruction; and the history of anti- Semitism. Practically all reports reflect the difficult struggle for survival as Jews. The texts also address special legislation regarding the Jews, industrialization and urbanization, changes in religious and familial structures, growing involvement in the culture and politics of the worldly communities, cultural assimilation, changes in stereotypes about the Jews, and the effects of political forces from outside. The Jews of Bohemia and Moravia begins with the expulsion of the Jews from Prague by Empress Maria Theresa in 1744, an event which caused a shock that remained in the Jewish consciousness for a long time. The book concludes with texts from the middle of the twentieth century dealing with the most recent generation of Bohemian and Moravian Jews. Despite fluctuations and radical breaks, the time span from 1744 to 1952 constitutes a single unit that encompasses striking cultural and economic developments as well as anti-Semitism and cynicism unmatched even in the Middle Ages. With their strong emotional ties to the land of their birth, Bohemian and Moravian Jews are closer to the Central and West Europeans than to the Jews from Eastern Europe. Although Jews are often criticized for adapting themselves easily to other countries--meaning that they have no real roots--their strong emotional ties to their countries of origin are clearly expressed in a number of documents included in this book.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Vm66-SUb6VgC&dq=The+Jews+of+Bohemia+and+Moravia:+A+Historical+Reader&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mustang","description":"De Duitse schrijver Karl May leefde van 1842 tot 1912.

Hij bereikte een ongekende, nog steeds voortdurende populariteit als de schepper van de onsterfelijke prairiehelden Winnetou en Old Shatterhand.

Be it Grandmaster Flash at the Roxy, a summer block party in the Bronx, the fresh faces of Jay-Z and Will Smith, the cocksure personas of Tupac Shakur, The Notorious B.I.G., and Eminem, or the regal grace of Lauryn Hill, Ernie Paniccioli has been there to showcase hiphop s emerging talent. With more than 200 photographs that have been culled from a vast archive, Who Shot Ya? is the first major pictorial history of hiphop culture.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mh_a5QW32o4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"One Summer Night","description":"College professor Johanna Marshall swore she would never fall in love again.

The study of the Orion Nebula, focused upon by ever more powerful telescopes from Galileo's time to our own, clarifies how stars are formed, and how we have come to understand the process. C. Robert O'Dell has spent a lifetime studying Orion, and in this book he explains what the Nebula is, how it shines, its role in giving birth to stars, and the insights it affords into how common (or rare) planet formation might be. An account of astronomy's extended engagement with one remarkable celestial object, this book also tells the story of astronomy over the last four centuries. To help readers appreciate the Nebula and its secrets, O'Dell unfolds his tale chronologically, as astrophysical knowledge developed, and our knowledge of the Nebula and the night sky improved. Because he served as chief scientist for the Hubble Space Telescope, O'Dell conveys a sense of continuity with his professional ancestors as he describes the construction of the world's most powerful observatory. The result is a rare insider's view of this observatory--and, from that unique perspective, an intimate observer's understanding of one of the sky's most instructive and magnificent objects.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=y7tHzwEACAAJ&dq=The+Orion+Nebula:+Where+Stars+Are+Born&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Century of Nature: Twenty-One Discoveries that Changed Science and the World","description":"Many of the scientific breakthroughs of the twentieth century were first reported in the journal Nature.

Douglass' Women reimagines the lives of an American hero, Frederick Douglass, and two women -- his wife and his mistress -- who loved him and lived in his shadow. Anna Douglass, a free woman of color, was Douglass' wife of forty-four years, who bore him five children. Ottilie Assing, a German-Jewish intellectual, provided him the companionship of the mind that he needed. Hurt by Douglass' infidelity, Anna rejected his notion that only literacy freed the mind. For her, familial love rivaled intellectual pursuits. Ottilie was raised by parents who embraced the ideal of free love, but found herself entrapped in an unfulfilling love triangle with America's most famous self-taught slave for nearly three decades. In her finest novel to date, Jewell Parker Rhodes vividly resurrects these two extraordinary women from history, portraying the life they led together under the same roof of the Douglass home. Here, fiery emotions of passion, jealousy, and resentment churn as the women discover an uneasy solidarity in shared love for an exceptional and powerful man. Douglass' Women fills the gaps and silences that history has left in an unforgettable epic full of heartache and triumph.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=IHTup9d6c8gC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Microwave Transistor Amplifiers : Analysis and Design","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Y-AjQwAACAAJ&dq=Microwave+Transistor+Amplifiers+:+Analysis+and+Design&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"To Redeem One Person Is To Redeem The World: A Life of Frieda Fromm-Reichmann","description":"In this marvelously researched and moving biography closely grounded in Frieda Fromm-Reichmann's work, Gail Hornstein brings back to life the maverick psychiatrist who accomplished what Freud and almost everyone else thought impossible: successfully treating schizophrenics and other seriously disturbed mental patients with intensive psychotherapy, not lobotomy, shock treatment, or drugs. To Redeem One Person Is to Redeem the World tells the extraordinary life story of the German-Jewish refugee analyst, who was the first wife of Erich Fromm. Written with unprecedented access to a rich archive of Frieda Fromm-Reichmann's clinical work at the legendary Chestnut Lodge Hospital in Rockville, Maryland, and using newly discovered family records and documents from across Europe and the United States, this is the definitive biography of a remarkable woman. Best known to millions as the courageous therapist in I Never Promised You a Rose Garden, Joanne Greenberg's bestselling chronicle of madness and recovery, Fromm-Reichmann (1889-1957) is a fascinating and controversial figure in twentieth-century psychiatry. To Redeem One Person Is to Redeem the World traces the story of her life and education, from a loving childhood as the eldest of three daughters in an Orthodox Jewish family to medical school at seventeen, as one of the first women admitted to study at a Prussian university. During World War I, Fromm-Reichmann took charge of a military hospital in K?nigsberg, transforming it into a pioneering center for the treatment of brain injury. By her mid-thirties, she had opened her own psychiatric sanitarium in Heidelberg, where she and her staff put into practice a unique and hopeful integration of psychotherapy and tikkun, the Jewish ethical principle that every person is worth saving. At thirty-six, she had an affair with and then married her patient, Erich Fromm, later the celebrated author of Escape from Freedom, The Art of Loving, and other psychological classics. Her close friends and colleagues in pre-World War II Germany included some of the most visionary intellectuals and therapists of the era: Martin Buber, Karen Horney, Franz Rosenzweig, Gershom Scholem, and Georg Groddeck, among others. Hornstein recounts Fromm-Reichmann's dramatic escape from Nazi Germany, exile in France and Palestine, and her flight to the United States, where she found asylum at a tiny hospital outside Washington, D.C. Over the following decades, Fromm-Reichmann would emerge as the most distinguished figure at Chestnut Lodge, a mental hospital unlike any other -- intellectually radical, yet filled with warm family feeling and deeply respectful of individual difference. Fromm-Reichmann was not only pivotal in creating a beacon of hope at Chestnut Lodge, which stood alone as the place where the sickest patients could go to be cured. She was also a maverick in her field -- the only prominent woman analyst of her day to write about schizophrenia, not femininity or children. And she had little interest in the arcane theoretical disputes that obsessed most of her colleagues; curing patients was her consuming goal. As the pendulum swings back from psychiatry's addiction to drugs as the sole treatment for mental illness, Fromm-Reichmann's breadth of vision makes this biography of a heroic, yet all-too-human, woman a timely and compelling work.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NN0_rPu20ysC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"TRANSMUTATION, A Novel about Eternal Love","description":"Ren Eagle is a financial wizard who, at age 39, has become chairman of a powerful financial institution.

He boldly reveals how most of Africa's misfortunes are self-imposed, and why the world must now deal differently with the continent. Here we learn that Africa has steadily lost markets by its own mismanagement, that even capitalist countries are anti-business, that African family values and fatalism are more destructive than tribalism, and that African leaders prey intentionally on Western guilt. Calderisi exposes the shortcomings of foreign aid and debt relief, and proposes his own radical solutions. Drawing on thirty years of first hand experience, The Trouble with Africa highlights issues which have been ignored by Africa's leaders but have worried ordinary Africans, diplomats, academics, business leaders, aid workers, volunteers, and missionaries for a long time. It ripples with stories which only someone who has talked directly to African farmers--and heads of state--could recount. Calderisi's aim is to move beyond the hand-wringing and finger-pointing which dominates most discussions of Africa. Instead, he suggests concrete steps which Africans and the world can take to liberate talent and enterprise on the continent.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=NoIkBQAAQBAJ&dq=The+Trouble+with+Africa:+Why+Foreign+Aid+Isn%27t+Working&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Greek and Latin in Scientific Terminology","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Xd8IAQAAIAAJ&dq=Greek+and+Latin+in+Scientific+Terminology&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How To Make The Devil Obey You!!!","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=gg4MTSH9y1YC&dq=How+To+Make+The+Devil+Obey+You!!!&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Usborne First Encyclopedia of Seas and Oceans","description":"This enclyclopedia introduces young readers to the wonders of the sea.

Through careful examination of primary sources, Lillback builds a large store of evidence for Calvin's covenant thought.

Peter Alan Roberts compares significant episodes in the life of Rechungpa as portrayed in a succession of texts, and thus demonstrates the evolution of Rechungpa's biography. This is the first survey of the surviving literature which includes a detailed analysis of their dates, authorship and interrelationships. It shows how Rechungpa was increasingly portrayed as a rebellious, volatile and difficult pupil, as a lineage from a fellow-pupil prospered to become dominant in Tibet.

Indeed, many lost their lives for their efforts. Those who hid Jews included priests, nurses, teachers, neighbors and friends, employees and colleagues, soldiers and diplomats, and, above all, ordinary citizens. From Greek Orthodox Princess Alice of Greece, who hid Jews in her home in Athens, to the Ukrainian Uniate Archbishop of Lvov, who hid hundreds of Jews in his churches and monasteries, to Muslims in Bosnia and Albania, many risked, and lost, everything to help their fellow man.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1mQBeR9F0isC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The modern corporation and private property","description":"Written more than a half-century ago, The Modern Corporation and Private Property remains the fundamental introduction to the internal organization of the corporation in modern society.

Where Is Catholicism Today? A Collection of Independent Studies","description":"How the Jesuits re-emerged after forty years of suppression In 1773, Pope Clement XIV suppressed the Society of Jesus. For the 823 Jesuits living in the Low Countries, it meant the end of their institutional religious life. In the Austrian Netherlands, the Jesuits were put under strict surveillance, but in the Dutch Republic they were able to continue their missionary work. It is this regional contrast and the opportunities it offered for the Order to survive that make the Low Countries an exceptional and interesting case in Jesuit history. Just as in White Russia, former Jesuits and new Jesuits in the Low Countries prepared for the restoration of the Order, with the help of other religious, priests, and lay benefactors. In 1814, eight days before the restoration of the Society by Pope Pius VII, the novitiate near Ghent opened with eleven candidates from all over the United Netherlands. Barely twenty years later, the Order in the Low Countries  by then counting one hundred members  formed an independent Belgian Province. A separate Dutch Province followed in 1850. Obviously, the reestablishment, with new churches and new colleges, carried a heavy survival burden: in the face of their old enemies and the black legends they revived, the Jesuits had to retrieve their true identity, which had been suppressed for forty years.

The purpose of these volumes (more to follow) is to make sure there is an accurate record of what really happened at the time, so that the facts are not swallowed up by charismatic redacting of history. there is an argument that Pentecostalism is not responsible for the wild antics in the 'Blessing' movement (which has changed names many times), but it is hard to distinguish the two, though some Pentecostals deny any involvement.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=QZ2mDwAAQBAJ&dq=Heavenly+Deceptions:+2&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mapping Mortality: The Persistence of Memory and Melancholy in Early Modern England (Massachusetts Studies in Early Modern Culture)","description":"This book is a cultural study of the ways men and women in early modern England confronted, accommodated, and paid tribute to mortal life and certain death. Drawing on prose and poetry, painting and statuary, social practices and religious rites, William Engel reopens central questions about Renaissance habits of thought. He explores how the metaphorics of that period signaled and enacted a continual revelation of mortality: the death of the body (figured as a kind of vehicle) and the eternality of the soul (that which was to be transported). Engel argues that early modern metaphorics was essentially mnemonic and emblematic, grounding itself in the relation of body and soul. Building on the work of Benjamin, Heidegger, Derrida, Baudrillard, and Eliade, the book provides contemporary readers with a key for recovering and understanding the critical assumptions underlying a mnemonically oriented principle of aesthetics.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=0hFszQEACAAJ&dq=Mapping+Mortality:+The+Persistence+of+Memory+and+Melancholy+in+Early+Modern+England+(Massachusetts+Studies+in+Early+Modern+Culture)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"An Arts and Crafts Journal","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=on5LAAAACAAJ&dq=An+Arts+and+Crafts+Journal&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Siberian Husky: An Owner's Guide toa Happy Healthy Pet","description":"An Owner's Guide to a Happy Healthy Pet is the series to turn to when you want a basic reference that's reliable, up-to-date, and complete.

And soon Pitt's skills and ingenuity are desperately needed to rescue the team after a suspicious explosion seals them deep underground. It quickly becomes clear that the artefacts carry a message: warning of global Armageddon. Yet a shadowy organisation called the Fourth Empire not only wants to stop others from heeding that warning, but is also actively seeking to accelerate the end it foretells.

These essays by historians and political scientists from the United States and abroad focus on six distinct aspects of Madison s life and work: his personality and development as a statesman; his work at the Constitutional Convention of 1787 and contributions to larger constitutional design; his advocacy for the adoption of the Bill of Rights; his controversial role as a party leader; his presidency; and his life after leaving office. James Madison continues to be regarded as one of America s great political theorists, a man who devoted his life to, and who found fulfill- ment in, public service. His philosophical contributions remain vital to any understanding of the modern American polity. This book will be of great interest to political scientists and theorists, as well as to historians of early American history and politics.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=MSYypS4qiMYC&dq=James+Madison,+(American+statesman)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Secret Mission to the Philippines: The Story of \\"Spyron\\" & the American-Filipino Guerrillas of World War II","description":"Describes the unusual World War II command of Chick Parsons who, as leader of the American-Filipino guerrilla movement, lived behind enemy lines, never carried arms or fired a shot, and became one of America's most decorated heroes.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=FKrkAAAAIAAJ&dq=Secret+Mission+to+the+Philippines:+The+Story+of+%22Spyron%22&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"DELIGHTES FOR LADIES.

Opulent tour buses riding through apocalyptic snowstorms and cramped vans that reek of dope and beer. Brilliant performances and heart-sinking break-ups.

In 1996, when the Rheostatics opened for the Tragically Hip on their Trouble at the Henhouse tour, Bidini kept a diary. In On a Cold Road he weaves his colourful tales about that tour with revealing and hilarious anecdotes from the pioneers of Canadian rock - including BTO, Goddo, the Stampeders, Max Webster, Crowbar, the Guess Who, Triumph, Trooper, Bruce Cockburn, Gale Garnett, and Tommy Chong - whom Bidini later interviewed in an effort to compare their experiences with his.

Through his parents, he shows us gifted Christian workers, who willingly faced enormous sacrifices for the Christian cause in early 20th century China. Harris, the Arabic Scholar's Son, offers us a warm look at a family dedicated to living out the call to make disciples for Jesus Christ, even when it meant years of separation from children and those at home. The letters are a treasure. His mother shares charming and tender accounts of daily struggles, separation and homesickness. His father's writing helps us see the dedication and difficulty of work with other cultures. What we are given in this book, also, is the story of a young boy becoming a young man. Harris allows us to follow his young life in China birth in a troubled year, early life with his parents, captured by pirates on the way to school, community life at Chefoo, Japanese internment camp, repatriation to America through troubled wartime seas and reunion after years of separation. \\"All we read here offers testimony to the faith of the Reverend Frederic G.

Serious collectors called their avocation \\"oology\\" and kept meticulous records for each set of eggs: the bird's name, the species reference number, the quantity of eggs in the clutch, the date and location where the eggs were collected, and the collector's name. These documented egg collections, which typically date from the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, now provide an important baseline from which to measure changes in the numbers, distribution, and nesting patterns of many species of birds. In Oology and Ralph's Talking Eggs, Carrol L. Henderson uses the vast egg collection of Ralph Handsaker, an Iowa farmer, as the starting point for a fascinating account of oology and its role in the origins of modern birdwatching, scientific ornithology, and bird conservation in North America. Henderson describes Handsaker's and other oologists' collecting activities, which included not only gathering bird eggs in the wild but also trading and purchasing eggs from collectors around the world. Henderson then spotlights sixty of the nearly five hundred bird species represented in the Handsaker collection, using them to tell the story of how birds such as the Snowy Egret, Greater Prairie Chicken, Atlantic Puffin, and Wood Duck have fared over the past hundred years or so since their eggs were gathered. Photos of the eggs and historical drawings and photos of the birds illustrate each species account. Henderson also links these bird histories to major milestones in bird conservation and bird protection laws in North America from 1875 to the present.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Ctl7U50svHEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sweet Lou","description":"Sweet Lou and the Cubs chronicles from the inside-out Lou Piniella's stirring and celebrated quest to reverse the team's fortunes after a record 100 years without a World Series championship.

In Yankee No! Alan McPherson sheds much-needed light on the controversial and pressing problem of anti-U.S. sentiment in the world. Examining the roots of anti-Americanism in Latin America, McPherson focuses on three major crises: the Cuban Revolution, the 1964 Panama riots, and U.S. intervention in the Dominican Republic. Deftly combining cultural and political analysis, he demonstrates the shifting and complex nature of anti-Americanism in each country and the love-hate ambivalence of most Latin Americans toward the United States. When rising panic over \\"Yankee hating\\" led Washington to try to contain foreign hostility, the government displayed a surprisingly coherent and consistent response, maintaining an ideological self-confidence that has outlasted a Latin American diplomacy torn between resentment and admiration of the United States. However, McPherson warns, U.S. leaders run a great risk if they continue to ignore the deeper causes of anti-Americanism. Written with dramatic flair, Yankee No! is a timely, compelling, and carefully researched contribution to international history. Table of Contents: Introduction Anti-Americanism as Historical Problem 1. The Road to Caracas Or, Richard Nixon Must Get Stoned 2. Cuba, 1959 Revolutionary Anti-Americanism and U.S. Panic 3. Panama, 1964 Conservative Anti-Americanism and U.S. Pragmatism 4. Dominican Republic, 1965 Episodic Anti-Americanism and U.S. Containment Epilogue Toward Global Anti-Americanism Abbreviations Notes Selected Sources Acknowledgments Index Reviews of this book: McPherson examines the years from 1958 to 1966, when anti-Americanism was a prominent theme in inter-American diplomacy, to deliver a helpful reminder that anti-Americanism is not a new phenomenon nor a product only of the Middle East--and that it has been confronted quite effectively in the past, at least when its sources were sought out and taken seriously. He provides several vivid case studies, starting with the attacks on Vice President Richard Nixon in Caracas and continuing on to Cuba, Panama, and the Dominican Republic. Together, these examples show the variability and ambivalence of anti-Americanism; they also emphasize the importance of U.S. policies that respond to its challenges rather than dismissing it as a cynical invention of alienated elites...This well-written and balanced book should be required reading in the White House, in Langley, and around Foggy Bottom. --Foreign Affairs Alan McPherson has not only made a valuable contribution to the literature on U.S.-Latin American relations but, more importantly, he has provided a superb analysis of anti-Americanism by identifying its variability, its ambivalence, and the U.S. resilience in confronting the challenge during the critical years framed in this book. In his sophistication and in his writing he demonstrates all the attributes of a seasoned historian. --Lester D. Langley, author of The Americas in the Modern Age McPherson expertly extends the field of U.S. foreign relations into social and cultural history. In his analysis of U.S. relations with Cuba, the Dominican Republic, and Panama, he deftly avoids the trap of writing international history solely with the 'view from Washington' perspective. I unequivocally recommend it. --Stephen Rabe, author of Eisenhower and Latin America This timely, deeply researched, analytically rigorous, and handsomely written study probes the many anti-Americanisms that have bedeviled U.S. relations with Latin America. Why do they hate us?' is an urgent question today. McPherson impressively demonstrates that it has profound historical roots that can inform caring policymakers eager to prevent global violence. --Thomas G. Paterson, author of Contesting Castro McPherson opens a revealing window on the heretofore elusive phenomenon of anti-Americanism. In so doing he takes his place in the front ranks of younger scholars writing about U.S. foreign relations. --William Walker, Florida International University","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=uW5CYPFMQasC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"On the Beach (Charnwood Library)","description":"Vol 1 905p Vol 2 961p.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Av4zvx1iSyQC&dq=On+the+Beach+(Charnwood+Library)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Republican Like Me: A Diary of My Presidential Campaign","description":"Forgive all debts, free the slaves was his campaign promise.

Aspects such as the advent of new technologies and the changing nature of the industry into one that is faster paced than ever before, as well as the shift towards more ethical and sustainable practices have resulted in a dramatic change of the roles. As a result, contemporary fast fashion retailers do not follow the traditional buying cycle processes step by step, critical paths are wildly different, and there has been a huge increase in  in-season buying  as a response to heightened consumer demand. This textbook is a comprehensive guide to 21st-century fashion buying and merchandising, considering fast fashion, sustainability, ethical issues, omnichannel retailing, and computer-aided design. It presents an up-to-date buying cycle that reflects key aspects of fashion buying and merchandising, as well as in-depth explanations of fashion product development, trend translation, and sourcing. It applies theoretical and strategic business models to buying and merchandising that have traditionally been used in marketing and management. This book is ideal for all fashion buying and merchandising students, specifically second- and final-year undergraduate as well as MA/MSc fashion students. It will also be useful to academics and practitioners who wish to gain a greater understanding of the industry today.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Z7XjDwAAQBAJ&dq=Miss-Guided&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mason & Dixon","description":"A grammatical textbook for the Pali language with Burmese and Sinhalese script (alongside the Romanization), this edition offers a combination of the new (2015) and the old (1868), with some eccentric digressions into the Ashokan inscriptions, theories of the history and origins of the language, and anecdotes from an era when European archaeology and scholarship were (re-)discovering Theravada Buddhist philosophy.

Over the last decade or so, one or another theological interpretation of either of these doctrines has assumed pride of place among theologians. Before Robert Sherman, though, no theologian has ever dared to read the atonement in light of the Trinity. Most of the time atonement theories simply focus on the redeeming work of Jesus Christ, without any reference to Christ's relationship to the Father and the Spirit of the Trinity. But, as Sherman argues, Christ's atoning work is diverse and cannot be limited to one who ransoms our sins or to one who has victory over our sins (although in Sherman's view Christ's atoning work includes these tasks and more). He offers here a constructive theological proposal that connects Trinity with the rubrics of prophet, priest, and king to help explain Christ's atoning work. One can understand adequately neither Christ's multifaceted reconciliation of a complex humanity to God nor that reconciliations fundamental unity as God's gracious act apart form the Trinity. Without this framework, one will likely stress one person of the Trinity, one aspect of God's reconciling work, and/or one understanding of the human predicament to the exclusion of others and the detriment of theology, both systematic and pastoral. Sherman's constructive theological proposal suggests that we should recognize a certain correspondence and mutual support between the three persons of the Trinity, the three offices of Christ (king, prophet, priest), and the three commonly recognized models of his atoning work (Christus victor, vicarious sacrifice, moral exemplar). Sherman's book offers a well-nuanced and well-grounded constructive theology of Trinitarian atonement and is a significant addition to the Theology for the Twenty-First Century Series. Robert J. Sherman is Professor of Christian Theology at Bangor Theological Seminary in Maine. His work has appeared in such publications as the Scottish Journal of Theology, the International Journal of Systematic Theology, and The Journal of Religion.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=TKmoAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tropico 2: Pirate Cove Official Strategy Guide","description":"BradyGames' Tropico 2: Pirate Cove Official Strategy Guide features winning strategies for every episode.

Germany, Russia, France, China, Japan: the maps were changing day by day. The hostilities spread in ever-widening ripples of destruction: Britain, Italy, Africa...The fate of the world hung in the balance. Then the real enemy came. Out of the dark of night, out of the soft glow of dawn, out of the clear blue sky came an invasion force the likes of which Earth had never known - and worldwar was truly joined. The invaders were inhuman and they were unstoppable. Their technology was far beyond our reach, and their goal was simple. Fleetlord Atvar had arrived to claim Earth for the Empire. Never before had Earth's people been more divided. Never had the need for unity been greater. And grudgingly, inexpertly, humanity took up the challenge. In this epic novel of alternate history, Harry Turtledove takes us around the globe. We roll with German panzers; watch the coast of Britain with the RAF; and welcome alien-liberators to the Warsaw ghetto. In tiny planes we skim the vast Russian steppe, and we push the envelope of technology in secret labs at the University of Chicago.

Maar het is de vorige first family die boven aan de hitlijst staat van een internationale terroristische organisatie.

Daar zou hij het liefst het leven van een 'gewone' burger willen leiden, maar een oud-president wordt nooit meer een gewone burger. En een oud-president heeft vijanden.

Halliburton's second book, The Glorious Adventure describes his journey through the Mediterranean in the shadow of his mythical hero. In Greece, Halliburton charged Mount Olympus 'in order to visit the gods that dwelled there'; he swam the Hellespont as Byron had before him and journeyed on to Troy, where Odysseus's long adventure began. He sailed to Stromboli in the Tyrrhenian Sea, home of Aeolus god of the winds; then to the Bay of Naples, Circeo - 'island' of Circe - and Li Galli, the siren isles that shimmered off the Amalfi coast. Battling through the Straits of Messina, Odysseus's Scylla and Charybdis, he explored Sicily and Corfu before setting out for the shores of Ithaca, long-forgotten home for one, the end of an adventure for another. As epic and eventful as The Odyssey itself and one of the most captivating travel books of the 20th century, The Glorious Adventure evokes the romance of another time, when heroes and gods walked the earth.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=8cLSwQEACAAJ&dq=The+Glorious+Adventure&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Simple Words Of Wisdom 52 Virtues For Every Woman","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=C38KPwAACAAJ&dq=Simple+Words+Of+Wisdom+52+Virtues+For+Every+Woman&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Auditing (Prentice Hall Series in Accounting)","description":"Updated to reflect new auditing and accounting standards, this reference on the theory, design, and application of auditing techniques includes numerous flowcharts of the audit process and an expanded discussion of computer-based systems","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=IxCcQgAACAAJ&dq=Auditing+(Prentice+Hall+Series+in+Accounting)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Orthodox Church","description":"The readable, deeply authoritative and bestselling book on the Orthodox Church, in a fully updated and revised Third Edition.

We call that rightness beauty, and it ought to be the single most important component of design.This recognition is at the heart of David Gelernter's witty argued essay, Machine Beauty, which defines beauty as an inspired mating of simplicity and power. You can see it in a Bauhaus chair, the Hoover Dam, or an Emerson radio circa 1930. In contrast, too many contemporary technologists run out of ideas and resort to gimmicks and features; they are rarely capable of real, structural ingenuity.Nowhere is this more evident than in the world of computers. You don't have to look far to see how oblivious most computer technologists are to the idea of beauty. Just look at how ugly your computer cabinet is, how unwieldy and out of sync it feels with the manner and speed with which you process thought.The best designers, however, are obsessed with beauty. Both hardware and software should afford us the greatest opportunity to achieve deep beauty, the kind of beauty that happens when many types of loveliness reinforce one another, when design expresses an underlying technology, a machine logic. Program software ought to be transparent; it should engage what Gelernter calls  a thought-amplifying feedback loop,  a creative symbiosis with its user. These principles, beautiful in themselves, will set the stage for the next technological revolution, in which the pursuit of elegance will lead to extraordinary innovations.Machine Beauty will delight Gelernter's growing audience, fans of his provocative and biting journalism. Anyone who manufactures, designs, or uses computers will be galvanized by his cogent arguments and tantalizing glimpse of a bright future, where beautiful technology abounds.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=bESwswEACAAJ&dq=Machine+Beauty:+Elegance+And+The+Heart+Of+Technology+(Master+Minds+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Dueling Machine","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=HkDCPQAACAAJ&dq=The+Dueling+Machine&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Skiffs and Schooners","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=7CFUAAAAMAAJ&dq=Skiffs+and+Schooners&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Contrary Farmer's Invitation to Gardening","description":"Gene Logsdon breaks down the garden walls and celebrates the side of gardening that isn't a finicky, style-obsessed, and expensive hobby but rather a hilarious, sensual, and endlessly satisfying way of life.

Why not the pigeons on the rafters of the barn, or bluegills and edible cattails from your own homestead pond? This is Gene Logsdon at his provocative best.

What began as a casual discourse, not too different from others I have had with inquisitive young people who have reached out to me, became a treasured and enlightening friendship that changed my life forever. With the purity of heart that only a child can possess, and the indomitable spirit of one who has survived more physical suffering than most adults will ever know, Mattie convinced me that his quest was not inconceivable. Inspired by his enthusiasm and without reservation, I committed to a partnership with him. . . . These words of wisdom and inspiration came from the most remarkable person I have ever known.\\" --Jimmy Carter Sometimes the most important messages come from the most unlikely places. Mattie J.T. Stepanek, a 13-year-old boy, made a difference before he died with his Heartsongs poetry. He continues to impact the world through Just Peace. This poet, best-selling author, peace activist, and prominent voice for the Muscular Dystrophy Association fervently believed in and promoted world peace not just as a concept, but as a reality. Mattie was working on this manuscript with Jimmy Carter when he died in June 2004. His mother, Jeni, who edited the material and wrote a preface for the book has published it at her son's request. Just Peace explores Mattie's concept of the world and all people as a unique mosaic of gifts. War and injustice shatter the mosaic, which can only be made whole again by planning and actively pursuing peace. The young visionary's essays, poetry, and photographs appear throughout the book. Jimmy Carter has written a special foreword for the book. Just as important to the book and enlightening to the reader are Mattie's many correspondences. Central to these are his personal e-mails to and from former president Jimmy Carter, Mattie's peace \\"hero\\" and role model. The Nobel Peace Prize winner met Mattie, considered him an angel, messenger, and hero in his own right, and was genuinely affected by Mattie's passion and drive. Just Peace is an intimate portrait of a president, a young man of hope, and peace itself.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UY-Ah6oj6tsC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Independent Schools Guide 2004-2005: A Fully Comprehensive Directory","description":"British education is recognized worldwide for its excellent academic standards and tradition of welcoming overseas students.

Buying the Big Jets has been published since 2001 to provide expert guidance to all those involved in aircraft selection strategies. This third edition brings the picture fully up to date, representing the latest developments in aircraft products and best practice in airline fleet planning techniques. It features a new section that addresses the passenger experience and, for the first time, includes regional jet manufacturers who are now extending their product families into the 100-plus seating category. Overall, the third edition looks at a broader selection of analytical approaches than previously and considers how fleet planning for cost-leader airlines differs from that of network carriers. Buying the Big Jets is an industry-specific example of strategic planning and is therefore a vital text for students engaged in graduate or post-graduate studies either in aeronautics or business administration. The book is essential reading for airline planners with fleet planning responsibility, consultancy groups, analysts studying aircraft performance and economics, airline operational personnel, students of air transport, leasing companies, aircraft value appraisers, and all who manage commercial aircraft acquisition programmes and provide strategic advice to decision-makers. It is also a valuable tool for the banking community where insights into aircraft acquisition decisions are vital.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=SAcqDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"AXIS SUBMARINE SUCCESSES 1939-45.","description":"Axis Midget Submarines details the history, weapons, and operations of German, Japanese, and Italian midget submarines during World War II. Over this period, Germany, Japan, and Italy built approximately 2,000 small, inherently stealthy, naval craft to perform special operations and conventional navy missions. Much more numerous and more technically advanced than their Allied counterparts, they saw service worldwide, operating in the Pacific, Mediterranean, Black Sea, Indian Ocean, North Sea, and the English Channel. Manned by courageous crews, these vessels made daring attacks on Allied ships in heavily protected anchorages using torpedoes and mines. Most notable were attacks against Gibraltar - launched from an Italian cargo vessel interred in nearby neutral Spain that had been converted into a clandestine support base and equipped with an underwater hatch - and Pearl Harbor. They were used against shipping in coastal waters and, near the end of the war, in desperate attempts to offset their opponents' overwhelming naval superiority during the US advance across the Pacific and the Allied amphibious landings in France and Italy. In this book, the term midget submarine includes submarines of less than 50 tons, equipped with two torpedoes and a crew of 1-4, and manned torpedoes, relatively short range torpedo-size craft with one or two operators and armed with either mines or one torpedo. It excludes vessels designed as suicide craft. It addresses operational vessels and prototypes, spanning 11 German, 4 Japanese, and 5 Italian classes. The most advanced types incorporated innovative design features and served as the basis for a number of post-war vessels. This book also briefly covers the larger vessels used to transport the midget submarines to their operational areas. Also included is an analysis of the effectiveness of these vessels, including an examination of their strengths and weaknesses. The success (or lack of success) will be discussed both in the context of the individual vessel design and as a component of their respective nation's submarine force. They are also compared to similar Allied designs.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=lSszvgAACAAJ&dq=AXIS+SUBMARINE+SUCCESSES+1939-45.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ten years later","description":"'The Indigo Children Oh yeah ... I know about them! Wasn't there a movie about that? They're those special kids who do psychic things and who have dark blue auras, right?'' If that's your take on the Indigos, then you really need to read this book. The Indigo Children aren't super-psychic kids with dark blue auras. In fact, the Indigo moniker has nothing to do with auras or being psychic. Some of these teenagers are actually the ones who are strapping on bombs and bringing guns to school, so you can see that the subject here is far more profound than the sensational hype that often accompanies it. This book is all about the children of our planet, what really might be happening with them, why they do what they do, and what we can do to help them and our educators survive all this. In addition, the Indigos are slowly beginning to join the workforce (gasp)! Join Lee Carroll and Jan Tober, the original authors of The Indigo Children, for a profound and frank discussion of this topic ten years later. After all this time, what do some in higher education say about these kids? What do industry leaders say? Humanity is evolving, so you should definitely be aware of these individuals' opinions. It's time to stop the circus that has been created around this subject and get down to finding out how to help these children survive in a world they don't understand ... or perhaps it's just you they don't understand.... Join the leaders of education and industry who speak out in this book for a peek into the real issues surrounding the Indigos, and perhaps the future of humanity!","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=P6pxRDe6LvgC&dq=Ten+years+later&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Friar's Bloodfeud (SIGNED)","description":"Can the evil at work ever be stopped?

One team, sequestered in the New Mexican desert, hastened to assemble the atomic bombs that would shake the world later that summer. The other team, a group of Nazi-sponsored physicists and technicians in southern Germany, struggled to do something that, unbeknownst to them, the Allies had done two years earlier: build a critical, self-sustaining nuclear reactor. Meanwhile, a different kind of team was running its own race against time. Convinced (erroneously) that the Germans were close to creating their own superweapon, the Allies sent an American unit of scientists, soldiers, and secret agents established by Lieutenant General Leslie R. Groves into Nazi Germany. Their orders: find the German scientific team before they could provide Hitler with atomic power. The scientific head of the mission: a Dutch-American physicist named Samuel A. Goudsmit. The mission code name: Alsos. As his small entourage moved closer to the German research camp, Goudsmit revisited familiar people and places now changed forever by the war. The first Allied scientist to interrogate the captured physicists, Goudsmit heard first hand about life in a Nazi Germany in which they had lived and worked for over a decade. Most importantly, as the last person to review German nuclear research papers before military classification barred them from the public eye, Goudsmit was uniquely qualified to answer the most puzzling question: why, after their spectacular early successes, did German nuclear research efforts fall so miserably? Goudsmit's insights into the errors and hindrances that frustrated the German scientists, as well as his penetrating character analyses, remain uncannily accurate, as proven a half-century later by the now de-classified documents.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=3v2ttYJ_d2kC&dq=Alsos+(History+of+Modern+Physics+and+Astronomy,+Vol+1)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hagia Sophia, 1850-1950: Holy Wisdom Modern Monument","description":"Hagia Sophia, the Church of Holy Wisdom, sits majestically atop the plateau that commands the straits separating Europe and Asia. Located near the acropolis of the ancient city of Byzantium, this unparalleled structure has enjoyed an extensive and colorful history, as it has successively been transformed into a cathedral, mosque, monument, and museum. In Hagia Sophia, 1850-1950, Robert S. Nelson explores its many lives. Built from 532 to 537 as the Cathedral of Constantinople, Hagia Sophia was little studied and seldom recognized as a great monument of world art until the nineteenth century, and Nelson examines the causes and consequences of the building's newly elevated status during that time. He chronicles the grand dome's modern history through a vibrant cast of characters emperors, sultans, critics, poets, archaeologists, architects, philanthropists, and religious congregations some of whom spent years studying it, others never visiting the building. But as Nelson shows, they all had a hand in the recreation of Hagia Sophia as a modern architectural icon. By many means and for its own purposes, the West has conceptually transformed Hagia Sophia into the international symbol that it is today. While other books have covered the architectural history of the structure, this is the first study to address its status as a modern monument. With his narrative of the building's rebirth, Nelson captures its importance for the diverse communities that shape and find meaning in Hagia Sophia. His book will resonate with cultural, architectural, and art historians as well as with those seeking to acquaint themselves with the modern life of an inspired and inspiring building.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=r-OsEpcTYpMC&dq=Hagia+Sophia,+1850-1950:+Holy+Wisdom+Modern+Monument&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Green Dolphin Street","description":"Vivid, exciting tales--earthquakes, shipwreck, encounters between New Zealand settlers and the indigenous Maori people--are paired with fascinating details of 19th-century life, from sailing ships and steamboats to women's fashions and the natural beauty of the British seacoast and the mountains and forests of New Zealand. When Marianne LePatourel meets William Ozanne in the 1830s on an island in the English Channel, she sets her heart on him. However, her sister Marguerite falls in love with him too. And so begins this sweeping novel that takes the characters on dramatic adventures from childhood through old age, on land and at sea, and from the Channel Islands to China to the New Zealand frontier. When William's naval career is cut short, he settles in New Zealand and writes to Mr. Le Patourel to ask for Marguerite's hand in marriage--but in his nervousness he pens the wrong name in his letter. It is Marianne who arrives aboard the ship The Green Dolphin, and William's gallant decision not to reveal his mistake sets in motion a marriage that is difficult, but teaches them both that steadfast love which is chosen is stronger than the passion of love at first sight.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=S7NRrgEACAAJ&dq=Green+Dolphin+Street&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Other Parent: The Inside Story of the Media's Effect on Our Children","description":"Examines how we have allowed media to bombard our children's lives and offers practical advice on countering the incessant parade of images that frighten, intrigue, and influence America's kids.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=AjWoeAXICHAC&dq=The+Other+Parent:+The+Inside+Story+of+the+Media%27s+Effect+on+Our+Children&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The oneness of things ;: The reality of spirit","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=1ZgNNQAACAAJ&dq=The+oneness+of+things+%3B:+The+reality+of+spirit&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Partnering Imperative: Making Business Partnerships Work","description":"There is no shortage of strategic reasons for taking partnering seriously in today's converging and colliding marketplace.

This study focuses on the stereotype of the woman as a Canaanite as well as Matthew's sources and the form of the story.

It is commonly viewed as a defiant barrier, the end of the empire, a place where civilization stopped and barbarism began. In fact, the massive structure remains shrouded in mystery. Was the wall intended to keep out the Picts, who inhabited the North? Or was it merely a symbol of Roman power and wealth? What was life like for soldiers stationed along its expanse? How was the extraordinary structure built -- with what technology, skills, and materials? In Hadrian's Wall, Adrian Goldsworthy embarks on a historical and archaeological investigation, sifting fact from legend while simultaneously situating the wall in the wider scene of Roman Britain. The result is a concise and enthralling history of a great architectural marvel of the ancient world.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PDAwDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Cherokee Lottery: A Sequence of Poems","description":"A sequence of poems inspired by the forced removal of the Southern Indians, written by contemporary American author William Jay Smith.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=r3hbAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Cherokee+Lottery:+A+Sequence+of+Poems&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Beet the Vandel Buster, Vol. 2","description":"Monsters known as Vandels rule the world and when they kill a group of Busters, the only warriors able to defeat them, the magic Saiga weapons are passed on to Beet, who is determined to rid the world of them and end the Century of Darkness.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=7vrjHiwLE0gC&dq=Beet+the+Vandel+Buster,+Vol.+2&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Making Melody Popular Choruses and Hymns","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Xj6DAAAACAAJ&dq=Making+Melody+Popular+Choruses+and+Hymns&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Portrait of Edinburgh","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=2XyEAQAACAAJ&dq=Portrait+of+Edinburgh&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"History of the Second World War","description":"Victor Rothwell examines the origins of World War II, from the flawed peace settlement in 1919 to the start of the true world war at Pearl Harbor in 1941.

Written by Pulitzer Prize-winner Stephen Hunter, the widely admired and bestselling novelist and author of such books as Havana, Hot Springs, and Dirty White Boys, and John Bainbridge, Jr., an experienced journalist and lawyer, American Gunfight is at once a groundbreaking work of meticulous historical research and the vivid and dramatically told story of an act of terrorism that almost succeeded. They have pieced together, at last, the story of the conspiracy that nearly doomed the president and how a few good men -- ordinary guys who were willing to risk their lives in the line of duty -- stopped it. It is a book about courage -- on both sides -- and about what politics and devotion to a cause can lead men to do, and about what actually happens, second by second, when a gunfight explodes. It begins on November 1, 1950, an unseasonably hot afternoon in the sleepy capital. At 2:00 P.M. in his temporary residence at Blair House, the president of the United States takes a nap. At 2:20 P.M., two men approach Blair House from different directions. Oscar Collazo, a respected metal polisher and family man, and Griselio Torresola, an unemployed salesman, don't look dangerous, not in their new suits and hats, not in their calm, purposeful demeanor, not in their slow, unexcited approach. What the three White House policemen and one Secret Service agent cannot guess is that under each man's coat is a 9mm German automatic pistol and in each head, a dream of assassin's glory. At point-blank range, Collazo and then Torresola draw and fire and move toward the president of the United States. Hunter and Bainbridge tell the story of that November day with narrative power and careful attention to detail. They are the first to report on the inner workings of this conspiracy; they examine the forces that led the perpetrators to conceive the plot. The authors also tell the story of the men themselves, from their youth and the worlds in which they grew up to the women they loved and who loved them to the moment the gunfire erupted. Their telling commemorates heroism -- the quiet commitment to duty that in some moments of crisis sees some people through an ordeal, even at the expense of their lives.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=5b2dnzu54ZEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Frank Lloyd Wright: Designs for Glass: A Journal","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=yq-RjwEACAAJ&dq=Frank+Lloyd+Wright:+Designs+for+Glass:+A+Journal&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Essentials of Entrepreneurship : What it Takes to Create Successful Enterprises","description":"A gold mine of advice and guidance from an international team of entrepreneurial all-stars From TiE, the world's largest not-for-profit entrepreneurial organization, this valuable handbook features chapters written by acknowledged experts in their respective fields.

Comparing the general public s reaction to the Holocaust in Nazi Germany with American public opinion of U.S. participation in the genocidal policies of Nicaraguan counter-revolutionary forces, and the governments of Guatemala and El Salvador among others, Porpora demonstrates that moral indifference to the suffering of others was the common response. With reference to Hannah Arendt s thesis of the banality of evil, he develops the concept of a \\"Holocaust-like event\\" and examines how even a democratic society can be capable of something on the order of a Holocaust. Unlike other accounts of the Holocaust and genocide, this book focuses on the citizenry served or ruled by genocidal governments rather than on the governments themselves. Porpora argues that moral indifference and lack of interest in critical reflection are key factors that enable Holocaust-like events to happen And he characterizes American society as being typically indifferent to the fate of other people, uninformed, and anti-intellectual. Porpora cites numerous horrifying examples of U.S.-backed Latin American government actions against their own peasants, Indians, and dissident factions. He offers finally a theory of public moral indifference and argues that although such indifference is socially created by government, the media, churches, and other institutions, we, the public, must ultimately take responsibility for it. How Holocausts Happen is at once a scholarly examination of the nature of genocide and a stinging indictment of American society.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=O8xaVnlyndYC&dq=How+Holocausts+Happen:+The+United+States+in+Central+America&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Legion Tourney: A Bronc Burnett story","description":"Sonora tries for the state championship in the American Legion Junior Baseball Tourney.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=uS9QAQAAMAAJ&dq=Legion+Tourney:+A+Bronc+Burnett+story&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Impact of Occupational Dislocation: The American Indian Labor Force at the Close of the Twentieth Century (Native Americans: Interdisciplinary Perspectives)","description":"This study broadens our knowledge of the relationship between occupational prestige, family composition, and migratory patterns of American Indians at the close of the twentieth century.

DC Icons continues with the first-ever YA origin story of superhero Black Canary, from the internationally bestselling author Alexandra Monir. In this thrilling novel, Dinah Lance's voice is her weapon. And in a near-future world where women have no rights, she won't hesitate to use everything she has--including her song--to fight back. Dinah Lance was eight years old when she overheard the impossible: the sound of a girl singing. It was something she was never meant to hear--not in her lifetime and not in Gotham City, taken over by the vicious, patriarchal Court of Owls. The sinister organization rules Gotham City as a dictatorship and has stripped women of everything--their right to work, to make music, to learn, to be free.

If as some believe, Loch Ness harbours a species of unknown creatures then why haven't they been found and catalogued? In this sophisticated day and age where satellites in space can read the print of a newspaper held by a man in the street we still don't know what secrets are held in this deep Scottish loch.

Maybe...But in Nazi occupied Europe, during that first week of September, 1944, nothing could be less certain. The Allied armada, which had been scraping the heels of Hitler's army, is running out of supplies while the Germans are stiffening their defense. News reports are erratic... In Belgium, Montgomery's 21st army group, coming from the north, is zipping through what will be recorded in history as a mad surprise dash toward Brussels where five fugitives are trapped in a mansion on Castle Street. In France, where war news is practically non existent, Parisians learn that the whispered rumors about escape lines are a reality. Judging by unidentified luggage left behind, 93 people went to a certain Doctor Petiot's \\"safe\\"house,\\" never to be seen or heard of again. Online review; FIFTY FIVE CASTLE STREET... RATING **** From a reviewer, a fan of well written mysteries, April 4, 2003 WHAT A STORY! Knowing what we do know of the evils perpetrated during World War II, it is not surprising that someone like Ms. Vogel's Dr. Berval could exist. Her character was insired by an actual French butcher (Dr.Marcel Petiot) . Ms. Vogel fictionalizes the location, the protagonist and his victims while creating a compelling tale that keeps the story filled with fascinating characters and unexpected plot. FIFTY FIVE CASTLE STREET is truly an unexpected delight for a first novel.

Distinguished researchers have contributed new and updated material in their own areas of expertise. The controversy about the value of naturalistic research, as opposed to traditional laboratory methods, is outlined, and the two approaches are seen to have converged and become complementary rather than antagonistic. The editors bring together studies on many different topics, such as memory for plans and actions, for names and faces, for routes and maps, life experiences and flashbulb memory, and eyewitness memory. Emphasis is also given to the role of memory in consciousness and metacognition. New topics covered in this edition include life span development of memory, collaborative remembering, deja-vu and memory dysfunction in the real world.

'Over the weekend the vultures got into the presidential palace by pecking through the screens on the balcony windows and the flapping of their wings stirred up the stagnant time inside' As the citizens of an unnamed Caribbean nation creep through dusty corridors in search of their tyrannical leader, they cannot comprehend that the frail and withered man lying dead on the floor can be the self-styled General of the Universe. Their arrogant, manically violent leader, known for serving up traitors to dinner guests and drowning young children at sea, can surely not die the humiliating death of a mere mortal? Tracing the demands of a man whose egocentric excesses mask the loneliness of isolation and whose lies have become so ingrained that they are indistinguishable from truth, Marquez has created a fantastical portrait of despotism that rings with an air of reality. 'Delights with its quirky humanity and black humour and impresses by its total originality' Vogue 'Captures perfectly the moral squalor and political paralysis that enshrouds a society awaiting the death of a long-term dictator' Guardian 'Marquez writes in this lyrical, magical language that no-one else can do' Salman Rushdie","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ix-VAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"THEORY AND PRACTICE OF COMMUNISM: AN INTRODUCTION","description":"Analyse af hvordan marxismen blev omsat til praksis i Sovjetunionen i sammenligning med kommunismens teori","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=tO5SMSMy88IC&dq=THEORY+AND+PRACTICE+OF+COMMUNISM:+AN+INTRODUCTION&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The conduct of life","description":"The Conduct of Life is a collection of essays by Ralph Waldo Emerson published in 1860 and revised in 1876. In this volume, Emerson sets out to answer \\"the question of the times: \\" \\"How shall I live?\\"[1] It is composed of nine essays, each preceded by a poem. These nine essays are largely based on lectures Emerson held throughout the country, including for a young, mercantile audience in the lyceums of the Midwestern boomtowns of the 1850s. The Conduct of Life has been named as both one of Emerson's best works and one of his worst. It was one of Emerson's most successful publications and has been identified as a source of influence for a number of writers, including Friedrich Nietzsche Three years after publishing his English Traits, Boston's Ticknor & Fields announced on 27 December 1859, an \\"early appearance\\" of a new book by Emerson titled The Conduct of Life. Confirmed as \\"completed\\" on 10 November 1860, Emerson's seventh major work came out on 12 December of the same year-simultaneously in the US and in Great Britain (published there by Smith, Elder & Co.).

A few years ago, customs officers at the border were meticulously checking goods and documents before releasing a shipment to the trader. A business could be confident that a shipment that had cleared customs complied with all applicable regulations. Today, to reduce congestion and give the trade quick access to their goods, customs have introduced risk management principles and a large number of shipments clear customs automatically. Controls have moved from the border to the trader s premises and it is during site visits that customs officers check the business compliance records. Moving from frontier checks to audit based controls has transferred a high level of responsibility and risk to the trader. It is now the duty of the trader to identify and report any error or irregularity and to keep an impeccable audit trail from initial quotation to receipt of payment. For the business, failing to provide satisfactory compliance records will result in delayed shipments and serious disruption in the supply chain. This will in turn impact on financial performance indicators such as Days in Inventory, Days Sales Outstanding and of course Cash Flow. The business will also have to endure in depth customs audits during which customs officers will inspect each step of the audit trail disrupting day-to-day business operation. Errors uncovered during these audits will yield heavy financial penalties and a customs debt. Ultimately, customs risk will impact on shareholders value. Customs and finance reporting should receive the same level of attention. However, if all companies check carefully their tax returns, only a few check their import or export declarations with the same scrutiny. Managing customs risk is often seen as a cost centre but it is also a source of competitive advantage. A sound customs management can reduce or remove customs duties, generate savings, and generally improve cash flow using the many customs procedures available to the compliant trader. Help is at hand, A Short Guide to Customs Risk will enable you to make informed decisions, and includes a foreword by the Head of the World Customs Organization: Kunio Mikuriya.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=9LHmulR-YJoC&dq=Customs&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Condor Passes","description":"From the Pulitzer Prizewinning novelist: A family saga of a wealthy man s rise and his children s fight for his fortune in 1920s New Orleans.

When Dayna Curry and Heather Mercer arrived in Afghanistan, they had come to help bring a better life and a little hope to some of the poorest and most oppressed people in the world. Within a few months, their lives were thrown into chaos as they became pawns in historic international events. They were arrested by the ruling Taliban government for teaching about Christianity to the people with whom they worked. In the middle of their trial, the events of September 11, 2001, led to the international war on terrorism, with the Taliban a primary target. While many feared Curry and Mercer could not survive in the midst of war, Americans nonetheless prayed for their safe return, and in November their prayers were answered. In Prisoners of Hope, Dayna Curry and Heather Mercer tell the story of their work in Afghanistan, their love for the people they served, their arrest, trial, and imprisonment by the Taliban, and their rescue by U.S. Special Forces. The heart of the book will discuss how two middle-class American women decided to leave the comforts of home in exchange for the opportunity to serve the disadvantaged, and how their faith motivated them and sustained them through the events that followed. Their story is a magnificent narrative of ordinary women caught in extraordinary circumstances as a result of their commitment to serve the poorest and most oppressed women and children in the world.

We venture to San Francisco, urban Fairbanks, and Big Sur, too, but Jim's real subject is the deeper and darker terrain of a human heart seeking peace, meaning, happiness, and glimpses of truth. The poems hang together on the music of Jim's warm and witty voice. Come along. Let's ponder Jim's messages with him. Jean Anderson Fairbanks, Alaska Also by Jim Hunter Messages from the Mountains Reader Comments \\"I like Jim Hunter's poetry...it imparts the tranquility and solitude of far away, remote places along with the sacrifices and dangers which come with being there...the poems bring forth passion and peace...he speaks from the heart about being in the wilderness...puts the burden on each and everyone of us to make our own decisions on where we fit in the environment.\\" Marcy H. Moab, Utah 07-09-02 \\"Even though we approach poetry from opposite directions: I favor the particular and Jim appears to favor the general, I enjoyed all the poems in Messages From The Bombing Range .... my favorite is \\"if Not For The Owl At Night\\"...which strikes me as a perfect poem, one which captures the northern experience: the life within the stillness.\\" Tom Sexton Alaska Poet Laureate 07-06-00 \\"Mr. Hunter reminds us that we can feel most alive and human in the surroundings where few humans exist. He took me to the wilderness, and I couldn't help but feel both the healing effects and vast aloneness of lengthy journies into the wilds. I completely enjoyed Mr. Hunter's work...the experience ended too soon. I will highly recommend this book to other poetry readers.\\" Westerville, OH October 5, 2002 \\"It had honest prose and excellent style.

Responding to postmodernist conceptions of genre and post-feminist theories of gender and sexuality, these essays move beyond the limits of representation. Testing new thinking about genre, gender, and sexuality against closely analyzed films, they explore generic convention as means of putting into play what our culture makes of us, while finding in genre's repetitions infinite possibilities of cross-generic, cross-gender, cross-sex permutation. At the same time the aesthetic and emotional dimensions of gender and sexuality come into view as elements fuelling the dramatic worlds of film genres, producing in the encounter new gendered perceptions, affects, and effects. Drawing on the intensifying transnational context of film production and on postcolonial thinking, this volume includes essays that explore the transformational transactions between gender and genre as world-circulating Hollywood generic practices intersect with and are stimulated by American independent, European, Indian, and Hong Kong cinemas. Such revised concepts of genre and gender question taken-for-granted relationships between authorship and genre, between centre and periphery, between feminism and generic filmmaking, and the supposed gendering of genres, filmmakers and their audiences.

(Peaches Dan Mysteries)","description":"Like other fictional characters, female sleuths may live in the past or the future. They may represent current times with some level of reality or shape their settings to suit an agenda. There are audiences for both realism and escapism in the mystery novel. It is interesting, however, to compare the fictional world of the mystery sleuth with the world in which readers live. Of course, mystery readers do not share one simplistic world. They live in urban, suburban, and rural areas, as do the female heroines in the books they read. They may choose a book because it has a familiar background or because it takes them to places they long to visit. Readers may be rich or poor; young or old; conservative or liberal. So are the heroines. What incredible choices there are today in mystery series! This three-volume encyclopedia of women characters in the mystery novel is like a gigantic menu. Like a menu, the descriptions of the items that are provided are subjective. Volume 3 of Mystery Women as currently updated adds an additional 42 sleuths to the 500 plus who were covered in the initial Volume 3. These are more recently discovered sleuths who were introduced during the period from January 1, 1990 to December 31, 1999. This more than doubles the number of sleuths introduced in the 1980s (298 of whom were covered in Volume 2) and easily exceeded the 347 series (and some outstanding individuals) described in Volume 1, which covered a 130-year period from 1860-1979. It also includes updates on those individuals covered in the first edition; changes in status, short reviews of books published since the first edition through December 31, 2008.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7dSx1CEeLOkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lovers and Gamblers","description":"A book that left burn marks on night tables across continents, 'Lovers And Gamblers 'has become a Collins classic.

As He sat on the Mount of Olives, where in the future His feet shall stand in the day of His manifestation, He prophesied concerning the destruction of the magnificent temple building, and His disciples questioned Him, saying, \\"'Tell us when shall these things be? And what shall be the sign of Thy coming and of the end of the age?\\" (Matt. 24:3, R. V., margin). In answer to their questions, the Lord, looking through the years to the consummation of the age, pointed out certain unmistakable signs by which believers were to know when the age was drawing to a close. He saw kingdom rising against kingdom, and nation against nation. He heard the sound of war and rumors of war. He saw pestilence and earthquake, Bolshevism, Communism, anarchy, lawlessness. He saw a time of trouble, the like of which has not yet been known, a time which He called \\"the great tribulation.\\" He spoke plainly concerning these matters in order that the believers in every age might be fully instructed. Among these conditions and events the Lord warned His disciples concerning the religious conditions that would prevail in the end time. \\"False Christs, and false prophets, shall arise,\\" He declared. So great will be their delusions at that time that \\"if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect.\\" The Holy Spirit, coming on the day of Pentecost, heralded through Paul, Peter, James, and John, and the other inspired writers, the same warning, making it known that toward the end of the age the great foundational truths of the gospel will be denied. The word \\"Denial\\" will characterize the religious condition of Christendom when those closing days become reality. The days in which you and I are living are days in which Christians need to know their Bibles, for the only way by which we may know whether or not a system of teaching is of God is by viewing the system through the lens of Holy Writ--reading the system in the light of the Bible and not reading the Bible in the light of the system. Because of the crying need of Biblical light on these erroneous teachings, I gave a series of addresses in the Church of the Open Door, on \\"The Cult Kingdom,\\" selecting ten of the most damaging heresies for discussion. When people saw them revealed in the searchlight of God's Word a large number of men and women, held in their grip, were mercifully delivered. This created a wide-spread interest among God's children, culminating in a demand for the printing of these addresses so that others, caught in the meshes of false doctrine, might also find freedom. I was about to comply with this request when I discovered a book compiled by William C. Irvine, called \\"HERESIES EXPOSED.\\" This book completely covers not only the ten cults I exposed, but many others, so instead of publishing my addresses I have arranged with the writer to allow me to print this special edition of his excellent work. By so doing we meet the demand of friends for this material and provide my radio audience with another valuable book.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=BgE1uQEACAAJ&dq=Heresies+Exposed:+A+Brief+Critical+Examination+in+the+Light+of+the+Holy+Scriptures+of+Some+of+the+Prevailing+Heresies+and+False+Teachings+of+Today&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hunting The Dead: Methods of Ghost Chasing","description":"Take a plunge into the heart of ghost hunting.

WAARGEBEURD. LEEST ALS EEN THRILLER! In de overtuiging dat Groot-Brittanni? was verwikkeld in een existenti?le strijd om haar voortbestaan richtte Churchill een geheime dienst op: de SOE (Special Operations Executive). De spionnen in deze dienst behoorden tot de cr me de la cr me. Hun taak was, zo verklaarde Churchill, om Europa in 'lichterlaaie' te zetten. Maar met nagenoeg alle mannen aan het front was de SOE gedwongen over te gaan tot een ongeevenaarde stap: het rekruteren van vrouwen. 39 vrouwen lieten hun families en geliefden achter en meldden zich aan... Dit is hun verhaal. In D-Day Girls vertelt Sarah Rose aan de hand van recent geopenbaard archiefmateriaal, dagboeken en herinneringen het verhaal van deze vrouwen uit de SOE: Andr e Borrel, een vechtlustige en gewiekste Parisienne die, met de Gestapo op haar hielen, vele Duitse verbindingslijnen wist te saboteren; Odette Sansom, een ongelukkig getrouwde jonge moeder die de SOE zag als een ontsnapping uit haar saaie leven naar een betekenisvol groots avontuur en Lise de Baissac, een sterk en onafhankelijk lid van de Franse 'high society' en ontegenzeggelijk de koningin van de SOE. Samen met 36 andere vrouwen legden zij met hun spionage- en sabotageactiviteiten achter de vijandelijke linies de basis voor het succes van de D-Day-invasie, die uiteindelijk de ommekeer van de Tweede Wereldoorlog zou worden.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7gLWDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The NIV Rainbow Study Bible (New International Version)","description":"The NIV Rainbow Study Bible has a unique color-coding system that allows readers to quickly and easily identify twelve major themes of Scripture throughout the text: God, discipleship, love, faith, sin, evil, salvation, family, outreach, commandments, history, and prophecy.

A must-read.\\" Tom Brokaw For soldiers in the 101st Airborne Division, the road to Baghdad began with a midnight flight out of Fort Campbell, Kentucky, in late February 2003. For Rick Atkinson, who would spend nearly two months covering the division for The Washington Post, the war in Iraq provided a unique opportunity to observe today's U.S. Army in combat. Now, in this extraordinary account of his odyssey with the 101st, Atkinson presents an intimate and revealing portrait of the soldiers who fight the expeditionary wars that have become the hallmark of our age. At the center of Atkinson's drama stands the compelling figure of Major General David H. Petraeus, described by one comrade as \\"the most competitive man on the planet.\\" Atkinson spent virtually all day every day at Petraeus's elbow in Iraq, where he had an unobstructed view of the stresses, anxieties, and large joys of commanding 17,000 soldiers in combat. And all around Petraeus, we see the men and women of a storied division grapple with the challenges of waging war in an unspeakably harsh environment. With the eye of a master storyteller, a brilliant military historian puts us right on the battlefield. In the Company of Soldiers is a compelling, utterly fresh view of the modern American soldier in action.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=OnHNwAEACAAJ&dq=In+the+Company+of+Soldiers+:+A+Chronicle+of+Combat&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Brainwashing, Drunks & Madness: Memoirs of a Medical Icon","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=7KnSAQAACAAJ&dq=Brainwashing,+Drunks&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Encyclopedia of African and African-American Religions","description":"\\"Numerous titles focusing on particular beliefs in Africa exist, including Marcel Griaule's Conversations with Ogotemmeli, but this one presents an unparallelled exploration of a multitude of cultures and experiences.

The centerpiece of this volume is the acclaimed Prison Notes, a powerful account of the twenty-seven days Barbara Deming and thirty-five others spent in an Albany, Georgia, jail during their Canada-to-Cuba Walk for Peace in 1963 and 1964. Demanding that black demonstrators and white demonstrators be able to walk together, the peace marchers were imprisoned, leading many in the group to fast and employ other nonviolent techniques of protest. Their presence and discipline had a lasting effect on the Albany Movement and other nonpacifist civil rights groups in the South. The remainder of the book relates Deming's final protest walk some twenty years later in 1983 with the Seneca Women's Peace Encampment, a group of women-only peace marchers scheduled to walk from Seneca, New York, the site of the first Women's Rights Declaration in 1848, to the missile base in Romulus, New York. This nonviolent march in honor of Elizabeth Cady Stanton and other feminist heroines was interrupted by protestors. Deming and fifty-three other women were arrested and spent five days in a Waterloo, New York, jail. These events are told in \\"A New Spirit Moves Among Us,\\" an essay written in letter form to a friend in defense of women-only actions, an interview with Deming conducted after her release from jail, and a statement of purpose issued from jail by the Waterloo Fifty-Four. As Grace Paley notes in her introduction, Prisons That Could Not Hold is \\"the story of two walks undertaken to help change the world without killing it. Barbara Deming was an important member of both. Twenty years of her brave life lie between them. . . . That difference between the two walks measures a development in movement history and also tells the distance Barbara traveled in those twenty years.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=yXcjBlA3u-AC&dq=Prisons+That+Could+Not+Hold&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sewing With Sergers: The Complete Handbook for Overlock Sewing","description":"An introduction to the machine and its features, as well as tips on threading, stitch types, tension, rolled edging, and flatlocking.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=VSFc1IXx8H4C&dq=Sewing+With+Sergers:+The+Complete+Handbook+for+Overlock+Sewing&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Tent Dwellers","description":"The Tent Dwellers","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=pRZItAEACAAJ&dq=The+Tent+Dwellers&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Niv Study Bible","description":"Dive into a deeper study of God s Word with the comprehensive NIV Study Bible The beloved NIV Study Bible features a stunning four-color interior with full-color photographs, maps, charts, and illustrations that bring the stories of the Bible to life.

Garrison's Church Planting Movements: How God Is Redeeming a Lost World signaled a breakthrough in missionary church planting. After the publication of Garrison's book in 2004 it became impossible to talk about missions without referencing Church Planting Movements. Church Planting Movements examines more than two-dozen movements of multiplying churches on five continents. After presenting these case studies, Garrison identifies ten universal elements present in each movement. He then broadens the circle of examination to identify a further ten common characteristics, factors identified in most, but not all, of the movements. He concludes his examination with a list of \\"Seven Deadly Sins,\\" i.e. harmful practices that stifle or impede Church Planting Movements. Important for evangelical readers, the author returns to his findings to see how they stand up to the light of Scripture. What he discovers is that Church Planting Movements are much more consistent with the New Testament lay-led house-church movements that swept rapidly through the Mediterranean world in the face of hostile opposition than today's more sedentary professional institutionalized Christianity.

A treatment of the structure of writing systems their relation to speech and language, their material features, linguistic functions, and norms, as well as the different types in which they come is complemented by perspectives centring on the use of writing, incorporating psycholinguistic and sociolinguistic issues such as reading processes or orthographic variation as social action. Examples stem from a variety of diverse systems such as Chinese, English, Japanese, Arabic, Thai, German, and Korean, which allows defining concepts in a broadly applicable way and thereby constructing a comparative grapholinguistic framework that provides readers with important tools for studying any writing system. The book emphasizes that grapholinguistics is a discipline in its own right, inviting discussion and further research in this up-and-coming field as well as an overdue integration of writing into general linguistic discussion.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=KEV3EAAAQBAJ&dq=Writing+Systems:+An+Introduction+to+Their+Linguistic+Analysis+(Cambridge+Textbooks+in+Linguistics)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Complete Phantom of the Opera","description":"This is the lavishly illustrated, definitive account of The Phantom of the Opera, tracing the Phantom legend from its origins in historical fact through Gaston Leroux's heartrending classic novel and other artistic incarnations to the present day and Andrew Lloyd Webber's incredibly successful musical.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ZNSgIAAACAAJ&dq=The+Complete+Phantom+of+the+Opera&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Beet the Vandel Buster, Vol. 3","description":"Beet is gonna beat the odds, and bust those violent Vandels!

In 1969, after seven years as a Roman Catholic nun -- hoping, but ultimately failing, to find God -- Armstrong left her convent. She knew almost nothing of the changed world she was entering, and she was tormented by panic attacks and inexplicable seizures. Her struggle against despair was fueled by a string of discouragements -- failed spirituality, doctorate and jobs, fruitless dealings with psychiatrists -- but finally, in 1976, she was diagnosed with epilepsy and given proper treatment. She then began the writing career that would become her true calling, and as she focused on the sacred texts of Judaism, Christianity and Islam, her own true inner story began to emerge. She would come to experience brief moments of transcendence through her work -- the profound fulfillment that she had not found in the long hours of prayer as a young nun.

A few years ago, customs officers at the border were meticulously checking goods and documents before releasing a shipment to the trader. A business could be confident that a shipment that had cleared customs complied with all applicable regulations. Today, to reduce congestion and give the trade quick access to their goods, customs have introduced risk management principles and a large number of shipments clear customs automatically. Controls have moved from the border to the trader s premises and it is during site visits that customs officers check the business compliance records. Moving from frontier checks to audit based controls has transferred a high level of responsibility and risk to the trader. It is now the duty of the trader to identify and report any error or irregularity and to keep an impeccable audit trail from initial quotation to receipt of payment. For the business, failing to provide satisfactory compliance records will result in delayed shipments and serious disruption in the supply chain. This will in turn impact on financial performance indicators such as Days in Inventory, Days Sales Outstanding and of course Cash Flow. The business will also have to endure in depth customs audits during which customs officers will inspect each step of the audit trail disrupting day-to-day business operation. Errors uncovered during these audits will yield heavy financial penalties and a customs debt. Ultimately, customs risk will impact on shareholders value. Customs and finance reporting should receive the same level of attention. However, if all companies check carefully their tax returns, only a few check their import or export declarations with the same scrutiny. Managing customs risk is often seen as a cost centre but it is also a source of competitive advantage. A sound customs management can reduce or remove customs duties, generate savings, and generally improve cash flow using the many customs procedures available to the compliant trader. Help is at hand, A Short Guide to Customs Risk will enable you to make informed decisions, and includes a foreword by the Head of the World Customs Organization: Kunio Mikuriya.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=9LHmulR-YJoC&dq=Customs&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Anna Pavlova, Jewel of the Ballet","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=bk8GAQAACAAJ&dq=Anna+Pavlova,+Jewel+of+the+Ballet&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"BUTTER AND GUNS: America's Cold War Economic Diplomacy","description":"Presents a fifty-year history of American economic diplomacy, exploring the ways in which it was largely responsible for the fall of communism in 1989","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=dVmFAAAAIAAJ&dq=BUTTER+AND+GUNS:+America%27s+Cold+War+Economic+Diplomacy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Belly and Its Power","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=BAfUPQAACAAJ&dq=Belly+and+Its+Power&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Ring and a Rainbow (Silhouette Romance)","description":"FIRST COMES LOVE  He'd been the love of Claire Dent's life.

While the Feather River was dredged for millions in gold in the late-19th century, the climate of Oroville was discovered to be well suited to growing oranges and olives, as well for a viable logging industry. One of America's first electric railroads passed through the town, and in 1937, the Feather River Highway stretched all the way to Reno. In 1968, the largest dam in the nation was constructed, and that feat of engineering provided electricity to a large number of California residents. Captured here in over 200 vintage images, James Lenhoff shows readers a California town that boomed with the Gold Rush and today remains a thriving community. Showcasing photographs from personal and community collections, the images in this book portray the residents that made Oroville what it is today, from the famous miners to the local farmers.

Although there are generic encyclopedias describing basic social science research methodologies in general, until now there has been no comprehensive A-to-Z reference work exploring methods specific to communication and media studies. Our entries, authored by key figures in the field, focus on special considerations when applied specifically to communication research, accompanied by engaging examples from the literature of communication, journalism, and media studies. Entries cover every step of the research process, from the creative development of research topics and questions to literature reviews, selection of best methods (whether quantitative, qualitative, or mixed) for analyzing research results and publishing research findings, whether in traditional media or via new media outlets. In addition to expected entries covering the basics of theories and methods traditionally used in communication research, other entries discuss important trends influencing the future of that research, including contemporary practical issues students will face in communication professions, the influences of globalization on research, use of new recording technologies in fieldwork, and the challenges and opportunities related to studying online multi-media environments. Email, texting, cellphone video, and blogging are shown not only as topics of research but also as means of collecting and analyzing data. Still other entries delve into considerations of accountability, copyright, confidentiality, data ownership and security, privacy, and other aspects of conducting an ethical research program. Features: 652 signed entries are contained in an authoritative work spanning four volumes available in choice of electronic or print formats. Although organized A-to-Z, front matter includes a Reader s Guide grouping entries thematically to help students interested in a specific aspect of communication research to more easily locate directly related entries. Back matter includes a Chronology of the development of the field of communication research; a Resource Guide to classic books, journals, and associations; a Glossary introducing the terminology of the field; and a detailed Index.

His desire is for Christians to \\"work for consensus, or at least for unity in God's work despite our differences on secondary matters.\\" Employing a helpful narrative approach and an ample number of stories, Keener enters into constructive dialogue with Pentecostals, moderates, and cessationists, all the while attempting to learn from each viewpoint. He seeks to bridge the gap between cessationists and Pentecostals/charismatics by urging all Christians to seek the Holy Spirit's empowerment. His irenic approach to this controversial issue has been endorsed by charismatics and non-charismatics alike. Sure to provoke helpful dialogue on a topic that has caused unfortunate divisions within the church, Gift and Giver will be a valuable addition to college and seminary courses on pneumatology. It will also be helpful to lay readers interested in a balanced discussion of spiritual gifts.

From his unique perspective as both theoretical physicist and Anglican priest, Polkinghorne considers aspects of quantum physics and theology and demonstrates that the two truth-seeking enterprises are engaged in analogous rational techniques of inquiry. His exploration of the deep connections between science and theology shows with new clarity a common kinship in the search for truth. The author identifies and explores key similarities in quantum physics and Christology. Among the many parallels he identifies are patterns of historical development in quantum physics and in Christology; wrestling with perplexities such as quantum interpretation and the problem of evil; and the drive for an overarching view in the Grand Unified Theories of physics and in Trinitarian theology. Both theology and science are propelled by a desire to understand the world through experienced reality, and Polkinghorne explains that their viewpoints are by no means mutually exclusive.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=X6eem8xQ3lEC&dq=Beaumarchais+in+Seville:+an+Intermezzo&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"I Sailed with Magellan","description":"Major new fiction from an acclaimed master From the prizewinning writer Stuart Dybek comes a superb new work: a novel-in-stories, eleven masterful tales told by a single voice with remarkable narrative power. In I Sailed With Magellan, Dybek finds characters of irrepressible vitality amidst the stark urban landscapes of Chicago's south side; there, the daily experiences of the neighborhood are transformed in the lush imaginative adventures of his hero, the restless Perry Katzek. There is remarkable music in each of Dybek's intertwined episodes, the rhythm of street life captured in all its emotional depth and unexpected humor: a man takes his young nephew to a string of taverns where the boy sings for his uncle's bourbon; a small-time thug is distracted from making a hit by the mysterious reappearance of several ex-girlfriends; two unemployed youths hatch a scheme to finance their road trip to Mexico by selling orchids stolen from the rich side of town; a young couple's amorous beach adventure is interrupted when an unexpected visitor washes ashore. As these poignant, often funny chapters unfold, Perry grapples toward the exotic possibilities the world offers him, glimpsing them even beneath the at times brutal surface of the inner-city. Throughout I Sailed With Magellan, fans of Dybek will find the captivating storytelling, the sharp, spare prose, the brilliant dramatization of resilient, inventive humanity that they have come to expect from him.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jqi013ec0oYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Starting Out:The Sicilian Dragon (Starting Out - Everyman Chess)","description":"Andrew Martin studies this famous opening in a simplistic way, introducing the crucial initial moves and ideas and taking care to explain the reasoning behind them, something that has sometimes been neglected or taken for granted.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=8q45HAAACAAJ&dq=Starting+Out:The+Sicilian+Dragon+(Starting+Out+-+Everyman+Chess)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Shadow King: A Novel","description":"SHORTLISTED FOR THE BOOKER PRIZE 2020 A BOOK OF THE YEAR IN THE NEW YORK TIMES, GUARDIAN, ELLE, TIME, SPECTATOR  DEVASTATING  Marlon James,  BRILLIANT  Salman Rushdie,  MAGNIFICENT  Aminatta Forna,  WONDERFUL  Laila Lalami,  UNFORGETTABLE  The Times,  REMARKABLE  New York Times Ethiopia, 1935.

I feel there were a lot of people just like me. We were faces in our windows, looking out, wondering what in the world is going on. We have some evil giants trying to stomp us down, and they are trying to turn our country into something we cannot accept. God is love, but He is not just soft, mushy, quiet love. God has a temper, and He has displayed it in His Word. The scolding poems (the face in the window poems) came to me in a basically complete form. To me, they were a gift. I barely changed a word or corrected any of them. It is okay for us to use righteous indignation to fight what is wrong. We are not doormats for someone to wipe their feet on. If someone is trying to walk all over you, pull yourself out from underneath them and knock them on their backsides. God uses tough love for correction and teaching. God will show His wrath when He is angered. He displays His righteous indignation. He offers the greatest love imaginable. He offers mercy and grace. Don t forget He has a sense of humor. God has a wide range of emotions and so do we. God loves America. God s love is alive. God loves to hear from us, and He is saying,  Where are you?  I love to write poems about God s love for us and my love for Him. Now it s 2021.

In particular, they typically have a narrow resource base and a fragile and often vulnerable natural environment. While there is some research on islands and small states, there is a dearth of information on the South Pacific and very little research is being undertaken in the region compared to other geographical regions in the world. This volume brings together current work in Pacific Island tourism. In this collection, three main themes arise: Images of the South Pacific; Socio-economic Impacts of Tourism; and Pacific Island Countries and the Outside World. The first focus is on the question of image, namely, stereotypes of a destination held by tourists and potential tourists, the extent to which residents, for their part, really welcome visitors, and the role tourism might play in changing pre-established images. The second theme is tourism's impacts, notably the economic and socio-cultural effects of international tourism's intrusion in the region which, though often hotly debated, have attracted relatively little empirical research. The third focus is on the challenges of how PICs articulate with their external geo-political and physical environment. These involve existing relations with formal colonial centres, geographical isolation, the need for greater air access to the outside world and for more tourists, and the continuing threat to several PICs of global warming, which increased air travel will inevitably exacerbate. This text will be of interest to tourism students, researchers and academics in the fields of tourism, development studies and cultural studies.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=L61JAQAACAAJ&dq=The+Pacific+Islands&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Legal Writing in Plain English: A Text With Exercises","description":"Admirably clear, concise, down-to-earth, and powerful-unfortunately, these adjectives rarely describe legal writing, whether in the form of briefs, opinions, contracts, or statutes. In Legal Writing in Plain English, Bryan A. Garner provides lawyers, judges, paralegals, law students, and legal scholars sound advice and practical tools for improving their written work. The book encourages legal writers to challenge conventions and offers valuable insights into the writing process: how to organize ideas, create and refine prose, and improve editing skills. In essence, it teaches straight thinking a skill inseparable from good writing. Replete with common sense and wit, the book draws on real-life writing samples that Garner has gathered through more than a decade of teaching in the field. Trenchant advice covers all types of legal materials, from analytical and persuasive writing to legal drafting. Meanwhile, Garner explores important aspects of document design. Basic, intermediate, and advanced exercises in each section reinforce the book's principles. (An answer key to basic exercises is included in the book; answers to intermediate and advanced exercises are provided in a separate Instructor's Manual, free of charge to instructors.) Appendixes include a comprehensive punctuation guide with advice and examples, and four model documents. Today more than ever before, legal professionals cannot afford to ignore the trend toward clear language shorn of jargon. Clients demand it, and courts reward it. Despite the age-old tradition of poor writing in law, Legal Writing in Plain English shows how legal writers can unshackle themselves. Legal Writing in Plain English includes: *Tips on generating thoughts, organizing them, and creating outlines. *Sound advice on expressing your ideas clearly and powerfully. *Dozens of real-life writing examples to illustrate writing problems and solutions. *Exercises to reinforce principles of good writing (also available on the Internet). *Helpful guidance on page layout. *A punctuation guide that shows the correct uses of every punctuation mark. *Model legal documents that demonstrate the power of plain English.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=reZf9nzoiSQC&dq=Legal+Writing+in+Plain+English:+A+Text+With+Exercises&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Milan Kundera's \\"The Unbearable Lightness of Being\\": A Study Guide from Gale's \\"Novels for Students\\" (Volume 18, Chapter 9)","description":"Een Tsjechische vluchtelinge denkt terug aan haar leven in Praag.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=x1TCAAAACAAJ&dq=Milan+Kundera%27s+%22The+Unbearable+Lightness+of+Being%22:+A+Study+Guide+from+Gale%27s+%22Novels+for+Students%22+(Volume+18,+Chapter+9)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Not Quite Dead Enough","description":"The army wants Nero Wolfe urgently, but he refuses their clarion call to duty.

A.D. 1037) was known in the West by his Latinized name Avicenna. An analysis of the sources and evolution of Avicenna's metaphysics, this book focuses on the answers he and his predecessors gave to two fundamental pairs of questions: what is the soul and how does it cause the body; and what is God and how does He cause the world? To respond to these challenges, Avicenna invented new concepts and distinctions and reinterpreted old ones. The author concludes that Avicenna's innovations are a turning point in the history of metaphysics. Avicenna's metaphysics is the culmination of a period of synthesis during which philosophers fused together a Neoplatonic project (reconciling Plato with Aristotle) with a Peripatetic project (reconciling Aristotle with himself). Avicenna also stands at the beginning of a period during which philosophers sought to integrate the Arabic version of the earlier synthesis with Islamic doctrinal theology (kalam). Avicenna's metaphysics significantly influenced European scholastic thought, but it had an even more profound impact on Islamic intellectual history the philosophical problems and opportunities associated with the Avicennian synthesis continued to be debated up to the end of the nineteenth century.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=pblcDwAAQBAJ&dq=Avicenna%27s+Metaphysics+in+Context&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How Wall Street Created a Nation: J.P.

But what about the company that is not born with great DNA? How can good companies, mediocre companies, even bad companies achieve enduring greatness? The Study For years, this question preyed on the mind of Jim Collins. Are there companies that defy gravity and convert long-term mediocrity or worse into long-term superiority? And if so, what are the universal distinguishing characteristics that cause a company to go from good to great? The Standards Using tough benchmarks, Collins and his research team identified a set of elite companies that made the leap to great results and sustained those results for at least fifteen years. How great? After the leap, the good-to-great companies generated cumulative stock returns that beat the general stock market by an average of seven times in fifteen years, better than twice the results delivered by a composite index of the world's greatest companies, including Coca-Cola, Intel, General Electric, and Merck. The Comparisons The research team contrasted the good-to-great companies with a carefully selected set of comparison companies that failed to make the leap from good to great. What was different? Why did one set of companies become truly great performers while the other set remained only good? Over five years, the team analyzed the histories of all twenty-eight companies in the study. After sifting through mountains of data and thousands of pages of interviews, Collins and his crew discovered the key determinants of greatness -- why some companies make the leap and others don't. The Findings The findings of the Good to Great study will surprise many readers and shed light on virtually every area of management strategy and practice. The findings include: Level 5 Leaders: The research team was shocked to discover the type of leadership required to achieve greatness. The Hedgehog Concept (Simplicity within the Three Circles): To go from good to great requires transcending the curse of competence. A Culture of Discipline: When you combine a culture of discipline with an ethic of entrepreneurship, you get the magical alchemy of great results. Technology Accelerators: Good-to-great companies think differently about the role of technology. The Flywheel and the Doom Loop: Those who launch radical change programs and wrenching restructurings will almost certainly fail to make the leap.  Some of the key concepts discerned in the study,  comments Jim Collins, \\"fly in the face of our modern business culture and will, quite frankly, upset some people.  Perhaps, but who can afford to ignore these findings?","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=T2BZz8FmCt8C&dq=Discussion+Guide:+Jim+Collins%27+Good+To+Great+--+The+Book+That+Followed+Built+To+Last&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"William Shakespeare: Sonnets","description":"A bestselling, beautifully designed edition of William Shakespeare s sonnets and poems, complete with valuable tools for educators.

It is like a coffin crowned with flowers; a death trap baited with roses. Writing under the pseudonym Catharine Cole, Martha R. Field (1855-1898) became the first full-time newswoman for the New Orleans Daily Picayune in 1881. For more than a decade she was the woman's page editor and wrote a Sunday column, Catharine Cole's Letter, that established her as one of the most popular writers in the South. Cole wrote fiction, essays, editorials on women's issues, and travel pieces. But her accounts of journeys through Louisiana's rural parishes by rail, steamboat, carriage, buggy, and on foot brought her writing to the state's working men and women as well as its plantation aristocracy. Louisiana Voyages: The Travel Writings of Catharine Cole gathers these travel writings for the first time. Touring most of Louisiana's parishes, taking in New Orleans, Baton Rouge, Shreveport, Lafayette, Morgan City, and Grand Isle, Cole revealed in her journalism much about an exotic, unspoiled Louisiana and the Gilded Age South as a whole. A punishing 1,800-mile buggy trip through forests, swamps, bayous, and along the Gulf Coast made her a celebrity writer who, according to her contemporaries, knew more about Louisiana than any other person alive.

Extending a centuries-old tradition made popular in the studios of Ehret and Redoute, Ms. Grierson combines the artist's eye for beauty and balance with the botanist's need for accuracy. Native plants of Hawaii are a primary focus of this volume and the reason the Garden invited Ms. Grierson to Kauai for five working visits in the 1970s and 1980s. But the collection also reflects the Hawaiian landscape seen by contemporary residents and visitors alike - with Polynesian and modern agricultural and ornamental plant immigrants now competing with the natives for attention and for space. With his general introduction to the flora of Hawaii and in accompaniments to each painting, botanist Peter Green narrates the interaction of plants and people - through the ethnobotany and legends of the early Hawaiians, the taxonomic research of botanists past and present, and the history that brought such an incredible mix of species to the Islands. A central theme is the interaction of native and introduced plants, with its warnings about the loss of Hawaii's unique natural heritage. A Hawaiian Florilegium is a convergence of fine art, scientific illustration, and botanical history.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ie86AQAAIAAJ&dq=A+Hawaiian+Florilegium:+Botanical+Portraits+from+Paradise&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"On The Far Side Of The Mountain","description":"Sam's peaceful existence in his wilderness home is disrupted when his sister runs away and his pet falcon is confiscated by a conservation officer.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=NY15YFIVKtgC&dq=On+The+Far+Side+Of+The+Mountain&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Flash: Race Against Time","description":"As Wally West spirals through time fighting evil and trying to return to the present, he is replaced by time-traveler John Fox, who seeks to take both Wally's role as the Flash and his girlfriend, Linda Park.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ASsVRAAACAAJ&dq=The+Flash:+Race+Against+Time&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Autobiography of Abbie Hoffman 2 Ed","description":"Linking the events of Hoffman's personal life with the political and social climate of the 1960s and beyond, an engrossing biography of Abbie Hoffman recreates the complexities of his life and his role as an activist, from the perspective of his younger brother.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ozC7AAAAIAAJ&dq=Autobiography+of+Abbie+Hoffman+2+Ed&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Corvette Restoration Guide, 1968-1982 (Motorbooks Workshop)","description":"Third generation Corvettes (19681982), commonly known as C3s, are among the most plentiful and affordable Corvettes on the road today.

In particular, it examines the role played by the East German church in that country's bloodless revolution. Although some scholars and political commentators have noted that the East German church provided a free space in which dissident groups could meet, they have neither described nor assessed the theology that guided the church's political involvement. Drawing on his own research in East Germany and relying primarily on sources published in East Germany itself, John Burgess demonstrates the roots of the church's theology in Barth, Bonhoeffer, and in the Barmen declaration, which in 1934 pronounced Christianity and Nazi ideology to be incompatible. He explores how the dissident groups drew on church symbols and language to develop a popular alternative theology, and finally shows how the theological tension between the church and the dissidents provided impulses for political democratization.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=yElkgtDETocC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Children Are from Heaven : Positive Parenting Skills for Raising Cooperative, Confident, and Compassionate Children","description":"A new book about parenting from the prolific author of Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus John Gray's Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus is a history-making bestseller with more than 7 million copies in print in hardcover.

In the case of Fukuyama's work, the central hypothesis and explanation he put forward were not, in fact, new, but they were novel in the academic and historical context of the time. Fukuyama's central argument was that the end of the Cold War was a symptom of, and a vital waypoint in, a teleological progression of history. Interpreting history as \\"teleological\\" is to say that it is headed towards a final state, or end point: a state in which matters will reach an equilibrium in which things are as good as they can get. For Fukuyama, this would mean the end of \\"mankind's ideological evolution and the universalization of Western liberal democracy as the final form of human government.\\" This grand theory, which sought to explain the end of the Cold War through a single overarching hypothesis, made the novel step of resurrecting the German philosopher G.W.F. Hegel's theory of history - which had long been ignored by practical historians and political philosophers - and applying it to current events.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=kEkrDwAAQBAJ&dq=The+End+of+History+and+the+Last+Man&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dynamic thought, or, The law of vibrant energy","description":"\\"Dynamic Thought; Or, The Law of Vibrant Energy\\" by William Walker Atkinson is a book about the odd union of ancient occult teachings to the most advanced and latest concepts of modern science.

James Fennell, the photographer of this volume and its Scottish and Irish companions, has once again provided a wealth of gardens, charming interiors, bygone sporting trophies, fine art collections, and fanciful family memorabilia, making The English Country House a delicious treat for Anglophiles and lovers of old houses. \\"--","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ZkJylwEACAAJ&dq=House+in+the+Country&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"50 hikes in Mount Rainier National Park","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=SyJsOLnUkdQC&dq=50+hikes+in+Mount+Rainier+National+Park&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Learning SolidWorks","description":"This book will teach you everything you need to know to start using SOLIDWORKS 2020 with easy to understand, step-by-step tutorials.

You will start by learning to model simple robot parts and before long you will graduate to creating more complex parts and multi-view drawings. Along the way you will learn the fundamentals of parametric modeling through the use of geometric constraints and relationships. You will also become familiar with many of SOLIDWORKS's powerful tools and commands that enable you to easily construct complex features in your models. Also included is coverage of gears, gear trains and spur gear creation using SOLIDWORKS. This book continues by examining the different mechanisms commonly used in walking robots. You will learn the basic types of planar four-bar linkages commonly used in mechanical designs and how to use the GeoGebra Dynamic Geometry software to simulate and analyze 2D linkages. Using the knowledge you gained about linkages and mechanisms, you will learn how to modify your robot and change its behavior by modifying or creating new parts. In the second to last chapter of this book you learn how to combine all the robot parts into assemblies and then run motion analysis. You will finish off your project by creating 3D animations of your robot in action. Finally, in the last chapter, the author introduces you to 3D printing. You will learn the general principles of 3D printing including a brief history of 3D printing, the types of 3D printing technologies, commonly used filaments, and the basic procedure for printing a 3D model. Being able to turn your designs into physical objects will open up a whole new world of possibilities to you. There are many books that show you how to perform individual tasks with SOLIDWORKS, but this book takes you through an entire project and shows you the complete engineering process.

Outside public scrutiny or Parliamentary review and frequently acting at the behest of U.S. and U.K. intelligence agencies. Canada has been spying electronically from its embassies in capitals as far-flung as Moscow, New Delhi, Bucharest, Rabat and Caracas. It has then shared the results with its allies. There is every reason to believe Canada is still doing \\"embassy collection\\" today. Techniques developed during the \\"Cold War\\" have been honed for political and economic espionage in the nineties.\\" \\"The agency responsible is the top-secret Communications Security Establishment (CSE) of whose existence most Canadians are unaware. CSE has also used sophisticated equipment, much of it provided by the U.S., to listen in on Canadian and on American citizens, raising vital questions about civil liberties and the invasion of privacy. It has intercepted communications from the Soviet embassy in Ottawa; from British cabinet ministers; from the governments of France and Quebec; from suspected Sikh terrorists in India; and from the Kremlin. Its record is impressive: if it wants to, it can intercept almost any phone, fax or radiowave transmission.\\" \\"How do we know all this? Because one man, Mike Frost, a communications officer at CSE for nineteen years, has decided that in the post-\\"Cold War\\" era it is time for the Canadian public to be told what its government has been doing and for a public debate to ensue.\\" \\"As he tells the story of his career, he paints a remarkable picture of the Security Establishments of Canada, the U.S. and the U.K. The Americans in particular are revealed as possessing high-tech wizardry that they use for political and economic spying - including, according to Frost, highly controversial spying on the Canadian government. Much of Canada's spying from 1972 to 1990 was undertaken for the Americans. Frost and his immediate boss were at the centre of the \\"embassy-collection\\" scheme, which was code-named \\"Project Pilgrim\\". The story of how \\"Pilgrim\\" grew by trial and error into a highly successful operation is full of drama, comedy, triumphs and frustrations.\\" \\"Frost is proud of the achievements, but the questionable aspects of CSE's activities have led him to go public on both CSE's successes and its excesses. While scrupulously careful about not jeopardizing national security or endangering the lives of agents in the field, he nonetheless reveals an institution whose powers are potentially so great that they need to be subject to Parliamentary control and public scrutiny.

It's also the first to provide a proven, step-by-step health program to help the millions of people with diabetes manage their disease. Until now, this life-changing program was available only to patients at Duke University Medical Center, but The Mind-Body Diabetes Revolution makes it available to everyone who needs it -- diabetic people and the millions at risk for developing the disease. Over the past forty years, little has changed in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Diet, exercise, and medication are still the three primary methods used to control blood sugar. Yet diabetes is reaching epidemic proportions not just in the United States, but also in other countries all over the world. Now, after twenty years of research, Dr. Richard S. Surwit -- a leader in the field of the psychology of diabetes -- adds the vital fourth component to treating diabetes: a revolutionary mind-body program that lowers blood sugar levels and dramatically reduces the disease's serious, damaging side effects, which can include painful nerve damage, heart disease, impotence, eye problems, and kidney ailments. The Mind-Body Diabetes Revolution explains how thoughts and beliefs influence a person's emotions and moods and shows how these can translate into chronic anger, cynicism, anxiety, and depression -- all of which increase your blood sugar level. But, with compelling case studies and a powerfully effective step-by-step six-week program, Dr. Surwit demonstrates how you can learn to manage the emotions and stress that lead to elevated hormones and higher blood sugar levels. After he explains the mind-metabolism connection so that you see how it works in your own body, Dr. Surwit provides self-tests and reflective quizzes to test your personality type and decide on the best -- and easiest -- psychological techniques to help you lower your blood sugar level, and keep it low. Then he helps you develop the best long-term mind-body program for your needs and shows how to use the planner to keep track of your progress. An invaluable aid to your overall well-being, The Mind-Body Diabetes Revolution helps you enlist your own mind and body as powerful allies in controlling your diabetes, and enjoy greater general health as a result.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=fYTVcki6vIEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Arc Welding Instructions for the Beginner","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=HOFSAAAAMAAJ&dq=Arc+Welding+Instructions+for+the+Beginner&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Meet the Monsters","description":"Monstersitters Esme and Roy are the best pair in little monster care!

But behind the lush vineyards and majestic estate house, the Hollander family fortunes have suffered and the threat of a sale brings old wounds to the surface. For matriarch Vivian, she fears that this summer season could be their last and that selling their winery to strangers could expose a dark secret she's harbored for decades. Meanwhile, her daughter, Leah, who was turned away from the business years ago, finds her marriage at a crossroads and returns home for a sorely needed escape. And granddaughter Sadie, grappling with a crisis of her own, runs to the vineyard looking for inspiration. But when Sadie uncovers journals from Vivian's old book club dedicated to scandalous novels of decades past, she realizes that this might be the distraction they all need.

This book explores the myriad dimensions of the Iranian-Russian encounter during a dramatic period which saw both Iran and Russia subject to revolutionary upheavals and transformed from multinational dynastic empires typical of the nineteenth century to modernizing, authoritarian states typical of the twentieth. The collection provides a fresh perspective on traditional preoccupations of international relations: wars and diplomacy, the hostility of opposing nationalisms, the Russian imperial menace in the nineteenth century and the Soviet threat in the twentieth. Going beyond the traditional, this book examines subaltern as well as elite relations and combines a cultural, social and intellectual dimension with the political and diplomatic. In doing so the book seeks to construct a new discourse which contests the notion of an implacable enmity between Iran and Russia Bringing together leading scholars in the field, this book demonstrates extensive use of family archives, Iranian, Russian and Caucasian travelogues and memoirs, and newly available archives in both Iran and the countries of the former Soviet Union. Providing essential background to current international tensions, this book will be of particular use to students and scholars with an interest in the Middle East and Russia.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=VCTipPJdKBwC&dq=After+the+Russians&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cowboy Boots","description":"A collectible and fun little book on America's most fashionable footwear, the Small Boot Book is a close up look at the veritable trunk show of some of the most impressive cowboy boot designs from the most prestigious and famed bootmakers in the world, and is small and handy enough to carry with you when you're shopping for that next pair!

This fact is fundamental to organizations whose leaders must often make crucial decisions: to do this they need the best available insights. In Judgment Calls, authors Tom Davenport and Brook Manville share twelve stories of organizations that have successfully tapped their data assets, diverse perspectives, and deep knowledge to build an organizational decision-making capability a competence they say can make the difference between success and failure. This book introduces a model that taps the collective judgment of an organization so that the right decisions are made, and the entire organization profits. Through the stories in Judgment Calls, the authors both of them seasoned management thinkers and advisers make the case for the wisdom of organizations and suggest ways to use it to best advantage. Each chapter tells a unique story of one dilemma and its ultimate resolution, bringing into high relief one key to the power of collective judgment. Individually, these stories inspire and instruct; together, they form a model for building an organizational capacity for broadly based, knowledge-intensive decision making.

One of the 172 copies then printed by him has been used as \\"copy\\" for the printer, but this has been revised in proof from the British Museum examples of the second edition of 1575. The collation has for the most part only served to confirm Haslewood's reputation for careful editing. Though the present edition can claim to come nearer the original in many thousands of passages, it is chiefly in the mint and cummin of capitals and italics that we have been able to improve on Haslewood: in all the weightier matters of editing he shows only the minimum of fallibility. We have however divided his two tomes, for greater convenience, into three volumes of as nearly as possible equal size. This arrangement has enabled us to give the title pages of both editions of the two tomes, those of the first edition in facsimile, those of the second (at the beginning of vols. ii. and iii.) with as near an approach to the original as modern founts of type will permit. I have also reprinted Haslewood's \\"Preliminary Matter,\\" which give the Dryasdust details about the biography of Painter and the bibliography of his book in a manner not too Dryasdust.

This book will help you develop the faith and prayer life that God desires for you. What if your communication with God became as vibrant as the interaction between you and your best friend? What if God literally responded to your praise, your worship, and your requests? This is absolutely God's will for your prayer life! For many, prayer is only a matter of blessing their food, asking for help during a crisis, or whispering a need when they feel they are at the end of their rope. Unfortunately, this barely scratches the surface of the prayer life God wants to share with us. In Prayer That Changes Everything, Mary Colbert unpacks five principles to revolutionize readers' faith and help them experience the full dimension of the relationship they can have with God through prayer. She challenges readers to: Recognize that faith is alive and must be in action Live with a faith that excites God Realize that faith is the substance of all things See the thing they want God to do as done and begin to praise Him for it; and know that love is the fuel Whether a new believer or a longtime Christian, each reader will find accessible, fresh insights into prayer and practical wisdom that will revitalize his or her prayer life and transform his or her relationship with God.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Zi3RDwAAQBAJ&dq=Prayers+To+She+Who+Is&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Then Will Come Night and Darkness","description":"It's Finally Available!

The hardening of the heart is quite simply God's disciplinary punishment for the specific sin of idolatry. Meadors' book is an exercise in biblical theology. Beginning in the Hebrew Bible the hardened heart finds rescue in the \\"new covenant\\" promises that Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Hosea prophesy. In these prohecies God promises to remove Israel's idols, cleanse the people, anoint them with God's spirit, write God's law upon their hearts, and turn the people's hearts of stone into hearts of flesh. The New Testament tells how Jesus of Nazareth activates these promises and brings them into effect in the lives of those who respond to him in faith. Paul preaches this message as well, and the book of Revelation applies this message to the historical context of the seven churches of Asia Minor, who lived with the agonizing temptation to compromise with the idolatry-laden Roman emperor cult. Meadors examines the biblical rationale for idolatry and the hardening of the heart as it unfolds in specific passages--Lev. 26, Dt. 29, Ps. 115, 135--and examines the phenomenon through the rest of the Hebrew Bible, the Gospels, the letters of Paul, and Revelation.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=v6ZLnwEACAAJ&dq=Idolatry+and+the+Hardening+of+the+Heart:+A+Study+in+Biblical+Theology&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Confessions of a Medical Heretic","description":"Revealing that modern medicine's methods are often more dangerous than the diseases they are designed to diagnose and treat, Dr. Mendelsohn explains the risks of annual physical examinations, drugs, and unnecessary surgery, and compares home and hospitalbirths","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=7uhW15eVrs8C&dq=Confessions+of+a+Medical+Heretic&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Gospel of St. Mark (Pelican New Testament commentaries)","description":"Saint Mark's Gospel is generally agreed to be the primary source for the life of Jesus - both Matthew and Luke drew on his account when they were writing their own.

It is in the surprising and revealing links between them--links pertaining to troublesome mothers, elusive foreign languages, and professional disappointments--that Barbara Johnson maps the coordinates of her larger claims about the ideal of oneness in every area of life, and about the damage done by this ideal. The existence of sexual difference precludes an original or ultimate \\"one\\" who would represent all of mankind; the plurality of languages makes it impossible to think that one doesn't live in translation; and the plurality of the sexes means that every human being came from a woman's body, and some will reproduce this feat, while others won't. In her most personal and deeply considered book about difference, Johnson asks: Is the mother the guardian of a oneness we have never had? The relations that link mothers, bodies, words, and laws serve as the guiding puzzles as she searches for an answer.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=UhNtrP0aplkC&dq=Mother+Tongues:+Sexuality,+Trials,+Motherhood,+Translation&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Grandpa Loves","description":"Celebrate the love between grandpas and grandchildren in this heartwarming title by bestselling author, Marianne Richmond!

Sportsman, adventurer, raconteur par excellence, Capstick has been recognized as a modern-day master of African hunting literature a successor to the works of Hemingway and Robert Ruark. Capstick has written post facto about classic hunters of the past and safaris in which he participated as a professional hunter in such books as Death in the Silent Places and Death in the Dark Continent. Now, he presents an enthralling tale of an entirely new safari, an exciting first-person adventure of his own dangerous and very personal excursion. The result is a definitive work on African hunting, and one of his greatest achievements. In 1985, Capstick went back into the African bush with two top photographers and a crack professional hunter. It was a venture taken for personal challenge, and for the chance to look anew at what had become of the Africa immortalized in his own earlier works. Peter Capstick s Africa: A Return to the Long Grass is the chronicle, in text and pictures, of this safari. It is full of the same edge-of-the-seat narration, witty anecdotes, and wry observations that have made Capstick s earlier books so popular. The text of the book has been integrated with the photographs of Paul Kimble and Dick van Niekerk into a lavish full-color production that illustrates Capstick s narrative in a way his fans have never seen before.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=fLgYDayd8-gC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Covenant of The Crown","description":"THE SHADDAN CROWN IS THE KEY TO POWER -- AND THE KLINGONS HAVE THE ADVANTAGE!

The Confessions of Nat Turner is William Styron s complex and richly drawn imagining of Nat Turner, the leader of the 1831 slave rebellion in Virginia that led to the deaths of almost sixty men, women, and children. Published at the height of the civil rights movement, the novel draws upon the historical Nat Turner s confession to his attorney, made as he awaited execution in a Virginia jail.

Nat Turner is a galvanizing portrayal of the crushing institution of slavery, and Styron s deeply layered characterization is a stunning rendering of one man s violent struggle against oppression.

So when an elderly but surprisingly childlike woman calling herself Shirley shows up on Lucy's doorstep looking for her mama, Lucy thinks it must be another of her friend Ellis's pranks. But Ellis doesn't know a thing about it, and what's more, the two suspect the woman might be Ellis's cousin, Florence, who disappeared as a child more than fifty years earlier. When the mysterious woman vanishes from Lucy's house, she and Ellis don't know what to think. And considering that Calpernia Hemphill, the town's theater and music aficionado, has just been found dead of an apparent fall from the tower at Bertram's Folly, life in Stone's Throw suddenly seems less safe than sinister. Luckily, guardian angel Augusta Goodnight shows up to calm Lucy's nerves (with a basket of strawberry muffins, of course). And not a moment too soon, because Shirley/Florence is found dead at the bottom of a steep flight of steps in the parking lot behind the Methodist church. She is not the last victim, and Ellis, whose inheritance could be threatened by the reappearance of her long-lost cousin, remains the number-one suspect. Augusta, Lucy, and the Thursday Morning Literary Society (which now meets on Monday afternoons) must use their heads---and a little bit of home cooking---to solve the mystery.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=fV_2K6XSxzEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Piper Aircraft - The Development and History of Piper Designs","description":"The first-ever authoritative history of the business of general aviation: the triumphs and defeats, mergers and acquisitions.

Carter changes the course of a century of psychological theory, practice, and education. He debunks the traditional belief that race has a marginal impact on personality development and, with compelling empirical evidence, demonstrates that race is the defining factor above other experiences of living in the United States and a crucial ingredient in the therapeutic process. Carter presents models of racial identity for all racial groups and offers numerous case studies of various psychosocial resolutions within racial groups. He constructs the first racially inclusive model of psychotherapy--a rigorous conceptual framework that affords clinicians a deeper awareness of how racial issues affect their dealings with patients--and creates a means of integrating that knowledge into their practices. The Influence of Race and Racial Identity in Psychotherapy: * Defines the decisive role of racial identity in personality development * Presents a racially inclusive model of psychotherapy * Describes how this model is applied in a clinical context * Proposes new counselor training programs based on this model. This immensely valuable text helps students in multicultural counseling and psychotherapy develop an awareness of their own levels of racial identity as well as those of their patients. For practicing therapists, it opens new vistas in the therapeutic process and provides new avenues through which to better understand and serve their patients.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=uO9MVtggWucC&dq=The+Influence+of+Race+and+Racial+Identity+in+Psychotherapy:+Toward+a+Racially+Inclusive+Model&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"La Voie Royale","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=R367xQEACAAJ&dq=La+Voie+Royale&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sweet Expectations: Michele Hoskins' Recipe for Success","description":"Presents the life of Michele Hoskins, an African American businesswoman who overcame physical and financial hardship to become the successful owner of a multimillion-dollar food company.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=GNF5OGRb3LIC&dq=Sweet+Expectations:+Michele+Hoskins%27+Recipe+for+Success&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The mystery of Morgan Castle (The Morgan Bay mysteries)","description":"The Morgan Bay Mysteries.

Bold in its historical scope, rich in colorful settings, and eminently readable, Confessions of Madame Psyche also reaches inward, toward quieter truths. A A A The novel is narrated by Mei0li Murrow, born in San Francisco in 1895, the illegitimate daughter of a charismatic confidence man and the Chinese prostitute he has \\"rescued\\" from the streets. After her mother's early death, Mei-li is left to care of her mercenary half-sister Erika. When the young Mei-li, by pure coincidence, predicts the San Francisco earthquake of 1906, Erika contructs her identity as \\"Madame Psyche\\"-exploiting Mei'li's exoticism and her clients' yearnings for contact with the dead in a series of ingeniously orchestrated seances that win her renown as a medium in California and then in the death-soaked Europe of the First World War. A A A Ironically, it is when she manages to finally reject the popular \\"spirituality\\" that has made her famous that Mei-li experiences a truer spiritual vision: One day, while walking on the beach, she has a revelation of her connection to all of life-\\"an experience of hidden reality which I have never doubted...and which left me permanently changed by what I then knew and know still and will always know.\\" A A A Mei-li's subsequent journey leads her through the aspirations and disappointments of a utopian commune in the Santa Cruz Mountains in the 1920s; to the poverty of migrant work camps in the Depression-era Salinas Valley; and to the courage of the first strikes on San Jose's cannery row. Finally, when the relentless Erika cheats her out of an inheritance by having her committed to the Napa State Hospital, Mee-li finds her greatest wisdom and peace among the outcasts of the asylum-and there writes her \\"confessions.\\" A A A Mei'li's story is ensconed in the rich history of Northern California in the first half of the twentieth century, and peopled by comrades of many classes and cultures and lovers both male and female; but her central odyssey remains one of inner discovery. In Confessions of Madame Psyche, Dorothy Bryant has created a character who is so honest in her search for truth, growth, and spiritual understanding that this quest becomes inherent to her survival.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=YEM6Rx2ouiMC&dq=Confessions+of+Madame+Psyche+:+memoirs+and+letters+of+Mei-li+Murrow&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Handbook Of Oncology Nursing","description":"This completely revised edition continues to reflect information about the treatment of cancer, oncologic emergencies, and common clinical problems.

A court battle ensued between her family and her lover, Karen Thompson, whose attempt to file for guardianship and subsequent appeals were thwarted despite conclusive evidence as to the nature of the women's relationship. The book demonstrates that the courts ignored affidavits by therapists who witnessed Thompson's determination in rehabilitating Kowalski, yet allowed into evidence one doctor's out-of-court deposition asserting that the patient would be exposed 'to a high risk of sexual abuse' if Thompson were allowed to visit. Chronicling Thompson's uphill struggle against the sexism and homophobia that permeate this country's institutions, this controversial work reveals one woman's personal journey from closeted lesbian to feminist activist while reconciling her Christian beliefs with her own sexuality.

But something about Sue Ellen and Cindy Lou compels him. Maybe it s the way Cindy Lou speaks to him, or how Sue Ellen sits on her bike. Whatever the reason, he follows the girls into the woods.

Forty years later, a nephew of Linus s returns to South Carolina, curious about this dark moment in his family s past. To find the fourth person who visited the clearing that day means reopening a sinister chapter of the small town s history, which certain evil men had thought closed forever. Carolina Skeletons is based on the 1944 case of George Stinney Jr., who, at the age of fourteen, became the youngest person executed in the United States during the twentieth century.

This essay collection divines the prospects of fiction in the information age by examining cyberpunk literature. A movement less than a decade old, cyberpunk is driven by deep concerns about society, ethics, and new technology and has been defined as the literature of the first generation of science-fiction writers actually to live in a science-fiction world. These essays were first presented at the 1989 annual J. Lloyd Eaton Conference on Science Fiction and Fantasy Literature, the field's most prestigious international gathering. They address concerns common not only to cyberpunk and traditional science-fiction scholars, critics, and writers but to their counterparts outside the genre as well. Interdisciplinary in perspective, the essays consider the origins of cyberpunk, the appropriation of its conventions by the mass media, the literature's paradoxical retrogressive/iconoclastic nature, cyberpunk's affinities to and deviations from both traditional science fiction and postmodernist literature, the parameters and components of the cyberpunk canon, and the movement's future course. Some essays are theoretical, but all are grounded in works familiar to serious science-fiction readers: Neuromancer, Frontera, Deserted Cities of the Heart, Islands in the Net, Great Sky River, the Mirrorshades anthology, and others; cyberpunk TV and cinema like the Max Headroom programs, Blade Runner, and Tron; and precursory literature, including Frankenstein, Le Roman de l'avenir, Ralph I24C 41 +, and A Clockwork Orange. Useful for its views on a volatile science-fiction subgenre, Fiction 2000 is also valuable for what it tells us about the fate of mainstream literature.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=jIOa_XhDNLMC&dq=A+Handbook+for+Visitors+from+Outer+Space&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"First Aid for Cats: An Owner's Guide to a Happy Healthy Pet","description":"Do you know what to do if your cat breaks his leg?

Whether we are in the early, middle, or latter part of our personal faith story, the ending is still ahead of us and reviewing our own faith story helps us chart our course into the future. Using psychologist Dan McAdams s idea that we make sense of life by composing our own life story, author Bradley Hanson explores how our personal identity and spirituality are influenced by the meaning and values embedded in our childhood family life and major story lines promoted by our culture. In our most basic quest to make sense of life, he considers sharply contrasting answers to five fundamental questions. With reflection and suggested group discussion questions at the end of each chapter, this study explores the idea that spirituality and one s life story are intimately connected. Praise for Spirituality and Your Life Story  Real people tell their stories of success, love, friendship, forgiveness, and loss. Brad Hanson helps us ponder our own deepest commitments and the paths we follow to realize them. A fine book for individual reflection or group discussion.   H.

Since the crime and the punishment come as a 'package deal' this book looks at both the legal nature of the offence and at the current operation of the mandatory life sentence. Not only does the book adopt a critical approach, by assessing the strengths and weaknesses of the status quo, it also draws upon comparative material from both common and civil law jurisdictions in an attempt to provide a comprehensive exploration of these issues. The need for public confidence in the criminal justice system is particularly acute in the way it deals with the most serious homicides. In this book the authors report findings from the first systematic exploration of public attitudes to sentencing murder in this or any other common law jurisdiction. The picture of public opinion emerging from this recent large-scale nationwide qualitative and quantitative survey, funded by the Nuffield Foundation, is likely to surprise many, and will be of interest to all jurisdictions where the mandatory life sentence for murder has been questioned.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=d4LbBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Amadeus Book of the Violin: Construction History and Music","description":"THE AMADEUS BOOK OF THE VIOLIN CONSTRUCTION HISTORY AND MUSIC","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=8QQJAQAAMAAJ&dq=The+Amadeus+Book+of+the+Violin:+Construction+History+and+Music&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Dialogical Imperative: A Christian Reflection on Interfaith Encounter (Faith Meets Faith Series)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=svwQAQAAIAAJ&dq=The+Dialogical+Imperative:+A+Christian+Reflection+on+Interfaith+Encounter+(Faith+Meets+Faith+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"When Dinosaurs Go Visiting","description":"When dinosaurs go visiting, they wear their nicest clothes.

Yet it still presents important political, epistemological, methodological and theoretical challenges. A sociolinguistics of development, in which the revitalization of linguistic communities is the priority, opens new perspectives for the emerging field of linguistic documentation, in which the societal aspects of research, stressed by sociolinguistics, have frequently been marginal. The need to focus on the documentation of linguistic communities to contribute to the revitalization of these communities requires an in-depth revision of a number of different perspectives. Especially regarding the links between commonly separated fields of enquiry such as sociolinguistics, documentation and revitalization. Instead of creating mere museum pieces of academic contemplation for the future, as has been the major trend up to now in language documentation and even sociolinguistics, there is a growing concern to join forces to revitalize the actual use of endangered languages in order to place languages as a main focus of a community s development which constitutes a major challenge for both scholars, civil society and speakers alike.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=S9F3EsZImesC&dq=Language+Endangerment+and+Language+Revitalization+(Trends+in+Linguistics)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Last Tasmanian Tiger: The History and Extinction of the Thylacine","description":"This insightful examination of the history and extinction of one of Australia's most enduring folkloric beasts--the thylacine, (or Tasmanian tiger)-- challenges conventional theories.

Cursive uses the hand muscles in a different way. Moreover, it activates a different part of the brain which regular writing does not use. Analysis shows that learning to use cursive writing advances students' motor and visual skills. Exercising cursive handwriting augments and develops dexterity in our fingers and hands. These skills are the ones which are required of a dentist, artist, surgeon, and computer technicians. Cursive also promotes our hand-eye coordination and the linkage between our brain and hand. Even more remarkable is the fact that learning to use cursive writing productively affects mind development. Research also indicates that the kids who learn cursive in addition to manuscript writing have higher grades on both spelling/writing and reading exams, conceivably because the linked-up style of cursive writing compels writers to think of words as wholes rather than parts. Students with learning difficulties Students with learning difficulties e.g., dyslexia, may have a hard time with print writing since many of the letters are similar in appearance, especially b and d. On the other hand, cursive letters look very different from their print counterparts. This gives dyslexic students another choice, which can reduce their dyslexic impulses and make them more confident in their capabilities. Cognitive skills and natural flow The flow of cursive writing comes much more naturally to children as compared to print writing and engages greater cognitive skills. This cognitive development helps students reason, problem solve, conceptualize and make decisions as they get older. Cursive writing progresses fine motor skills such as coordination, development of muscles and hand-eye synchronization. Additionally, cursive writing's letter strokes aid in the eyes' left-to-right reading motion. Cursive is also productive for note-taking because a word in cursive is one entire block, instead of a stop-and-start series of strokes. This productive and efficient way of taking notes assists students in grasping information greater than typing. The phrase we all have been using, \\"Write it down or you'll forget it,\\" is very true. Scientific studies on Neuropsychology suggest that the act of listening and handwriting links the verbal and spatial processing regions of the brain, strengthening memory. The overall excellence of syntax and writing is improved by this ability to reconstruct thought, ideas and lectures into written words, contrasted to those who type.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=VLsLuwEACAAJ&dq=I+Can+Practice+Writing+Cursive&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Doctor Who: Timelash (Doctor Who Library)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=cctsLwAACAAJ&dq=Doctor+Who:+Timelash+(Doctor+Who+Library)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"An Introduction to Qualitative Research","description":"'The fourth edition of Uwe Flick's Introduction to Qualitative Research remains the most comprehensive and thorough text in qualitative research.

A few years ago, customs officers at the border were meticulously checking goods and documents before releasing a shipment to the trader. A business could be confident that a shipment that had cleared customs complied with all applicable regulations. Today, to reduce congestion and give the trade quick access to their goods, customs have introduced risk management principles and a large number of shipments clear customs automatically. Controls have moved from the border to the trader s premises and it is during site visits that customs officers check the business compliance records. Moving from frontier checks to audit based controls has transferred a high level of responsibility and risk to the trader. It is now the duty of the trader to identify and report any error or irregularity and to keep an impeccable audit trail from initial quotation to receipt of payment. For the business, failing to provide satisfactory compliance records will result in delayed shipments and serious disruption in the supply chain. This will in turn impact on financial performance indicators such as Days in Inventory, Days Sales Outstanding and of course Cash Flow. The business will also have to endure in depth customs audits during which customs officers will inspect each step of the audit trail disrupting day-to-day business operation. Errors uncovered during these audits will yield heavy financial penalties and a customs debt. Ultimately, customs risk will impact on shareholders value. Customs and finance reporting should receive the same level of attention. However, if all companies check carefully their tax returns, only a few check their import or export declarations with the same scrutiny. Managing customs risk is often seen as a cost centre but it is also a source of competitive advantage. A sound customs management can reduce or remove customs duties, generate savings, and generally improve cash flow using the many customs procedures available to the compliant trader. Help is at hand, A Short Guide to Customs Risk will enable you to make informed decisions, and includes a foreword by the Head of the World Customs Organization: Kunio Mikuriya.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=9LHmulR-YJoC&dq=Customs&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Training guidelines for new staff in a community integrated living arrangement (Field experience paper)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Uq6TZLqiG-wC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Education and Peace","description":"The growing literature on Peace Education reflects a dynamic filed.

Peace Education includes cultivation of peacebuilding skills, e.g. dialogue, mediation, artistic endeavors. Peace educators, then teach the value of respect, understanding and nonviolence, present skills for analyzing international conflict, educate for alternative security systems and use a pedagogy that is democratic and particular. Thus, peace education as a practice and philosophy refers to matching complementary element between education and society, where the social purpose (i.e. why teach), educative process are conducive to fostering peace.

The federal government's efforts to pick and choose among the multitude of immigrants seeking to enter the United States began with the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. Conceived in ignorance and falsely presented to the public, it had undreamt of consequences, and this pattern has been rarely deviated from since. Immigration policy in Daniels' skilled hands shows Americans at their best and worst, from the nativist violence that forced Theodore Roosevelt's 1907 \\"gentlemen's agreement\\" with Japan to the generous refugee policies adopted after World War Two and throughout the Cold War. And in a conclusion drawn from today's headlines, Daniels makes clear how far ignorance, partisan politics, and unintended consequences have overtaken immigration policy during the current administration's War on Terror. Irreverent, deeply informed, and authoritative, Guarding the Golden Door presents an unforgettable interpretation of modern American history.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HBOS30NAKOQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The New White Nationalism in America: Its Challenge to Integration","description":"The author hopes to educate the public regarding white nationalists.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=HB1wyFPRGm4C&dq=The+New+White+Nationalism+in+America:+Its+Challenge+to+Integration&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Trice-Greatest Hermes; Studies in Hellenistic Theosophy and Gnosis","description":"Wij mensen kennen een diep verlangen om ons te verbinden en te verenigen. Waar komt die heimwee vandaan? En als die diepe wens gestild lijkt in een relatie, waarom volgen er dan zo vaak teleurstellingen? Met deze en andere vragen gaat Jacob Slavenburg op onderzoek uit. Zijn reis begint op het terrein van de uiterlijke geschiedenis, bij de tijdperken van de grote Moedergodin, en van het patriarchaat. Daarna onderzoekt hij de beweging achter de historische feiten. Was er werkelijk een splitsing in mannelijk en vrouwelijk en waar zou deze dan voor dienen? Via een omweg naar de hemel maken auteur en lezer kennis met het fenomeen tweelingzielen. Ten slotte, terug op aarde, valt ons de chemie op tussen het mannelijke en het vrouwelijke. Hier vinden we licht en duisternis, animus en anima, man en vrouw. Hier kunnen we ons van die schijnbare tegenstellingen bewust worden; hier vinden we antwoorden op onze vragen. Cultuurhistoricus drs. Jacob Slavenburg kreeg vooral bekendheid dankzij zijn uitgave van de spectaculaire Nag Hammadi-geschriften die in Egypte ontdekt werden.

When Otto Fenichel died, Anna Freud mourned the loss of 'his inexhaustible knowledge of psychoanalysis and his inimitable way of organizing and presenting his facts'. These qualities shine through The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis which has been a standard reference for generations of psychoanalysts. For this anniversary edition, Leo Rangell has written an introduction that sets Fenichel's work in context. He sees Fenichel as a worthy heir to Freud; both men influenced their followers by what Rangell calls 'the charisma of ideas'. In his epilogue, Rangell describes the fate of Fenichel's ideas and of this book as 'a barometer of the place of psychoanalysis ... within the external intellectual world and, even more significantly, of the trends and shifting winds of opinion within the psychoanalytic field itself'. He traces those trends through the turbulent controversies of the field, concluding that Fenichel's observations are as fresh and relevant today as they were fifty years ago.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=TippAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Introduction to Population Genetics Theory","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=MLETAQAAIAAJ&dq=Introduction+to+Population+Genetics+Theory&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Three Toots for Freddie","description":"Despite his size, Freddie the little freighter is finally successful in finding work.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=tBXyZwEACAAJ&dq=Three+Toots+for+Freddie&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Adventures of K'tonton: A little Jewish Tom Thumb","description":"The adventures of a thumb-sized boy born into a Jewish family.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=g2v-nQEACAAJ&dq=Adventures+of+K%27tonton:+A+little+Jewish+Tom+Thumb&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Southern Pacific, Vol. 1: Daylight, Train 98-99","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=v_NVAAAAMAAJ&dq=Southern+Pacific,+Vol.+1:+Daylight,+Train+98-99&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bearded Dragons (Reptile Basics)","description":"Describes the characteristics of bearded dragons, explains their care requirements, and lists special health concerns","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=1J4Od5JyJ04C&dq=Bearded+Dragons+(Reptile+Basics)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hunters of the Northern Ice","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=r9PkxwEACAAJ&dq=Hunters+of+the+Northern+Ice&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gravitation, Vol. 10","description":"Determined to become a rock star, Shuichi Shindou is discouraged by some harsh criticism he receives, and must find the strength to overcome his fears and keep trying.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=02I0MgEACAAJ&dq=Gravitation,+Vol.+10&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Simple soapmaking: Recipes & techniques for making beautiful handmade soaps","description":"Create Fabulous Modern Soaps The Truly Natural, Eco-Friendly Way With this new comprehensive guide, herbalist Jan Berry offers everything the modern-day enthusiast needs to make incredible botanical soaps.

Since its founding, different movements have been spawned and have interpreted Wesley's doctrine in their own way. The two volumes presented here represent the first installation of a three-part series that greatly expands upon Charles Jones's landmark 1974 work. This work focuses on the Wesleyan Holiness Movement, while the third and fourth volumes have the Keswick Movement and the Holiness Pentecostal Movement as their focal points. This series provides materials for study of doctrine, worship, institutional development and personalities, as well as antecedent and related movements. It will serve to illustrate the history both of the Holiness Movement and the rural-urban transition in which it developed. Theological reconsiderations, realignments, and changes, as well as the nearly exponential growth of the Movement since the book's publication, make these new publications almost absolutely necessary.

Anyone who has faced the challenges of limited living space will find inspiration in this survey of the latest trends in environmentally sensitive, small-scale residential designs. More than fifty residential spaces are profiled from woodsy houses and repurposed barns to cool apartments and urban lofts both inside and out. Most of the projects were designed by up-and-coming architects, and each design proves that small-scale efficiency as well as beautiful, thoughtful design can overcome the apparent constraints of a small setting. Environmental impact is a growing concern, so each project was chosen because of its ecological sensitivity. Each case history describes the challenges confronting the designer and the solutions. Creating color schemes to enhance the feeling of openness, taking advantage of high ceilings to make multiple levels, and using collapsible furniture and sliding doors to maximize space are some of the design solutions that can be applied in any situation. Filled with beautiful color photographs and helpful floorplans, this book is a remarkable showcase of how good design can transform any small space into a comfortable, modern and environmentally sensitive home.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=FQpwDwAAQBAJ&dq=Compact+Houses:+Architecture+for+the+Environment&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Terrible Truth About Investing: How to Be a Savvy Investor","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=H0MDywAACAAJ&dq=The+Terrible+Truth+About+Investing:+How+to+Be+a+Savvy+Investor&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Great Whitewater Fiasco","description":"Discusses the Whitewater affair, describes what has been learned by investigators, and suggests judicial reforms to dilute the influence of special interest groups on elections","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=b_eSpwAACAAJ&dq=The+Great+Whitewater+Fiasco&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The animals of Farmer Jones (A big golden book)","description":"It is suppertime on the farm.

Shaw s Cleopatra is a kittenish girl with a streak of cruelty, while his Caesar is a world-weary philosopher-soldier who is as much a stranger in Rome as in the barbaric court of Egypt. With wit, irony, and an undertone of melancholy, Caesar and Cleopatra satirizes Shakespeare s use of history and comments wryly on the politics of Shaw s own time. This is the definitive text prepared under the editorial supervision of Dan H. Laurence.

Toch moest ze het doen. Ze deed er tien jaar over om de moed daarvoor te vinden. De indrukwekkende geschiedenis van hoe het kleine meisje Salom  geofferd werd in Auschwitz. William Styrons Sophies keuze weerklinkt in Salom . De werkelijkheid kan nog aangrijpender zijn dan fictie. Toen Colombe Schneck in verwachting was van haar eerste kind suggereerde haar moeder achteloos de naam Salom . \`Naar mijn nichtje. Waarom ook niet, dacht Schneck. Pas later, nadat haar moeder was overleden, realiseerde ze zich dat ze de geschiedenis van haar familie zou moeten uitzoeken om te weten naar wie ze haar dochter had vernoemd. Salom  is het aangrijpende verslag van haar zoektocht. Tijdens haar reizen naar Amerika, Isra?l en Litouwen en de gesprekken met de vrouwen uit haar familie vallen de puzzelstukjes in elkaar. Ze ontdekt het onvoorstelbare offer waar haar familie altijd over heeft gezwegen. Op 26 oktober 1943 werden 2800 mensen verzameld voor selectie op een plein in het getto van Kaunas: fitte mensen gingen naar werkkampen, de anderen naar vernietigingskampen. Toen Schnecks overgrootmoeder aan de beurt was voor de keuring, wist ze dat zij het niet zou overleven. Ze wist ook dat de nazis moeders met kleine kinderen direct naar de gaskamers stuurden. Als haar dochter Macha bij haar kleindochter Salom  zou blijven, zouden ze alle drie omkomen. De oude vrouw pakte de hand van de kleine Salom  en bezegelde hiermee hun lot. Samen stierven ze in Auschwitz. Macha overleefde het werkkamp, hertrouwde en kreeg twee kinderen en zes kleinkinderen. Het is niet verwonderlijk dat haar familie nooit eerder sprak over Salom . Het offeren van het kleine meisje kwam voort uit een afgrijselijk wrede situatie. Het is de vraag of wij zelf de moed zouden hebben om een leven op te geven om een ander te redden.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=IyIhAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Creation in the Old Testament (Issues in Religion and Theology)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=gbvYAAAAMAAJ&dq=Creation+in+the+Old+Testament+(Issues+in+Religion+and+Theology)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Business Of Love (Arabesque)","description":"The heir to a Washington, D.C., hotel chain, Maya Woodson finds her plans for a successful public offering undermined by her feelings for Trajan Matthews, the handsome investor relations expert hired to run the stock offering.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=LSXFAFjZzTMC&dq=The+Business+Of+Love+(Arabesque)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"POSSESSED BY THE PAST: The Heritage Crusade and the Spoils of History","description":"A paperback edition of a critically-acclaimed 1998 study of the meaning and effects of 'Heritage'.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=qbDb7UbYFh8C&dq=POSSESSED+BY+THE+PAST:+The+Heritage+Crusade+and+the+Spoils+of+History&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Red River Requiem","description":"A murderous chess match set in the northwest Louisiana city of Shreveport between Bill Greyson and Detective Sgt.

Aubrey Malone has gone back to the start of the Oscar ceremonies and discovered that mistakes have been made every year in the choice of what has been deemed  best  in the categories of acting, directing, producing and the subsidiary awards. He has identified all the great stars (Garbo, Montgomery Clift, Peter O Toole, Barbara Stanwyck, etc.) who never held Oscars in their hands, and also iconic directors like Stanley Kubrick who were never thus honored. Why were some people over-rewarded by the Academy and why did others fall below the radar? The author outlines all of the extraneous factors leading to voting choices, and how Oscar pariahs have often been subsequently (or even posthumously) awarded for the wrong films to make up for omissions in a given year. With both wit and wisdom he has written an  alternative  history of the Oscars that will be required reading for both academics and film buffs alike. It tells the story behind the story.  If there were Oscars for research, Aubrey Malone would be right up there with the best of them.

As it says in the Bible, when she didn't know what to say, the Lord put words in her mouth, and she was amazed! Thus began a wondrous journey in faith. She found a job as the sole clerk in a small needlework shop. Surrounded by fabrics and threads plus daily contacts with enthusiastic customers, she was drawn into doing fine embroidery herself for the first time in her life. Encouraged by the success of her first piece, she began to plan a way to express with needle and thread her thoughts about God and marriage, and the wedding garments were conceived. An angel appeared to the woman to reveal God's purpose for these garments, which purpose reaches far beyond anything she had in mind. These garments have a role to play in God's plan for the health, success, and happiness of marriages in the future. They represent something new and something old-a new fashion for wedding attire in which both bride and groom wear complementary garments and an old tradition that both bride and groom wear their wedding garments twice, on the wedding day and also on the day of burial. Their message spans centuries and continents. \\"I loved the allegorical format of Mary's latest book, Behold! It shares the biblical truths of the marriage covenant in a way that is easy to understand. Behold! will make a perfect gift for a newly engaged couple as well as an anniversary gift for those in long-standing marriages.\\"-Eva \\"This book opened my heart to God's heart and His original plan for His creation to understand the covenant of marriage-both of a man and woman and also of the covenant marriage of Christ to His Bride.

It is, without doubt, an issue that has already influenced many international events. Richard Ben Cramer, who has won a Pulitzer Prize for his coverage of the Middle East, now presents readers with HOW ISRAEL LOST, a brilliant polemic looking at four key questions that define this conflict and explaining how the policies of Ariel Sharon have ostracised his country in the eyes of the world. Since Israel was founded, the West has seen it as a beacon of hope and democracy amid hostile neighbours. Cramer describes how in the past ten years Israelis seem to have squandered that respect and good will, focusing on the key players and crucial events that have turned the tide against Israel in the eyes of the international community. With the same meticulous research and intelligence that has made Richard Ben Cramer one of America's most highly regarded journalists, HOW ISRAEL LOST is a timely, powerful and important look at one of the most pivotal points of the world -- and in history.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=5-PUh5eGABAC&dq=How+Israel+Lost+:+The+Four+Questions&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"On the Edge (Silver Blades)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=3hHF2oiqmEoC&dq=On+the+Edge+(Silver+Blades)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Classic Reference Bible, Updated NASB","description":"Filled with the features that increase understanding with every use. - Complete text of the updated New American Standard Bible, today's most literal word-for-word translation. - Center-column references that unlock the depths of Scripture. - Maps and in-text charts for added insight while you read. - Introductions and outlines for every book of the Bible - Exclusive NASB Concordance for locating passages easily. - Easy-to-read typeface and verse-by-verse format with paragraph markers. - Presentation and Family Record pages for a lasting remembrance of significant events. - 8-page, full-color map section that accurately locates hundreds of important places in the Bible. - Red Letter text indicating the words of Christ. - Promises and Perspectives From the Bible.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=D3euGwAACAAJ&dq=Classic+Reference+Bible,+Updated+NASB&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Arrowsmith","description":"The Pulitzer Prize-winning novel recounts the story of a Midwestern physician who is forced to give up his profession due to the ignorance, corruption, and greed of society.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=-dWhngEACAAJ&dq=Arrowsmith&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"One Plus One Equals Nineteen: Married: The Second Time Around","description":"A fun loving family story with nuggets of wisdom and practical problem solving techniques.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=x5Ovkir_OsEC&dq=One+Plus+One+Equals+Nineteen:+Married:+The+Second+Time+Around&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Deux mondes: A Communicative Approach (Student Edition) + Listening Comprehension Audio CD","description":"Your students are changing.

Deux mondes, 7th edition, continues to offer a truly communicative approach that supports functional proficiency while responding to these changing needs in new and exciting ways.

The daughter of parents condemned as 'counter-revolutionaries' and enemies of the Communist state during the Anti-Rightist Campaign, she was conceived in a labour camp near Beijing. Fearing she would die in the camp as her sister had, her father had to send her away when she was only a week old. In Shanghai, she grew up with politically out-of-favour grandparents and miraculously survived the government's policy of starving its opponents. Under the hostile stare of Communist leaders, Lei endured the harassment of officials, teachers and Red Guards and the verbal and physical abuse of her peers, who labelled her a 'dog's daughter' -- the lowest of the wretched. She was made to watch her relatives tortured and friends and family turn against one another, as everyone rushed to toe the line of political correctness under Mao Zedong's extreme leftist, egalitarian regime. Then, in 1976, as if silent prayers were heard, Mao died. The political line changed and Lei was allowed to attend college. An outstanding academic and professional career followed, opening the doors to study in a foreign land that seemed to represent everything China was not -- the United States. But contrary to Lei's impressions, the university that she attended revealed itself to be a microcosm of Communist China, and the United States a more insidious land of persecution... Learn about one woman's tenacity in the face of starvation, rejection, and prejudice -- her journeys, sorrows and joys, as she travelled from East to West. Dog's Daughter reveals hard lessons in politics, human nature and life itself.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=mwDzAAAACAAJ&dq=Dog%27s+Daughter:+My+Life+in+Communist+China+and+Liberal+America&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Even the Stars Look Lonesome","description":"See the difference, read Maya Angelou in Large Print * About Large Print All Random House Large Print editions are published in a 16-point typeface This wise book is the wonderful continuation of the bestselling Wouldn't Take Nothing for My Journey Now.

During this period, the number of cities with gang problems increased from an estimated 286 jurisdictions with more than 2,000 gangs and nearly 100,000 gang members in 1980 (Miller, 1992) to about 4,800 jurisdictions with more than 31,000 gangs and approximately 846,000 gang members in 1996(Moore and Terrett, in press). An 11-city survey of eighth graders found that 9 percent were currently gang members, and 17 percent said they had belonged to a gang at some point in their lives (Esbensen and Osgood, 1997).Other studies reported comparable percentages and also showed that gang members were responsible for a large proportion of violent offenses. In the Rochester site of the OJJDP-funded Program of Research on the Causes and Correlates of Delinquency, gang members (30 percent of the sample) self-reported committing 68 percent of all violent offenses (Thornberry, 1998). In the Denver site, adolescent gang members (14 percent of the sample) self-reported committing 89 percent of all serious violent offenses (Huizinga, 1997). In another study, supported by OJJDP and several other agenciesand organizations, adolescent gang members in Seattle (15 percent of the sample) self-reported involvement in 85 percent of robberies committed by the entire sample (Battin et al., 1998).This Bulletin reviews data and research to consolidate available knowledge on youth gangs that are involved in criminal activity. Following a historical perspective, demographic information ispresented. The scope of the problem is assessed, including gang problems in juvenile detention and correctional facilities. Several issues are then addressed by reviewing gang studies to provide aclearer understanding of youth gang problems.An extensive list of references is provided for further review.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=x4HaAAAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"David Bowie: Out of the Cool","description":"Featuring photographs and interviews from Bowie's North American and European tours, this close-up profile discusses his concert, theatrical, film, and video careers, and analyzes recent changes in his music and life","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=6vUTAQAAIAAJ&dq=David+Bowie:+Out+of+the+Cool&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Web of Water: Life in Redwood Creek","description":"The flash of silver in green water; the deliberate \\"stitch-stitching\\" of a dragonfly laying eggs at the water's edge; the wonder of rocky, egg-filled nests releasing hundreds of coho salmon fry into a watery world of sun and shade; the rush and thrust of fresh water flowing into the salty Pacific -- this is part of life in Redwood Creek. For much of its length, the creek flows through Muir Woods National Monument, and the National Park Service monitors its health as one of the ways of understanding and protecting the environment.

So he took the name of his strip from the Latin phrase for \\"it does not follow\\" and created a comic that features no central character or theme, no setting or time frame, just a Twilight Zone of cartoon moments. Day after day, Non Sequitur hilariously jabs at the feats and foibles of life, skewering everyone from doctors to politicians. Wiley's irreverent, satirical wit, combined with his superbly crafted illustrations, confirms once and for all that the universe is one big joke at humanity's expense. In Wiley's world, no one is a better target than lawyers. That's why The Legal Lampoon, a collection of the cream of Non Sequitur's legal cartoon crop, will be one of the Wiley's most popular books. Consider the poor panhandler standing next to a signboard that reads, \\"Stood on principle. Won my lawsuit. Went bankrupt.\\" Or the Master of Spin, responding to his client's lost appeal to the parole board: \\"Congratulations! You've been held over by popular demand . . .\\" Or a fund-raiser who can't get any donations until she edits her sign to read: \\"Donations to spay and neuter stray pets and lawyers.\\" Throughout the pages of The Legal Lampoon, lawyers get a royal roasting. It's a hilarious collection that will appeal to everyone who both reviles and respects lawyers. Yes, it's true: Many lawyers let Wiley know how much they appreciate his attorney humor. It's a book made in legal heaven.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9TmsarPgQdEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"WILD ORCHARD A Novel of Down Under","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=1XksywEACAAJ&dq=WILD+ORCHARD+A+Novel+of+Down+Under&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Confessions of a Taoist on Wall Street","description":"Sun I, the illegitimate son of an American aviator and a Chinese beauty, leaves his remote Taoist monastery to find his father on Wall Street and is caught up in the way to wealth and power of \\"the other Tao\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=RLq-el2WujgC&dq=Confessions+of+a+Taoist+on+Wall+Street&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How to Photograph Your Life: Capturing Everyday Moments with Your Camera and Your Heart","description":"Full-color photographs highlight an authoritative guide to using one's camera to create great photographs, exploring more than forty picture-taking scenarious--from weddings and portraits to landscape and family--along with essential photographic techniques, tips, and tricks and special sections on travel photography and using a digital camera. 20,000 first printing.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=cr1BNwAACAAJ&dq=How+to+Photograph+Your+Life:+Capturing+Everyday+Moments+with+Your+Camera+and+Your+Heart&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Fighting Agents","description":"The Philippines, 1943: As the ragged remnants of the American forces stand against the might of the Imperial Japanese Army, a determined cadre of OSS agents becomes their only contact with the outside world-and their only hope for survival.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=RJpf9b1ogTwC&dq=The+Fighting+Agents&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"ExamKrackers: Complete MCAT Study Package (5 vol. set)","description":"Examkrackers manuals: * Emphasize a deep understanding of material so that you spend less time memorizing, making you faster and more confident on test day * Organize content conceptually increasing your studying efficiency so you retain more information on test day * Provide practice materials in the exact format of the MCATr so you are comfortable and confident on test day * Offer engaging visuals making your study more interesting and more memorable * Indicate which topics are more often tested by the MCATr and which topics require less attention so you can more effectively apportion your valuable study time","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Vkm6oAEACAAJ&dq=ExamKrackers:+Complete+MCAT+Study+Package+(5+vol.+set)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Reasoned Faith: Essays in Philosophical Theology in Honor of Norman Kretzmann","description":"With many Westerners questioning the merits of a secular society, a revival in the philosophy of religion has emerged.

Based on this original concept of the triadic, bidirectional and evolving mind, Belfiore has developed a coherent philosophical system, through which he offers fresh solutions in the fields of ontology, knowledge, language, aesthetics, ethics, politics, and law. The present third edition, like the previous one, includes an extensive treatment of the topics addressed as well as the quotation of the views of the major thinkers, whose thought has been discussed and reinterpreted. In addition, new concepts have been introduced, some passages have been clarified, and the style has been improved in several points. The result is an original and exhaustive book, which will be of interest to all philosophy scholars.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=IQp5DQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Classics of Country Blues Guitar: by Rory Block LEVEL 4 * INCLUDES TAB","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Ocean World of Jacques Cousteau - Volume 2 - the Act of Life","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=OmwbAQAAMAAJ&dq=The+Ocean+World+of+Jacques+Cousteau+-+Volume+2+-+the+Act+of+Life&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"98 Degrees","description":"Drew, Jeff, Nick and Justin.

Israeli scholar Daniel Dor measures the breach between Israel's collective consciousness and international public opinion, and concludes that Israeli society has dangerously withdrawn into a sense of isolation and victimization -- in very large part because of the role played by the Israeli media during the reoccupation. Dor examines the ways in which the major Israeli media not only reported on events (or failed to do so) but played a key part in shaping opinion, setting the agenda and waging the propaganda war that accompanied the military offensives on the ground. Originally published in Hebrew, this English-language version is revised, updated and recontextualised for non-Hebrew readers who might be less familiar with the minutiae of the Israeli media. Dor's study offers a damning indictment of the varied ways in which journalists and broadcasters abandoned any attempt at impartiality or so-called objectivity in their reportage, preferring instead to comply with an ideological imperative which in effect rules out any prospect of peace, justice or mutual understanding.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=qoFtAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Suppression+of+Guilt:+The+Israeli+Media+and+the+Reoccupation+of+the+West&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Silent Spring","description":"Rachel Carson's Silent Spring alerted a large audience to the environmental and human dangers of indiscriminate use of pesticides, spurring revolutionary changes in the laws affecting our air, land, and water. This Penguin Modern Classics edition includes an introduction by Lord Shackleton, a preface by World Wildlife Fund founder Julian Huxley, and an afterword by Carson's biographer Linda Lear. Now recognized as one of the most influential books of the twentieth century, Silent Spring exposed the destruction of wildlife through the widespread use of pesticides. Despite condemnation in the press and heavy-handed attempts by the chemical industry to ban the book, Rachel Carson succeeded in creating a new public awareness of the environment which led to changes in government and inspired the ecological movement. It is thanks to this book, and the help of many environmentalists, that harmful pesticides such as DDT were banned from use in the US and countries around the world. Rachel Carson (1907-64) wanted to be a writer for as long as she could remember. Her first book, Under the Sea Wind, appeared in 1941. Silent Spring, which alerted the world to the dangers of the misuse of pesticides, was published in 1962. Carson's articles on natural history appeared in the Atlantic Monthly, the New Yorker, Reader's Digest and Holiday. An ardent ecologist and preservationist, Carson warned against the dumping of atomic waste at sea and predicted global warming. If you enjoyed Silent Spring, you might like John Christopher's The Death of Grass, also available in Penguin Modern Classics.

In addition to defining the prob lems, and presenting the solutions, the software programmer is con fronted with the challenge of having to predict what combination of ideas and technologies will move the industry forward in the most compelling way. Even though we've seen the development of tremendous applications in a surprisingly short period of time, the most difficult problems often surface when we try to elevate a suc cessful local idea to the international arena. In the case of Apple Computer, these challenges become especially profound when you consider that Apple sells Macintosh not just in the United States, but in Japan, China, the Middle East, Africa, East ern Europe, and even to the United Nations itself. Of course, this means that the personal computer must work everywhere around the world. But more significantly, it also means that the software must reflect the uniqueness of a given culture, its language, morals, and even its sense of humor. To step away from a narrowly-defined, nationally-based paradigm for software development, programmers, management, and entire corporations must learn to recognize what elements of an interface, problem solving technique, documentation illustration, package de sign, and advertisement are local, and which elements are appro priate for global markets.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_ZXwBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"America's Caesar","description":"This is Volume 1 of a two volume set. Please order both volumes for a complete set. America is no longer the land of the free. In Senate Report 93-549, the United States Congress made the astonishing admission that, since at least 9 March 1933, the American people have lived under a state of national emergency. Instead of a federal Government of delegated and limited powers, what now operates from Washington, D.C. is a centralized military despotism which claims ultimate sovereignty over its citizens and rules them by statute in all cases whatsoever. Beginning with the usurpations of Abraham Lincoln, this book explains how the so-called emergency powers of the President of the United States developed over a period of seven decades and finally culminated in the virtual supplanting of the Constitution by Franklin Delano Roosevelt's New Deal democracy. The author draws heavily from a wealth of rare political literature from the past two centuries, as well as long-forgotten Government documents to paint an unsettling picture of American history and to show why nothing ever seems to change in Washington, no matter which political party is currently in power.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=UJO0oAEACAAJ&dq=America%27s+Caesar&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Carlyles at Home","description":"The Carlyles at Home and Abroad explores the extensive influence of Thomas Carlyle and Jane Welsh Carlyle in England and Scotland, Europe, and the United States.

In an age when teams have become critical to successful problem solving, Adaption-Innovation (A-I) theory is a model in this field, which aims to increase collaboration and reduce conflict within groups. A-I Theory and associated inventory (KAI) have been extensively researched and are increasingly used to assist teambuilding and personnel management. In the context of the management of diversity and change, Dr Kirton outlines the central concepts of the theory, including the processes of problem solving, decision making and creativity as well as explanatory concepts such as the paradox of structure; coping behaviour; the distinction between how teams collaborate on the common task and how teams manage their own diversity. In addition, Dr Kirton focuses on the positive side of managing a wide diversity within teams that has the potential to lead to the highest levels of problem solving, creativity and effective management of change. The book offers practical information for those helping diverse teams succeed in today's demanding climate. In this fresh context, leadership theory is explored, suggesting a new and interesting approach in use of different styles. For those working with diverse, problem solving teams managing complex change, this is a must have book. It will appeal to a broad range of people, from practitioners such as human resource managers, psychologists, business consultants, and group trainers, to academics studying and doing research in disciplines such as psychology, business, management, sociology, education and politics and the practical use of the hard sciences. *This reprint contains some new insights by Dr. Kirton into the theory. A small number of critical key changes have been made: a new diagram showing the difference between decision making and problem solving; some tightening of some sentences to show that leadership style should be treated as roles; the addition of the Glossary of Terms.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QrKAAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Step One: Play Guitar","description":"\\"Learn to play blues, rock, and country styles.

Psychologist Michael D. Yapko explains that in order to find relief, more than the current episode of depression must be examined. In Breaking the Patterns of Depression, he presents skills that enable readers to understand and ultimately avert depression's recurring cycles. Focusing on future prevention as well as initial treatment, the book includes over one hundred structured activities to help sufferers learn the skills necessary to become and remain depression-free. Breaking the Patterns of Depression begins by translating the clinical literature on psychotherapy and antidepressant medication into language that can be used to enhance an understanding of depression, and to personalize individual cures. Yapko uses a conversational, anecdotal tone that encourages readers to take an active approach to helping themselves. Special sections entitled \\"Learn by Doing\\" and \\"Shifting Perspectives\\" help develop the skills necessary to manage difficult experiences. Readers learn how to solve problems effectively, anticipate the likely consequences of their actions, think and act in a direct, goal-oriented fashion, balance different areas of their lives, and use self-knowledge to stay out of harmful situations. More realistic and helpful than other depression-management books on the market, Breaking the Patterns of Depression defines what causes depression and, best of all, clarifies what can be done about it. With this knowledge in hand, readers can control their depression, rather than having depression control them.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4NRiSTjpfpYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Richard Scarry's Little Counting Book (Jellybean Books(R))","description":"Presents the numbers from one to ten, and the beginnings of addition, as Willy Bunny counts what he sees, starting with one bunny.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Dt2B6bU7sXMC&dq=Richard+Scarry%27s+Little+Counting+Book+(Jellybean+Books(R))&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"My Autobiography","description":"Raw, funny and down-to-earth, this book takes you behind the scenes of Liverpool and England s greatest triumphs and disasters in the company of an intelligent and controversial player.

Former sexual outlaws have challenged their exclusion and are being incorporated into citizenship. But as citizenship becomes more sexed, it also becomes privatized and self-disciplined. The author explores these contesting representations of sex and belonging in films, television, and legal decisions. She examines a broad range of subjects, from gay men and lesbians, pornographers and hip hop artists, to women selling vibrators, adulterers, and single mothers on welfare. She observes cultural representations ranging from Queer Eye for the Straight Guy to Dr. Phil, Sex in the City to Desperate Housewives. She reviews appellate court cases on sodomy and same-sex marriage, national welfare reform, and obscenity regulation. Finally, the author argues that these representations shape the terms of belonging and governance, producing good (and bad) sexual citizens, based on the degree to which they abide by the codes of privatized and self-disciplined sex.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=d-5F0GTLJPQC&dq=SEXUAL+CITIZEN&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jack Kirby's Fourth World: Featuring: Mister Miracle","description":"'Jack Kirby's fourth world' focuses on two of the most intriguing New Gods, Mister Miracle and Big Barda, and their extraordinary clashes with an outrageous assortment of villains.

It is vital for church leaders to grapple seriously with this question, for pat answers no longer suffice. Lives well-lived, not just words eloquently spoken, must become our response. The quality of our relationship with God is what will influence the health, potency, and witness of the church in an increasingly complex and hostile world. Designed for use as a college or seminary course, Conformed to His Image helps us build our lives on a fully biblical perspective. Exploring twelve approaches to Christian spirituality in depth, Dr. Kenneth Boa corrects our tendency to pick and compartmentalize. Pointing the way instead to an integrative, whole-life approach, Dr. Boa shows how each spiritual paradigm discussed is just one important facet in the gem of authentic and powerful New Testament living. With chapter overviews and objectives, questions for personal application, a glossary, and a list of key terms, Conformed to His Image will prove a defining text for the student, pastor, and church leader of today . . . and tomorrow. 12 Facets of the Complete Christian Life Relational Spirituality: Loving God Completely, Ourselves Correctly, and Others Compassionately Paradigm Spirituality: Cultivating an Eternal versus a Temporal Perspective Disciplined Spirituality: Engaging in the Historical Differences Exchanged Life Spirituality: Grasping Our True Identity in Christ Motivated Spirituality: A Set of Biblical Incentives Devotional Spirituality: Falling in Love with God Holistic Spirituality: Every Component of Life under the Lordship of Christ Process Spirituality: Being versus Doing, Process versus Product Spirit-Filled Spirituality: Walking in the Power of the Spirit Warfare Spirituality: The World, the Flesh, and the Devil Nurturing Spirituality: A Lifestyle of Discipleship and Evangelism Corporate Spirituality: Encouragement, Accountability, and Worship","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=zQoFsNMsPtcC&dq=Conformed+to+His+image&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Treasury of American Short Stories","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Z9J8mDZjPoEC&dq=The+Treasury+of+American+Short+Stories&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"O'Shaughnessy's cafe","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=I21BAAAAIAAJ&dq=O%27Shaughnessy%27s+cafe&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A time to love ... a time to die","description":"From the quintessential author of wartime Germany, A Time to Love and a Time to Die echoes the harrowing insights of his masterpiece All Quiet on the Western Front. After two years at the Russian front, Ernst Graeber finally receives three weeks  leave. But since leaves have been canceled before, he decides not to write his parents, fearing he would just raise their hopes. Then, when Graeber arrives home, he finds his house bombed to ruin and his parents nowhere in sight. Nobody knows if they are dead or alive. As his leave draws to a close, Graeber reaches out to Elisabeth, a childhood friend. Like him, she is imprisoned in a world she did not create. But in a time of war, love seems a world away. And sometimes, temporary comfort can lead to something unexpected and redeeming.  The world has a great writer in Erich Maria Remarque. He is a craftsman of unquestionably first rank, a man who can bend language to his will. Whether he writes of men or of inanimate nature, his touch is sensitive, firm, and sure.

Kate Quinn, New York Times Bestselling Author of The Alice Network Beatriz Williams, the New York Times bestselling author of The Summer Wives, is back with another hot summer read; a dazzling epic of World War II in which a beautiful young  society reporter  is sent to the Bahamas, a haven of spies, traitors, and the infamous Duke and Duchess of Windsor. The Bahamas, 1941. Newly-widowed Leonora  Lulu  Randolph arrives in the Bahamas to investigate the Governor and his wife for a New York society magazine. After all, American readers have an insatiable appetite for news of the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, that glamorous couple whose love affair nearly brought the British monarchy to its knees five years earlier. What more intriguing backdrop for their romance than a wartime Caribbean paradise, a colonial playground for kingpins of ill-gotten empires? Or so Lulu imagines. But as she infiltrates the Duke and Duchess s social circle, and the powerful cabal that controls the islands  political and financial affairs, she uncovers evidence that beneath the glister of Wallis and Edward s marriage lies an ugly and even treasonous reality. In fact, Windsor-era Nassau seethes with spies, financial swindles, and racial tension, and in the middle of it all stands Benedict Thorpe: a scientist of tremendous charm and murky national loyalties. Inevitably, the willful and wounded Lulu falls in love. Then Nassau s wealthiest man is murdered in one of the most notorious cases of the century, and the resulting coverup reeks of royal privilege. Benedict Thorpe disappears without a trace, and Lulu embarks on a journey to London and beyond to unpick Thorpe s complicated family history: a fateful love affair, a wartime tragedy, and a mother from whom all joy is stolen. The stories of two unforgettable women thread together in this extraordinary epic of espionage, sacrifice, human love, and human courage, set against a shocking true crime . . . and the rise and fall of a legendary royal couple.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=w2dzDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Arrow of Gold","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ZHq4wAEACAAJ&dq=Arrow+of+Gold&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Deuce","description":"72 spectacular and entertaining tricks: card locations, coincidence tricks, mental magic with cards, tricks with double endings, tricks with two decks, predictions, tricks with borrowed decks, trick poker deals.

After England's Glorious Revolution, says Thomas Kidd, New Englanders abandoned their previous hostility toward Britain, viewing it as the chosen leader in the Protestant fight against world Catholicism. They also imagined themselves part of an international Protestant community and replaced their Puritan beliefs with a revival-centered pan-Protestantism. Kidd discusses the rise of the Protestant interest and provides a compelling argument about the origins of both eighteenth-century revivalism and the global evangelical movement.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=-IqHF6W6TOkC&dq=First+in+Line:+Tracing+Our+Ape+Ancestry&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Godseed","description":"\\"This Word-Artist will lull you into a sparkling sense of Grace with her exquisite clarity of the certainty of God in All.

The Bounds of Sense is one of the most influential books ever written about Kant s philosophy, and is one of the key philosophical works of the late twentieth century. Whilst probably best known for its criticism of Kant s transcendental idealism, it is also famous for the highly original manner in which Strawson defended and developed some of Kant s fundamental insights into the nature of subjectivity, experience and knowledge  at a time when few philosphers were engaging with Kant s ideas. The book had a profound effect on the interpretation of Kant s philosophy when it was first published in 1966 and continues to influence discussion of Kant, the soundness of transcendental arguments, and debates in epistemology and metaphysics generally.

Have you ever wondered how life began on earth? Have you ever heard others discuss origins but felt unable to contribute to the conversation? Would you like to defend your views but feel unequipped or inadequate to do so? Are you unsure about what to believe? Would you like to learn more about the subject of origins? If so, this book will be a help to you. The subject of evolution and creation often causes much contention and controversy. The question that may be asked is, Why is there so much tension and animosity between those who hold to opposing views regarding the subject of origins? Others may ask, What do those of opposing views base their beliefs upon? Is there any reconciling of the different views? The differences, I believe, in part are due to ones perceptions regarding science and theology. This book is not about Christians versus atheists. This book is more about creation versus evolution than about Creationism versus Evolutionism. This book is about comparing various views, opinions and evidence related to evolution and creation. Some of the information being presented may be new to you and may take some time to digest. Evolutionists generally view creation in the same way that creationists generally view evolution. Opposing views are rarely taken seriously, as they are a contradiction to ones own bias. Whatever your current views are regarding the origins of the universe and life or level of knowledge of origins, this book is about considering various sides of the issue of evolution. In this book we will be comparing the evidence and arguments and then weighing the pros and cons in an attempt to determine the validity of each view. You will, however, be left to make your own decisions about each subject that is presented. This book may either strengthen your current views of origins or may cause you to re-think what you currently believe about origins. Whatever your views are regarding the origins of the universe and life, this book is about considering various sides of the issue of evolution. In this book the evidence and arguments will be presented for the reader to determine the validity of each view. Subjects such as: the origin of the universe, the age of the universe, the fossil evidence, the possibilities of a global flood, the origins of life, Stanley Millers Experiment of 1953, the fossils in the strata of the earth, the components of evolution (Natural Selection, Adaptation, Mutations, Speciation, and Genetic Drift), Punctuated Equilibrium, Haeckels Embryos and Recapitulation, Vestiges, Pseudogenes, Biological Complexity and Intelligent Design, Comparing biological similarities and differences between Chimpanzee and human genome, Comparing the Human and Ape Fossil Evidence, will be examined. Multiple top resources of various professions have been included in this book to provide information on the many different subjects discussed. Although this book is an in-depth study of evolution, it was written on the level so that the average teenager or adult will be able to understand what is being presented. Difficult words and terms are explained so that you will not need to consult a dictionary every time an unknown word or term appears. I attempted to present the subject matter on a level that most people will be able to easily understand. The various views and arguments are presented in a manner similar to having a debate. The aim of this book is to help either strengthen your current views of origins or cause you to re-think what you currently believe. It is hoped that at least you will develop a better appreciation for the opposing views and will better understand why those who believe in the opposing views believe as they do.

The purpose of the book is to provide a resource for women who desire to minister to others. It is designed to encourage and equip women to speak truth to those who are younger; breaking through barriers in order to deal with difficult questions women face in the 21st century. Rather than offering another set of answers from one woman's perspective, this study takes each woman to passages of Scripture, helping her discover what God is saying to her personally, without skirting the deeper issues. Although the study is ideal for group discussions, it can easily be adapted to individual study use or one-on-one mentoring. The first four chapters look at the four qualifications for women in ministry: a priestly lifestyle, a commitment to confidentiality, freedom from addictions and an appreciation for beauty and the ability to teach it. Younger women may take this study to learn what they are to seek in an older woman mentor and be better prepared to minister to others. Each of the remaining chapters takes one of the topics Paul identifies as important for women and seeks to develop a biblical foundation for understanding and training.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=O2rWOAAACAAJ&dq=Woman+to+Woman:+Life+Principles+from+Titus+2+(Following+God+Discipleship+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Panorama of the Old Testament: A survey of Old Testament history and literature","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=yyZUswEACAAJ&dq=Panorama+of+the+Old+Testament:+A+survey+of+Old+Testament+history+and+literature&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lumenagerie","description":"The Lumenagerie is the House of the Creatures of Light and their Mistresses and Masters.

Ruby quickly winds her way into the ripe center of the city the darkened piano bars and hidden alleyways of the Village all the while hoping for a glimpse of the red hair and green eyes of her mother. When a telegram from her cousin forces her to return home, thirty-year-old Ruby finds herself reliving the devastating violence of her girlhood. With the terrifying realization that she might not be strong enough to fight her way back out again, Ruby struggles to survive her memories of the town s dark past.

Figures like Joss Whedon are both one of  us  and one of  them.  This is a strategy of marketing and branding it is a claim from the auteur himself or industry PR machines that the presence of an auteur who is also a fan means the product is worth consuming. Such claims that fan credentials guarantee quality are often contested, with fans and critics alike rejecting various auteur figures as the true leader of their respective franchises. That split, between assertions of fan and auteur status and acceptance (or not) of that status, is key to unravelling the fan auteur. In A Portrait of the Auteur as Fanboy: The Construction of Authorship in Transmedia Franchises, authors Anastasia Salter and Mel Stanfill examine this phenomenon through a series of case studies featuring fanboys. The volume discusses both popular fanboys, such as J. J. Abrams, Kevin Smith, and Joss Whedon, as well as fangirls like J. K. Rowling, E L James, and Patty Jenkins, and dissects how the fanboy-fangirl auteur dichotomy is constructed and defended by popular media and fans in online spaces, and how this discourse has played in maintaining the exclusionary status quo of geek culture. This book is particularly timely given current discourse, including such incidents as the controversy surrounding Joss Whedon s so-called feminism, the publication of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, and contestation over authorial voices in the DC cinematic universe, as well as broader conversations about toxic masculinity and sexual harassment in Hollywood.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=uTX7DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"You Can't Say That to Me: Stopping the Pain of Verbal Abuse--An 8- Step Program","description":"Verbal abuse comes in many devastating forms--but no matter how or when it occurs, abuse language can have grave long-term consequences for the victim's physical and psychological health and well-being.

A few years ago, customs officers at the border were meticulously checking goods and documents before releasing a shipment to the trader. A business could be confident that a shipment that had cleared customs complied with all applicable regulations. Today, to reduce congestion and give the trade quick access to their goods, customs have introduced risk management principles and a large number of shipments clear customs automatically. Controls have moved from the border to the trader s premises and it is during site visits that customs officers check the business compliance records. Moving from frontier checks to audit based controls has transferred a high level of responsibility and risk to the trader. It is now the duty of the trader to identify and report any error or irregularity and to keep an impeccable audit trail from initial quotation to receipt of payment. For the business, failing to provide satisfactory compliance records will result in delayed shipments and serious disruption in the supply chain. This will in turn impact on financial performance indicators such as Days in Inventory, Days Sales Outstanding and of course Cash Flow. The business will also have to endure in depth customs audits during which customs officers will inspect each step of the audit trail disrupting day-to-day business operation. Errors uncovered during these audits will yield heavy financial penalties and a customs debt. Ultimately, customs risk will impact on shareholders value. Customs and finance reporting should receive the same level of attention. However, if all companies check carefully their tax returns, only a few check their import or export declarations with the same scrutiny. Managing customs risk is often seen as a cost centre but it is also a source of competitive advantage. A sound customs management can reduce or remove customs duties, generate savings, and generally improve cash flow using the many customs procedures available to the compliant trader. Help is at hand, A Short Guide to Customs Risk will enable you to make informed decisions, and includes a foreword by the Head of the World Customs Organization: Kunio Mikuriya.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=9LHmulR-YJoC&dq=Customs&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Le Trone de Fer T2 - Le Donjon Rouge (Science Fiction) (French Edition)","description":"Includes, 1982-1995: Les Livres du mois, also published separately.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=W9tBAQAAIAAJ&dq=Le+Trone+de+Fer+T2+-+Le+Donjon+Rouge+(Science+Fiction)+(French+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Promise Bible God's Words in Your Words (Comtemporary English Version)","description":"This unique Bible highlights and explains over 200 of God's promises given to us in Scripture.

How do such books negotiate the tension between the desire to protect children, and the commitment to tell children the truth about the world? If Holocaust representations in children s books respect the narrative conventions of hope and happy endings, how do they differ, if at all, from popular representations intended for adult audiences? And where does innocence lie, if the children s fable of Roberto Benigni s Life is Beautiful is marketed for adults, and far more troubling survivor memoirs such as Anita Lobel s No Pretty Pictures: A Child of War are marketed for children? How should Holocaust Studies integrate discourse about children s literature into its discussions? In approaching these and other questions, Kertzer uses the lens of children s literature to problematize the ways in which various adult discourses represent the Holocaust, and continually challenges the conventional belief that children s literature is the place for easy answers and optimistic lessons.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=i0eWAgAAQBAJ&dq=My+Mother%27s+Voice:+Children,+Literature,+and+the+Holocaust&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Toyota Hilux/4 Runner Diesel 1979-1997 Auto Repair Manual-LN, Diesel Eng 2 & 4 Wheel Drive (Max Ellery's Vehicle Repair Manuals)","description":"Step by step instructions with plenty of photographs, plus detailed information on 4 cylinder L, 2L, 2L-T and 3L vehicles including turbo versions from 1979 to 1997, 2WD and 4WD.

Wanting the blessing of God, she seeks it in carnal ways. The Great Commission, however, commands Church leaders to teach their disciples \\"to observe all\\" that Jesus commanded. This book, therefore, has the underlying assumption that diminished faithfulness to commandments may stem from exegetical oversight. First, Christians may be overlooking the full meaning and significance of the Greek verb behind \\"observe.\\" A literature review revealed that the word implies four independent concepts, the primary one being observation; the others are guardianship, cognition, and obedience. Because of this etymological link with the sense of sight, and fully supported by scripture, this book proposes that disciplers must personify Jesus' commands so their students can observe them optically and behaviorally. The second exegetical oversight this book suggests is that Church leaders may be incorrectly identifying the Great Commission's core curriculum. A literature review discovered that there is no consensus surrounding the content of \\"all.\\" Many theologians simply assume everyone already knows what it means. Of those that directly address the issue, however, a multitude of views exist. Some scholars, nevertheless, do rally around Jesus' commands in Matthew as the content of \\"all\\"-but even these have a variety of interpretations. One major issue they disagree over is Jesus' support for commandments in the Old Testament. Based on a variety of factors, this book concludes that the in situ meaning of \\"to observe all\\" in Matthew 28.20 is that Jesus' disciples shall observe all the Jesus commanded in the Gospel of Matthew. Because of Matthew 5.17-48, this also includes observing everything commanded in the Old Testament as it is reinterpreted in the light of Christ.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=FMxsrgEACAAJ&dq=Teaching+them+to+observe,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Other Side of the River (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","description":"Jingqiu, an innocent young woman from a politically questionable family in the city, is selected as one of a small group of students to be sent to the countryside to work on a project that will further the Cultural Revolution.

Weber became one of the most respected directors of his generation, but Philip s talent went unnoticed until he found his calling making horror pictures, a genre in which his gruesome imagination could shine. But everything changes one morning when he calls his old friend Weber to say hello, then kills himself only an hour later. From Philip, Weber inherits a box of three videotapes. The first tape begins with Philip, warning Weber of challenges ahead, mysterious things he couldn t handle but believes that Weber can. Then Weber sees something unbelievable: a first-person view of his mother s last minutes alive before a plane crash took her life in 1960. Weber watches her settle into her airplane seat and read a newspaper, then hears the passengers scream as the jet falls from the sky. Before he died, Philip had unlocked a terrible secret.
