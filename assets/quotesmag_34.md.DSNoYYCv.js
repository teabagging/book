She is now old enough to point out the cats and mouse etc and the story is a darling one. We have bought this book many times for family and friends."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I have read this book to my baby nearly every night since she was born. I was using an old paperback copy I had, but my 7 month old wants to turn the pages herself. So glad it's available as a board book. It's a timeless classic and a favorite."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"A great beginning to my grandson's library. I bought this for his first birthday."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This is book is a good one to read at bed time, the feelings in book match with the mood the kid usually are at bed time. As we read it to kids, they come up with so many other things to say good night, its intersting to watch what they can come up with."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"My children loved this book. We read it to them for many years. Until they were able to read for themselves. It's very soothing. And because they were so familiar with it, they enjoyed it more."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This little hard cover book is great,and it travels well . It has been a long time favorite to read for neices and nephews. And now we are hoping it will be a favorite for our grandchild as well."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This was my favorite story book as a kid, and it still makes me smile. Highly reccomend it."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This item of psychedelic literature appears charming at first, with its depictions of traditional Anglo-American d&eacute;cor and its rhythmic treatment of a soothing bedtime ritual. But closer inspection reveals subtle dangers for the young mind. This is not just the story of a rabbit-child going to bed, saying goodnight to everything he sees. This is the story of a mind on edge, of the dissolution of temporal reality. What is there is not necessarily there, like the red balloon that disappears in the middle of the book, only to reappear at the end. Or the socks on the drying rack, inexplicably gone. Or the painting of the moon-jumping cow; sometimes we see a mailbox there, sometimes not. The number of books on the bookshelf changes, throwing the very notion of objective perception into chaos. If one cannot be sure of where one is or what is in front of him, how can he be sure that he is anywhere at all? \\"Cogito ergo sum\\" offers little comfort in a world where the self has no ground to stand on.But the ultimate threat to the unsteady mind is on the rabbit's nightstand, where a copy of Goodnight Moon rests ever so humbly. Imagine: a book within itself, within itself, within itself, to infinity. What tricks this could play on a young reader who, sitting in his room alone, mind dimmed with fatigue, only wanted to say goodnight to that lovely bowl of mush! Oh that tasty, tasty mush. Just like mom makes, with the raisins and the brown sugar. Or you always thought she made, but now you can't be sure.Highly recommended as a sink or swim test for curious young minds. Also consider Common Psychological Disorders in Young Children for parental reading."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I first read this book when my son was a year old. The simple words and colorful illustrations made it one of his favorite bedtime rituals. The book focuses on a little rabbit going to bed and saying \\"good night\\" to everything in his room as well as the moon outside. In addition to reading the book, I would ask my son to point to the things the rabbit was saying \\"Good Night\\" to. Especially finding the little mouse on every color page. (I believe he's on everyone). We used it like an identification game as well as a story. Simple words that rhyme like \\"Hush\\" and \\"Mush\\" are easy for little ones to learn and repeat.An interesting aspect of the illustrations is that the room is drawn darker as the book nears its end. The magic was still there the other night when I read it to my son who is now 3 and a half. Like other books by this author, there is an essentially childlike quality coupled with that \\"hard to pin down\\" quality of a classic."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This book is soft on the mind and soft on the feelings. I've read it to all 7 of my children and passed out copies to many friends. It does not stimulate or activate. It does not make noise. Rather it penetrates. It honors the things around us and some of the things that aren't quite things. It reminds us that we are part of something larger and that we can rest and sleep in peace."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This book is a miracle worker for the tired parent. I received the hardcover copy when my first child was born, and it was a fascination to him at bedtime (age 1 - 3) and his siblings for years and years.The children's favorite part of this book has always been the search for the teeny mouse, who is doing something on every page - sometimes he's hard to find, and although the search went on repeatedly, there was always a squeal of delight when he was found.This book is a common gift item - the board book for the child, especially - but a copy of the hardcover can become a family library gift. I only wish I could find mine - we went through 1 hardcover and 2 board books!This is one book where multiple copies are probably always going to be welcome.Consider adding a bookplate with the new child's name on it."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"There never has been, and never will be, a children's book quite as wonderful as GOODNIGHT MOON. My mom read this to me when I was little, and I've bought it for other young ones since then because it was my favorite as a child. The pictures and words alone are more soothing than a thousand nighttime rockings.This is an American classic, and it's not hard to see why. It's simple, it's lovely and it's downright perfect. Buy it for anyone expecting a child. They'll thank you for it."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Mr. Mitchell's remarks (below) strike me as intelligent and true, but something about this book resists analysis. He's absolutely right, though, to say that cadence is crucial. Like any good lullabye, it's the rhythm of the words, not the meaning of the words, that do the lulling.Some of my colleagues ridicule me for this, but I truly believe Goodnight Moon is a great poem. When my brother, Henry, suffered a stroke and needed to relearn how to speak, I brought this book into the hospital room and together we recited Brown's verse, over and over. I can say it now in my sleep, and I fear I sometimes do.After my brother passed away I read the book aloud at his funeral. &quot;Good night noises everywhere.&quot;I hope you're sleeping well, Henry."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Once again Margaret Wise Brown proves herself the mistress of the macabre in this daring tale of suspense. The riveting plot concerns a child-rabbit held hostage in a mysterious room by a seemingly benign yet omnipresent 'old lady'. Is she a threat or merely a representation of the authority figure we all resent yet are powerless to battle.? Perhaps, even, God?The victim is fighting to stay awake after, it is implied, being forcibly fed 'a bowl full of mush'. Vermin running rampant and nightmarish surreal paintings of wild animals add to the atmosphere of horrifying menace.Although less complex than her other subjects (stalking in 'Runaway Bunny' and homelessness in 'A Home For A Bunny'). Ms. Brown is obviously at her zenith with this page turner. You won't want to put it down...just keep the lights on!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"The pictures in this board book are cropped, which is just sad because the artwork is such an integral part of the story! In addition, it's very difficult to see the details such as the \\"young mouse\\" on each page.My mom has one of the original printings, so she's very cautious to read it to my little girl and then hide it away on a high shelf. My little girl now goes after the original book, and tries to climb the shelving, so I had to get her a new full-size hardcover edition. She reaches for this book every night before bed, leaves the antique edition alone, and ignores the board book."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"The pictures are cropped on each page which means you don't see the whole picture that you see in the non-board book version."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I love that this book is offered in a big book edition for kids. My son loves this book and when I found it in large print I knew we had to have it. He is three years old and has a brain tumor on his optic nerves which makes him somewhat visually impaired and the size of the book has helped him tremendously. Since getting this in the large print he now is able to identify the objects the story refers to, whereas he couldn't in the small print. We hope other books will be offered in this format also!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I gave this as a gift at a baby shower. The mother to be loved it."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I bought this book for my 2 year old daughter with fond memories from my childhood. She loves it, and wants to read the 'moon book' every night. She loves it so much she even 'takes care' of it, sleeping with it at night and gently turning the pages (all other paperback books have been ripped thus far). If you don't own this, you need to."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Great book with nicely laid out objects that kids can spot. I've almost memorized the whole book."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I bought this is a gift for a new mommy--My children LOVED this story and I can still hear it in my dreams!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"A classic book. Right size to slip into any baby gift basket. Should be sturdy enough for years of baby abuse."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Initially, I would have rated this book a one star but after reading reviews of others who had children before, I decided to give the book a chance. I learned that the repetition of this book is a teaching tool and realized that as I began to read the book to my infant a couple months ago. As time goes by, she is beginning to recognize the common objects in the pictures that she sees in our home. I love the way the room darkens as it is getting closer to bed time. The illustrations are beautiful and the other objects drawn in the \\"great green room\\" were carefully thought out by the illustrator. The simplicity of the home environment gives the reader a feeling of warmth and security. Yes, the simple words will eventually get boring to an adult, but to a baby/child with limited vocabulary, it is perfect."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I love reading this book to my daughter! It is definitely a must-own children's book."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This book is a childhood classic. Make sure you have one in your home! I don't go to a Baby Shower without one."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Review by Sherry North, Author, Because You Are My BabyGoodnight Moon is a classic with good reason. The poetic text has a gentle, soothing rhythm that truly can lull young kids to sleep. The artwork seems a bit dated though. Every other spread is in B&W;, and the color spreads have a very limited palette featuring a lot of orange and green. This simple art may appeal to very young children, even if moms find it lacking."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I was pleased with my purchase of this book - it was easy to find what I wanted - apply payment - and it arrived in a few days. It was a gift!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"very good illustrations.lots of details.my daughter soon started to give me the next word when I pause.she even found out the mouse ate the mush in the end.some times she reads it backwards to see the light turns on.book sturdy too."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This book was read to me when I was little. It's been packed away for years and has been brought out again to read to my daughter. She's 19m and already loves it. A classic and a favorite!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This was the first book I learned to read by myself! I bought it to give to our first grandbaby.. I hope she loves it as much as I did !!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"My daughter, who is 23 now, still talks about this book and when she was tiny I remember her asking me to read it every night for months on end. It had a mesmerizing effect on her and helped calm her down for sleep, which as I remember it myself, was always a scary part of the day - a time for darkness and separation. Hence, my fascination with the book. Too bad my parents didn't read this book to me when I was a child."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I bought Goodnight Moon for my 16 month old granddaughter for Christmas. She just loves this book and carries it around with her. She doesn't like to have books read to her before going to bed, but whenever anyone comes to her house she hands them her book. She knows what everything is in the book. Her grandpa wanted to buy her some new books because he said he is tired of reading this one. She already has other books. She just prefers this one."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I got this for my niece since I was planning on getting the book for her even before she came into our lives. It's a sweet & simple, classic bedtime story every child should have. Plus the stuffed bunny that comes with it is perfect. I thought it was a bit small at first, but it's actually just the right size for small children. I'd highly recommend this!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I was given a copy of this book 31 years ago for my newborn twins. Today I purchased a new copy of Goodnight Moon for my soon to be born granddaughter. My children still remember all the words and little nuances of how I read this to them so many times.I'm also buying Wynken, Blynken and Nod- another classic from so long ago, but such wonderful illustrations and words. You can't go wrong with these two classics for babies and older. Hope you enjoy these books as much as our family has!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"My daughter is 4 and this book is one the books I have to read to her every night..She loves it."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This is one of the all time favorites to add to your children's library. It is an especially great selection to read to children at bedtime. A wonderful selection for children having difficulty going to sleep at night."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"The Christmas EditionThis was a bedtime favorite of my children. Now our oldest is about to have her own child (its a boy). So I bought a parcel of books for the baby. When Kimberly saw this book, tears sprang in her eyes remembering me reading this to her while she sat on my lap. In a few more months someone new will be in her arms on her lap, and she will be reading this book to him."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"If you could have only one book on the shelf in your baby's room, it should be \\"Goodnight Moon\\" by Margaret Wise Brown. After my three children wore out the soft cover, I always purchase the board books. I give this as one of my gifts at every baby shower I attend. Bright colors, simple pictures, an easy storyline for toddlers to understand and words that lend themselves to an easy almost sing-song cadence...it was the last thing my children heard every night before they went to bed and a welcome part of their night time routine."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"From when I was a baby, untill modern day, his book has always been a charming read. I love the simple plot, colorful pictures, and the message reaches even the youngest readers. I recomend this book to parents, babysitters abd siblings alike. Truely a picture book classic."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This book was the sweetest childhood book I'v read.It is about a little rabit that can't go to sleep and thinks of many things. Even now I'm 10 sometime I pull it out and remember when I was little. SO if you have someone younger child in your family buy it today."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I am a preschool teacher and have a naproom full of toddlers. This book is requested every day at nap time. It is very sing-songy and the children love it! I cannot express how great this book is, it relaxes the children and they immediately drift off to sleep. If you have children, this book is a must for your library."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I purchased this book when my daughter was not quite 3 years old. It has been a nightly ritual that this book gets read to her. She has even read it to me several times and I love it.I have a very special man in my life who lives 800 miles away and I read it to him also. I have put him &quot;nite-nite&quot; several times. He says it's the rhythm I use while reading it.It is definitely a very soothing and relaxing book to read and listen to. Though, it may not make sense to some people who read to their children, I disagree and must say that this is the BEST BOOK on the market for babies and toddlers and well, children of all ages.I just recently found out that my sister is expecting her first child and you can bet I'll be giving this to her as a gift."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I was skeptical about the merits of this book at first as I read it to my daughter (1 year-old at the time, now 18 months). I was looking for some kind of cute plot and message, which is the format of most kids' books. However, I soon found that this was the book that she wanted out of the dozen or so that we read to her initially. It worked without fail to hold her attention, whereas other books left her looking around the room and squirming. I do believe that the alternating sequences of black and white and vivid colors, along with the very brief wording and soft word selections are masterful. This author somehow tapped into the psyche of infants and toddlers. The result? My daughter calls for \\"Moon\\" almost every night. And I'm glad to put her in a peaceful mood as she goes to bed."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This is a super book for young children. This one is a board book, so it's sturdy & friendly for little hands. Besides the book, you get a cute little pair of socks, all for one low price. We got this set for some friends of ours who were expecting their first child. The father immediately wanted to open the package and read the book. He said that it had been one of his favorite books as a child. It's a fun classic!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This is a wonderful bedtime book, both for parents and their children. I like the board book especially because it helps the younger ones feel a part of \\"reading\\" and hold the book which lasts a bit longer in that it is more sturdy. It is a special story for a special time in the evening and creates a cozy connection between parents and their kids. I raised all three of my \\"babies\\" on it and buy it for anyone I know who is having a new little one. The stuffed bunny is a fun addition."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This was the first book I wanted for my now 4-month-old, and I'm so glad. It's a definite part of our bedtime ritual (now that we have one), and I've enjoyed reading it to her since she was about 2 weeks old. Different pages grab her interest at different stages; initially she loved to stare at the cow jumping over the moon, and now it's the last page with the dimly lit room.This book has the best of all combinations: simple black and white images; bright color combinations; simple phrases; repetition. And as an adult, I've loved noticing the small details, such as the way the moon travels through the window space and the little bunny changes position to say goodnight to all his treasures.GRAB YOUR TISSUES: I recently posted some photos of my husband reading this to our baby on a message board. One of the women there said that the photos brought up some strong emotions, because she could hear her beloved late mother's voice reading those words to her even now. As I read this to Emily, I realize I may be creating lifelong memories of time with her mother and father. \\"Goodnight Moon\\" is the perfect book for this kind of magic."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Well what more can you say about a book that has been around and in print for over 50 years? Margaret Wise Brown's Goodnight Moon is a certified, bonafide classic. It is THE book for reading to infants and toddlers at bedtime. The simple, yet elegant prose of Ms. Wise Brown translates as well to kids now as they did back in 1947.The Illustrations by Clement Hurd perfectly compliment the poetry and is the kind os soothing book that really lulls kids to sleep..hopefully! This is the kind of book that can be kept and treasured through the years. Read with the kids and then the grandkids someday. Also, if you know people with kids of that age group, it makes a perfect gift as well. Anyone can appreciate a book of such high caliber. Wonderful book!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This must be the most classic storybook of all time. It was my favorite to read to my son at bedtime when he was younger. Margaret Wise Brown tells us in her book of the great green room (where a little rabbit is going to bed), describing first many of the delightful things around the room, and then we hear the little rabbit saying goodnight to the room, the moon, the cow jumping over the moon, and the other things that are in the room. I really like the part where there is a blank page and it says \\"goodnight nobody\\" and the next page is \\"goodnight mush\\". If you have a small child, this book is a must for bedtime reading! I was reading this book to my son when he was an infant, so it is never too soon to start. As a toddler, he never tired of hearing \\"Goodnight Moon\\" each night."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This book has been an absolute blessing for our toddler. We use to have a hard time getting her to bed at night but now when we say we'll read her the Goodnight Moon book she runs to bed. It truly is a classic! I recommend this board book over the paper version because if your child likes it the pages won't tear. Much more durable. Can't say enough about this book and we are a big book family. We have a membership to a book club but of all the books this has been the best one yet. And after a long day, it doesn't take forever to read."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"THIS IS A WONDERFUL BOOK TO READ JUST BEFORE BED TIME.

He really likes saying goodnight to nobody, and it's fun to hear him say goodnight to the things in Portuguese.Is it perfect? No, but it doesn't have to be. I'm not sure why it receives so many accolades, but since the book is so old and spans three generations, I strongly suspect nostalgia and projection are more at work here than actual perfection in writing or illustration.It's a very good book, and it launches my son and I on a laundry list of our own \\"goodnight this\\" and \\"goodnight that\\" when I turn out the light. My daughter and I will do this someday as well, and perhaps I'll have a different opinion of the book when they're older...-Fred"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"my son loves this book.

Everynight our ritual was to read this book right before he laid his head down and in a few short weeks began \\"reading\\" the book to me first and now he wants to read it to his younger brother before he goes to sleep.

It wasn't until I started reading Good Night Moon, that she became very interested and facinated by the pictures. It is the first book she has really become interested in, with the other books she just gets restless and usually knocks the book off my hands, which tells me she is not ready for them, although they are recommended for the same age group.

The balloon on the ceiling, the stars through the window, the fire in the fire place, the old woman in the chair...all of these are shown in the glory of their simple beauty.&quot;Goodnight Moon&quot; is about the simple pleasures of being at home and going to bed among familiar things...more than that, it is about the feeling of being loved--knowing and being known.Get this book. It is great for all ages."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"It's cute, it's rythmic and it's fun to read....but I don't get why everyone makes such a big fuss over it. I think \\"Where The Wild Things Are\\" or \\"The Hungry Caterpillar\\" are both much better.That being said, it's worth checking out of the library and reading to your child a time or two."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"When I first read this, I was a little confused, but then I realized that the BUNNY is going to sleep, not the moon. That changed things to the point where I would definitely consider this among my Top 16 favorite books of all-time. I would recommend the pop-up version, though. The mechanics of the red balloon garner sheer delight! So all in all, I think children will get a big kick out the rhyming (perfect meter, and effective use of repitition), and that the concepts of sleep and primary colors will grow on them more and more with each read. As long as he or she goes into the book knowing that moons don't sleep, I think this is an educational tool alerting children to the benefits of sleep indulgence."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"and neither does my 2-year-old daughter. She enjoyed it for about a month, but once she memorized it, she started telling me &quot;no thanks&quot; when I brought it out at bedtime. I received four copies of this book as gifts from friends who raved about it, but it's definitely not a favorite in our house."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"My wife and I read this book to our daughter almost every day. It's a great book, but I do have one complaint. What is up with the bowl full of mush? Who has a bowl full of mush hanging out on a table in the evening? No one thought to put it away? Not the old lady whispering hush? If this was Good Morning Moon I could see why there would be mush hanging around on a table with a brush, which by the way sort of grosses me out for some reason. Something about a brush full of hair right next to some cold bowl of mush. There's some sort of nasty kinetic energy about that. Like you might eat the mush even though it's cold and has been sitting there all day, and you end up partially swallowing a really long hair that you have to pull out of your throat. I get that mush rhymes with hush, and brush, and all that but please-a little realism if you don't mind. I have never once in my life had a bowl full of mush, next to a brush, on a table in the evening, that no one thought to put away.Except for that one thing, Good Night Moon is a great children's book."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"As a bookseller, I've just plain had enough of this book. It comes in several different forms and I've sold too many to count.But my opinion doesn't matter.The fact of the matter is, it's a great, soothing way to help get your child to sleep. Children need sleep rituals, and this book is a fine example of a sleep ritual. Saying goodnight to all of the things you love, knowing they'll still be there when you wake up.This book is comforting, and deserves its status as a perennial bestseller."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This is the only book that my wife and I have been able to read hundreds of times to our three children. It engages the child in a unique and evolving way and is really a joy for all. I give it to all my friends with new children."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This is a great book. No question. I heartily recommend the board book version, which will withstand the wear and tear a little better.Gift Buyers: beware. This is a popular gift choice (there is a nice gift set -- book and stuffed bunny). Just remember -- its everyone else's gift choice, too. Another great gift book by this author is The Runaway Bunny.Of course, if you get a non-board book version, chances are that the extra copies will come in handy, as pages can tear easily. This is sure to be a favorite."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I read that &quot;Goodnight Moon&quot; was a great book for bedtime. I discovered it was just fabulous. My daughter, who is two and four months old, absolutely loves this goodnight book. She knows practically all the words and we read it everynight."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I sent this to my 2-1/2 yr old granddaughter. She loves it. Her Mom or Dad reads it to her every night at her insistance and she had it memorized within the week. It must have been the first time she had heard a story being told in rhyming poetry. By the time she recites to the end of the story she's (almost) ready for bed. Grandma was a hit with this little treasure of a present."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I don't get it, I think the book is dull with it's colors and illustrations, but my child loves the book and reads it to herself a lot. Gotta get it!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This was a favorite of mine as child and as the parent of a three year old and an eighteen month old,I rediscovered this classic.Filled with whimsical illustrations and a charming,simple story,that even the youngest of children will love,this book will become an instant favorite.Not a night goes by that this book isn't read. Not just once but sometimes two or three times,to each child. Both children have their own copies and both love this story.This is the perfect book to help foster a lifelong love of books."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I cannot put my children to bed without reading this story at least once. The cadence is soothing, they wait for every word, and on first reading they love to end each sentance themselves with a squeal of delight. The second (or sometimes third or fourth) reading has my children rubbing their eyes, yawning, and cuddling into their pillows.When I turn off the big light, and the room is dim, I say &quot;goodnight noises everywhere&quot; to a pair of children who are comforted, sleepy and content.This book has magic."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This book is probably the best bedtime book ever. If read out loud slowly, taking the time to look at the pictures carefully (&quot;Where's Mr. Mouse now?&quot; or what is that picture of a rabbit fishing for, what, a bunny? with a carrot? - you find out if you also read Runaway Bunny.)it has an almost hypnotic effect--on adults as well as children. I have to admit at first I was baffled by the book (this is the classic that everyone raves about?), but my daughter and I now love it. And only Daddy can read it to her!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"A classic book that will never go out of style. Our little one chooses this book nightly for his bedtime reading. It's amazing to see his face light up when see's the &quot;Red Baloon&quot;! A must have for your little one(s)!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Part of the joy of this classic is letting the child participate in the story. After reading it a few times, your child will love to \\"read\\" it to you by pointing to the pictures, anticipating what you will say, etc. It is not only a relaxing story, but it is also a story to help with language skills, sequencing, and memory skills. Point out how the room becomes darker. Make the most of the illustrations as well as the text. It is more than just a book. It is an experience to share."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I loved this book as a teacher and now as a mom I had to have it for my daughter. She still hasn't fully appreciated the sweetness of the story but she is only 9 months and the pictures are most important right now. She is actually quite drawn to the contrast of the b/w pictures and the color pictures.Get the board book not the hardcover - I have both now because I bought the hardcover first."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Goodnight Moon was a staple in our house; read evey night, shared at sleepovers, read for every nap that didn't seem to come. No viloence. No innuendo of unhappiness. This is a classic children's book and I highly recommend it as a book that keeps little spirits in touch with nature and happily dreaming.Rayna Gangi, author, \\"Forget The Cures, Find The Cause.\\""},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This book is a timeless classic. Every parent should read it to their small children. It is a great way to end the day with a sweet good night."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Goodnight Moon is a MUST for all children!!I bought it for all my children,all three of my grandchildren,and many friends children!!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This book is great! You read the book in soft tone and it is perfect to your little one to sleep. My son on occasion request this book for bedtime. It is a great book to point out objects in the room.I think this book is calming that is why it is perfect for a bedtime story."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This has been a favorite of all my kids, which is why I bought one for a baby shower gift. The story is sweet and the board book holds up through multiple children."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Our 1 year old daughter loves this book. She is very focussed when we read to her and actually picks up the book to have us read it if she wants to be read to again."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"It's a classic - every child should have this book when they are very young."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"My 18 months baby loves this book. We have been reading it every night for a while now and we both enjoy it."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I bought this book based on reviews. When I first read it, I wasn't sure if my son would like it but I read it to him when he was several months old and now that he's 3, he still likes me to read this to him sometimes. I say the best books to read to children (even when they're just 3-4 months) is this one, Brown Bear Brown Bear and The Going to Bed Book - all of which have best reviews."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I discovered this book pretty late in life, and at first found it pretty odd, but have come to love it more and more. The poem is quite lovely and soothing (if a bit creepy, like old-time nursery rhymes) and the art is very striking and memorable."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"need I say more? Good Night Moon is the perfect \\"night, night\\" book. My son loves it! And so do I. I don't know which one of us enjoys it more :)I think looking at the sleepy bunny getting ready to go to bed somehow calms him because even if he is restless when we start he is yawning by the end."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"To be honest I really did not like this book when we received it as a gift for our newborn. There are black and white pages in between the color ones, rhymes are kind of wooden when spoken aloud, pretty much the same images over and over through out the book-I put it at the bottom of our growing stack of children's books.Fast forward a year. My little girl picks out books for Dad to read to her and one in particular is grabbed over and over, Good Night Moon. She starts pointing out things that I never really noticed, like the little mouse is in a different place on each color page. It became a game for us to \\"find the mouse\\". And she started following and anticipating the basic words patterns. And when I read to her \\"and a quiet old lady who was whispering.....\\" and I would pause. And then whisper quietly in her ear \\"...hush....\\" And soon she started to quietly whisper \\"hush\\" when I would pause.She is now 2 1/2 years old. She loves being read to every night before bed time and the book she chooses the most is still Good Night Moon. I now see the genius of the author. The black and white images are the dreams. The little old lady rocking in the child's bedroom while knitting until they fall asleep; the last page she is gone-mission accomplished. The perspective of the color pages changes slightly so there is always something new to find. It ends with \\"goodnight noises everywhere.\\" which maybe helps ease some of the fears of those unknown noises we heard as children by addressing them and, not only that, kindly telling them to have a good night.We now have a 4 month old little boy and I cannot wait to read this book for years to come."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This is the mainstay of any parent's bedtime story library. A great little story that may quickly soothe the hyperactive mind of your child, hopefully..."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"My children love the rhyme-like feel of this book's passages. By saying \\"goodnight\\", the child puts everything in its proper place and is finally ready for a night's sleep. My only criticism is that I wish the book was a little longer. My daughter is sometimes sad because the story ends, so I have to start from the beginning; but that is the sign of a good book."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This is a great bedtime story and is also great for pre-reading skills if you read it every night. My son even tries to read it to himself. Its a classic!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This is a fifteen page book of progressive learning for a toddler that provides the rhyme and rhythm for the rhythm of sleep. Each page is a rhyme or leads to one that introduces a new feature (a green room, three little bears in chairs, and mittens, and kittens), and a new word that is in the picture. Every third page is in color where the child can identify the new object that is in the room. A rabbit is tossing and turning trying to sleep before it finally does.This is very short and much beyond the age of a five year old, but it is perfect as words are being learned for the first time at ages 2 and 3. It is being sent to my great nephew, (the one who got theCloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Sea Turtlefor Christmas).I admit it is even better than \\"Barney Swallows a Whiny Kid and is Shot Dead,\\" a book I wrote thirty years ago for a demonic little child that has yet to be published.Pleasant dreams, David Lysander.Also recommended:Uncle Milton Moon In My Room"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Goodnight Moon Board Book & BunnyThe book arrived in time to be the gift I needed. As beautiful as when I bought it when my son was born-15 years ago. The accompanying bunny has changed but is still lovely. The baby who received it would not put the rabbit down. Bed-time reading for any generation."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Goodnight Moon was the last book I read to my daughter every night before turning out her light. I added a photo of her to the blank page at the end of the book, so she was the last to receive the goodnight message. This continued for a long time, and to this day, I can recite much of this beautiful book by heart. Now my daughter is an adult, and I have given the book to her friends who are new parents. If you are looking for a gift that will be treasured by everyone in the family I highly recommend Goodnight Moon. I wish Margaret Wise Brown could see how many people of all ages love her incredibly sweet, touching book."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"All six of my grandchildren have been lulled to sleep by this kind and gentle nighttime story. A great gift for a baby shower. Grandparents should also keep a copy for the little ones' visits."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Only reason why I gave it 2 stars is because I thought it was the small miniature version of the book, rather than a very large copy."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I ordered several books for my kids for Christmas and as baby shower gifts. I wanted books that reminded me of my childhood and that I think are classics. This book arrived with no problems."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I would definitely recommend this item to other parents. It is a nice traditional board book which I am sure my little one will enjoy."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Good Night Moon almost never fails to lull your child, grandchild or baby sittee to sleep. The pictures are wonderful. There always seems to be a new detail in the illustrations that I have never seen before. I have not tried the audible book as I love turning the pages as I read it to my various little ones. I have given this book as a shower gift at least 15 times and it has always (eventually) been appreciated."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I bought this book thinking it was the hardcover (because it somehow got listed under that category), but couldn't return it because it was a Christmas gift for someone & I wouldn't have had enough time to get another.It was in great condition, though, and when the sellers found out that I had bought the wrong one, they apologized and refunded the item. It was the first time something like this had happened. I was very surprised and pleased. They have a lot of integrity."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I got this book for my son for Christmas. The book is great and it's soft just like a pillow. I still feel its a tad bit on the pricey side for a 2 page book but the book is nicely made and not your average book... And it won't rip like other books! All in all it was a lovely gift to my 16 month old."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This &#34;tried and true&#34; book is one of my favorites to give to parents of newborns. The cardboard edition makes perfect sense for little hands."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Read this book to my baby who is still in utero. I love the simple story and hope she will too!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Wonderful storyline. A perfect bedtime story for any child. Wonderful illustrations with few words which helps young readers to learn how to read."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"i like that the book is brightly colored. and that i can point to a picture associated with every word \\"comb\\", \\"brush\\", \\"house\\", \\"moon\\", \\"over the moon\\", etc. we have found a new purpose for this book at every age level since we got it (to establish a bedtime routine, to learn new words, to learn new primary colors), we've had it since our son was 6 mths old, he is now 18 mths old."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"My 17 months old son received this book as a gift last week. He doesn't like to read all kind of books. I don't buy this book to him as it may be too early for him and it seems he won't be interested to this book. But it comes up to be totally wrong! He is interested to this book and read all the pages, it really surprise me! He reads this book every day! I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Bought this for some friends who were having a baby as it was one of my daughters favorite books when I recieved it it was a larger size version than what we had very nice good price."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Margaret Wise Brown, &lt;strong>Goodnight Moon&lt;/strong> (Harper, 1947)How does one review a classic? Especially when one is going to say it isn't perfect? Don't get me wrong, I love this book, and I've long lost count of the number of times I've read it over the years, both as a child myself in the sixties and seventies and reading it to my kids in the nineties and now. And maybe my problem with it is as minor as minor comes (the rhythm, impeccable in the rest of the book, hits a snag on the line \\"and a young mouse\\", which is missing a syllable necessary to keep it in line with everything else). But still... you'd think in a book this short the author would pay that much more attention to each line, wouldn't you? Not that you need me to tell you--I don't think I've ever met anyone who has never encountered &lt;em>Goodnight Moon&lt;/em> before--but you'll jar on that line the first time you hit it. Otherwise... perfect. ****"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This book, by the late Margaret Wise Brown, lets us explore the rabbit in it's natural habitat. Which apparently is a 19th Century nursery. Pajam'ed and incredibly aware of his surroundings, our hero is a tiny bunny preparing for a night in, taking meticulous inventory of all his surroundings. My own sons, both of a limited verbal proficiency are able to enjoy the short text on each page, and the intermittent usage of color and then b&w illustration mixes things up. This is the first book in a series of surreal books by the author and her illustrator, and the recurrence of the paintings in the latter work feels like some sort of proto-hipster self referencing. But then again, Marge was probably one of the more rock 'n roll childrens book authors of all time, so why should we be surprised?"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I loved this book as a small child, I have no idea whats with the negative reviews. 1 year old infants are fickle and have short attention spans. If your child doesn't like it, they don't like it. But should we really judge a book off of the taste of child who cannot yet speak?"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This book wasn't in our personal library when my daughter was born in 1975 in CA and most often I made up stories for her. She was reading at three so whatever I did it must have been productive, intellectually, for her. When I first saw this, she was a teenager and not interested in such childish things (although she still loved the stories I created for her). When she and my son-in-law gave birth to their first child in March of this year, I knew it was something that was going to be a part of her life. The day it arrived my daughter called to say \\"guess who fell asleep after being read a certain book?\\". Of course we know at one month just the sound of her mother's voice was the trick that put her to sleep but as the months progress, this book will follow in the history of \\"Pat the Bunny\\" and soon she will be reading by memory, then by recognition, word by word.A beautiful, other-worldly story."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"My grandson is 20 months old and loves the colors and size of the pictures. His only problem is he wants to turn the large pages. He just needs extra help. This has quickly become his favorite book."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Inexpensive, and good book to foster relationship with toddlers. Highly recommended. We spent some good time reading this book, rotating with the caterpillar and other series."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This simple book was read to my mom, who in turn read it to me, and now I love to read this to my 2 and 4 year old. The text is very simple, but the detail in illustration is delightful. As I read, I lower my voice on each page. The last line is a whisper, and it has me nodding off!! Such a calming, sleep inducing story. Sweet dreams!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I received the book in ok shape. Granted, I was searching for used books so I am not completely blameless in this interaction. However, I would've liked to have known that the book had been drenched in some kind of brown liquid that had wrinkled the pages and ripped the cover. I am a teacher in a very low-income school/city - so I know about making do with faulty products. However, this one left little to be desired from it. On the positive side - the item arrived in record time and my students have enjoyed it greatly."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Goodnight Moon has been a classic for years. My children loved it, and I have been giving the book as a gift for years. I had the pleasure of giving Goodnight Moon to my grandchild two years ago. Actually, reading the book softly not only puts the child to sleep, it also completely relaxes the reader - not a bad thing either!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Goodnight Moon is a classic. Bright colors that my 10 month old loves, good story for the 5 year old, & easily read for the 6 year old. My family loves this one!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"It seems like most kids like this one, and adults either like it or dread it being picked AGAIN for bedtime reading. My husband and I happen to love it, as there's a certain kind of delicious absurdity to saying \\"Goodnight\\" to every last damn thing in that great green room, including \\"nobody\\" and \\"the air\\", but I don't give this one as a gift. I've met too many adults who will confess to having hidden it behind the bookcase after the eleventy-umpth reading-on-demand."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"30 years ago I bought this book for my baby daughters and now it is \\"my go to book\\" for my new grandson.

The book is really fun."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I know we're supposed to read to our boy every night. It's difficult for me. My wife is better. His grandparents are much better. He doesn't much care for some books and I can easily understand why. It just seems to take a special knack to reach some children. Well, one book he really loves is \\"Midnight Moon\\" by Margaret Wise Brown. He likes to go over it again and again, even on his own. It's amazing. Plus, it's helped him to recognize all sorts of things around the house and in his external environment. When he points upward and says \\"Moon\\" at night I know exactly where it came from. Interesting! Personally, I think it's really corny, but I'm not the one to judge. Based on his continuing interest, I'd say this is positively one of his better books.Gary Peterson"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"We have this must-have classic children's book in English and in Spanish, and we love it. Somewhere around 18 months, my son began the hunt for the mouse, which cleverly appears somewhere different in every picture of the room... including one where he's snacking on the oatmeal.And we call the old lady bunny Grandma Bunny which (for some reason) is also hilarious.The book is full of objects that children see every day, and the pages with the object pictures help them learn what those things are (also great to learn Spanish). And, of course, it's a natural segwey to saying good night to everything in the room and going to bed!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I started reading Goodnight Moon to my son at 4 months of age and it became his favorite bedtime story. When he reached about 9 months I started pointing out objects to him and naming them for him, like the cat, moon, fireplace, red balloon etc. Before long he'd point them out to me as I read. He's nearly 2 and he still enjoys this book, although he gets to choose each night and he often now chooses another book. I know he still likes it though, and he still will point out things to me. I think this is a great book to get someone as a gift or just to add to your baby/toddlers library."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I got this book from friends several years back and thought then that it was cute, but now that I have a one year old son I think it is GREAT! My son absolutely adores this book and we have to read it to him every evening before he goes to bed. He also carries it around with him during the day (first thing he picks off the shelf in his room), and it seems to give him a great sense of comfort.Personally, I love the way the book is set up with the repetition of the same motifs and the gradual darkening of the room. So clever! The repetitiveness also is great for fostering cognitive development. My son now recognizes a few items in the book and points them out as I read it to him.I can't wait for the moment when we can together say goodnight to all the different objects in his room at the end of the day. What a great way to end a child's day and help him get comfortable in his room and ready for the night."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This book has certainly stood the test of time.My nieces read this book as children and now they are adults.I like this book.Although it may seem somewhat simplistic to some adults it is for a young child. As one reviewer commented \\"it put me to sleep\\", isn't that what it is supposed to do? It is a book about going to bed.To me, it de-mystifies the the things in a child's room that may seem scary to them once the lights are out. If you help the child identify the items in their room, then they are not so frightening in the dark. Of course, this is only my perception.Haven't so many of us experienced seeing an object in our room as a child, in the dark and it looks like something it's not? Then you turn the light on and discover it is only your teddy bear."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"as part of the bedtime routine for my now 18 mo old boy. Of course, I am able to recite it by rote after oh, about 10,000 times. I don't even have to pay attention any more, as he knows where to turn the pages. Why do I keep doing this night after night? Because every time I ask him if he's ready for his story, he giggles with delight and runs to get Goodnight Moon, and Brown Bear, the other book of our nightly ritual. Brown Bear always comes first, Goodnight Moon always comes last. In between, we vary it with others, like Polar Bear, Polar Bear, What Do You Hear; Quick as a Cricket; Are You My Mother; The Very Hungry Caterpillar; Thomas the Tank Engine; etc. I love Goodnight Moon for making that sweet little boy express such delight at reading it."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"A classic bed-time book that shows the psyche's of a child who doesn't want to sleep. What's a child to do when they want to postpone sleep? Say goodnight to everything from kittens to mittens and when you can't think of anything, say goodnight to nobody. A classic example of what happens when a great writer collaborates with a genius illustrator. There are so many things going on that the first few times you read it there is something new you discover. The gradually darkening of the room, the bunny turning around to say goodnight to the bears and the mouse! Where is the mouse? A somber book made fun...."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"A bedtime story that wraps a child in comfort and security.

Reading it to my toddler daughter is like reading a poem. I started on this book when my daughter was almost 1 year old. It was a bit late, she should have started on it earlier. She loves it. My daughter always sits on my lap when I read the book. She would turn her head around to smile at me everytime I read through a particular part of the story. My daughter is now 15 months, everytime when I pick up this book and starts to read to her, she would start to suck her thumb and know that it is time to sleep. At this moment, she likes this book the most among other story books."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I had a pleasure to read this to a preschooler, or two, finding this story intriguing.Young children may handle this book better, because of its short, and the pictures are eye catching!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I bought this book together with Runaway Bunny. My daugther fell in love with Good Night Moon only. She loves looking for little mouse and loves to look at the nice illustrations and listen to lovely rhymes. At the end, we say good night to things in her room as well.What I wish is maybe to have all ilustrations in color (some are in black and white).But overall, this is lovely book, strongly recommend it."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I have been reading to my son since he was a newborn and like other viewers it wasn't obvious to me why he would like this book.

Saying goodnight to multiple objects through a rhyme is soothing while a brightly lit colorful room grows dimmer and dimmer.Also the bright pages are interlaced with back and white pages with simpler pictures which works well in terms of keeping the pace right and not over stimulating him as a bedtime story.I did a lot of research in picking his first board bks and he thoroughly enjoys all of them. Highly Recommended!1. Goodnight Moon (bed time)2. The Big Red Barn (bed time)3. The Very Hungry Caterpillar4. The Runaway Bunny5. Pat the Bunny (not exactly a board book)"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Don't listen to the one- and two-star people!\\"Goodnight Moon\\" is the quintessential bedtime book. It is worded perfectly for a relaxed pace and soothing tone from the reader, as well as a nice poetic rhythm. The little bunny in the story says goodnight to objects in the room as he goes to bed; you can continue from this book to say goodnight to objects in your child's own room. As you read, watch the moon rise and the time change on the clocks, and remember to look around the room for the mouse!I am perplexed by the reasons given by some reviewers as to why they don't like this book. As for boredom, any adult can become bored with a children's book of this level when it's read over and over and over (and over), as children of this age require of you. \\"Goodnight Moon\\" is not aimed at adults. That obvious fact being said, I have *never* been bored with this long-memorized book in four years of reading it (over and over and over), because it is so well written.One current reviewer claims there is no lyricism or poetry to the words, which left me agape -- anyone who can speak English decently well could feel the rhythm and lyricism in the text, and read it accordingly. Was she reading a different book?To the reviewer who noted the \\"tired catalogue of meaningless objects,\\" remember that small children need repetition to learn -- \\"Read it, Papa, read it (over and over and over)!\\" -- and no objects are meaningless to them. They are curious about everything; it is we adults who often narrow our curiosity too much, teaching our children to do likewise. And of course, the worth of artwork is always a matter of opinion -- he is obviously a \\"modern art\\" person from his other reviews, so he knows this very well. I too like Jackson Pollock's work, but I also happen to like Clement Hurd's \\"shrilly colored, crudely drawn, flatly artless illustrations\\" in this book and would not describe them that way. The colors are bright monochrome (a bit garish) and they contrast starkly; the drawings are simple and basic: it's a valid style, and it draws the child's attention. But anyway, his recommendation of D.B. Johnson's \\"Henry Builds a Cabin\\" is great; the book looks and sounds fantastic, so I'll order it. I too look for children's books with an eye to the artistic quality of illustrations.Our older daughter (4.5) loved this book from the age of 6 months or so, and the younger (20 mos.) has too, although she loves the author's \\"The Runaway Bunny\\" better. We replaced tattered, well-loved paperbacks of both these books with the big lap edition board books which, though heavy, are great for the size of the illustrations and are virtually indestructible. The baby carries the lighter, tattered copies hither and thither, though she will heft the big ones also.\\"Goodnight Moon\\" is a wonderful book. Your child will love it."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"In our family \\"Goodnight Moon\\" has recently become a \\"read-every-night book.\\" As the bunny calmly says goodnight to everything inside and outside the window, our children seem to feel a comforting sense of predictability, security and peace as they wind down for sleep. Part of our current bedtime ritual also includes pointing out the mouse in each color illustration. My husband and I enjoy reading books with our two sons, ages 3 and 5. Many are simply for pure fun and enjoyment together. However, we have also found that some books serve as a wonderful opportunity for us to continue teaching a lesson about our family rules and values. We often calmly revisit a situation with our boys, away from the heat of the moment of their embarrassing angry behavior (by reading \\"Elbert's Bad Word\\" or \\"How Are You Peeling?\\"; or we may wish to prepare ahead of time for a situation (by reading \\"Daddy, Will You Miss Me?\\"). When we are unsure of the appropriate words to use, a book can ofte! n get the point or lesson across to a young child in just the right way. Sometimes, the text or pictures can encourage the child to ask questions or make comments, thereby giving you a clearer sense of his understanding. Then you can focus further discussion as needed. We found an awesome annotated listing of excellent books to read with 2- to 5-year-olds in \\"The Pocket Parent\\". This pocket-sized A-Z compendium addresses many hot-button subjects and includes more than 100 recommended picture books to broach sensitive or worrisome issues with your preschoolers--such as Anger, Bedtime, Bad Words, Biting, Death, Gimmes, \\"I Hate You's\\", Lying, Mealtime, Morning Crazies, The New Baby, Strangers, Thumb sucking, Tantrums, Whining and more. Reading appropriate books, like \\"Goodnight Moon\\", is definitely one effective way to establish comforting routines with the children while keeping lines of communication open to discuss concerns and solve problems together when needed."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I could probably recite this book in my sleep, and there's no reason our kids shouldn't grow up with the same warm fuzzy feelings when they think of this book and its soothing, reassuring bedtime rhymes.And, if you're lucky enough to still have your parents, they can delight your kids by starting the story with, \\"your mommy/daddy used to LOVE this book, when he/she was your age...\\" As they say in the ads... Priceless."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I loved reading this book to my 2 year old. When she had it memorized I would pause and let her fill in the blanks. I think that reading it out loud in a soft voice that gets even softer adds to the magic."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"My two year old grandson loves being read to. He has many books but this one is his very favorite. He doesn't tire of having it read over and over again. He noticed the position of the moon changes in the window in each frame and the young mouse is in a different place as well. Buy it. You'll love it."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Not too many nights go by with me or mommy getting away with not reading this book to our daughter at bedtime, at least twice.Last night we couldn't find it (aka I was too tired to look for it) so we turned out the light and recited the book from memory. I just love to hear her say, &quot;Goodnight nobody.&quot;This is a great first book for a child just starting to master speech.There are also neat things in the illustrations you can point out to your child, like where's the mouse in this picture? (He moves around from page to page.)"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I read this book to my 2 year old son everynight and he loves it. My son loves the bright colors and the different items in the room that we find together like the mouse and the socks and the telephone. We both find confort in this story before we go to sleep."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"It's hard to get away with wearing bunny slippers when you're an adult, but on babies they sure are cute! This set is a good gift risk, in case the baby already has 6,000 copies of Goodnight Moon."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"A few weeks ago i was looking for a copy of this book for my 6 month old cousin, and my boyfriend just happedned to be in the store with me, and he said he had never heard of good night moon. I told him he was seriously deprived as a child not having read this book, it is a must have for all children, it will lull them to sleep before you know it. I remeber fondly my parents reading this book to me as a child, and since that time i have been deovouring everybook i can get my hands on, but this one always brings back the magic of our childhood."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This is a great book for children all the way from infancy on up.

Goodnight Moon helps put kids to bed everynight! Thank You Ms. Brown!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"One of the classic baby books. It has stood the test of time, and been beloved by infants and toddlers for over 50 years. There is a simplicity and comfort that soothes little ones before bedtime.Reading it creates a wonderful bond between parents and children.This board book is packaged with baby socks and makes a thoughtful gift to new babies."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"&quot;In the great green room, there was a telephone and red balloon . . .&quot; This was the first book that I read to my daughter. She continued to enjoy it until she was two and a half years old, and now, at the ripe old age of four, although she has advanced to books of much greater complexity, she still asks for it from time to time. Goodnight Moon is quietly entertaining, from the simple, rhythmic text (which lends itself more to chanting than to reading) to the marvelous illustrations of the strangely soothing &quot;great green room&quot; which grow darker as the story progresses and the bunny gets closer bed time.As your child grows older, he or she will enjoy finding the elusive baby mouse on each of the colored illustrations. The appeal of this book is somewhat inexplicable, but it is both timeless and enchanting."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This little board book and bunny make this package a memory for long time use.Being a classic \\"read me a bedtime story\\", and being the size for a small child to handle, you can't beat Goodnight Moon for infants through kindergarten. Great package!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I received three GOODNIGHT MOON books as gifts when my baby was born, and now I know why! GOODNIGHT MOON is a soothing, rhythmic book. It is one of two books that lulls my baby to sleep every night.The alternating color and black-and-white pictures are soothing and calming. The bright green colored pictures gradually become darker and darker as sleepy time approaches. The words are melodic and can even feel hypnotic if read in a certain way."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Goodnight Moon is a classic. It is one of the sweetest and most lovely books you can read to your child at bedtime. I read this book to my children each night, and they loved the book, felt peaceful, safe, as this book brings children a most beautiful story. If you love your children \\"above the moon and stars, and over the universe\\" then this is the book to buy and read at bedtime. Deserves 10 Stars!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I have a friend who has recently become an elementary school teacher and is teaching kindergarten. She talked me into coming in to read to her class--any book(s)I wanted to bring with me.My reading gig is coming up this week so this past weekend I asked my 16 year old daughter to go through her old children's books (she has 50-60 of her old favorites still on a bookshelf in her room) and she emerged with 2 or three books for the kid's but also with Goodnight Moon--which she wanted me to read to her.As Miss Zoe was growing up we'd read every night and Zoe (my daughter) got to choose what we read. She'd usually pick 2 to 3 books and, for years and years, Goodnight Moon was always one of them.The book itself is somewhat inexplicable--mostly it's just a silly little poem, really--but for my kids it really struck a chord. All I know is that if your sixteen year old daughter wants to curl up on the couch and have you read one of her childhood books to her, that's quite a book.I always give this to friends when they have a first baby, and I have always found that a few years later they are still telling me it is their kid's favorite book.So don't try to figure it out, just buy it and read it to your kids. It'll be a treasure you share for years."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"My 18 month old son absolutely ADORES this book. I'll have to admit, I find the colors garish, and the illustrations I might have doodled myself, but this is by far my kid's favorite book. The cadence is soft and musical, and I can't believe that my son can point out the mouse on every single page. Point it out? He practically bashes the book out of my hands trying to show it to me. He always wants this book before he goes to sleep at night, and it's a joy to read to him. An absolute MUST for any nursery shelf. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"If you could have only one book on the shelf in your baby's room, it should be \\"Goodnight Moon\\" by Margaret Wise Brown. After my three children wore out the soft cover, I always purchase the board books. I give this as one of my gifts at every baby shower I attend. Bright colors, simple pictures, an easy storyline for toddlers to understand and words that lend themselves to an easy almost sing-song cadence...it was the last thing my children heard every night before they went to bed and a welcome part of their night time routine."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Excellent book for young children. A wonderful tale that lives on with any child. A great read to book for parents and grandparents alike. Buy it, the kids will love it!!!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I too was once a sceptic as to why everyone liked this book. My niece used to love it and I hated reading it to her. Now that I have my own child (3 months old), it is one of the simplest books to read to him before bed. As soon as I utter those first words, he gets a huge smile on his face. We read it every night and have since he was about 6 weeks old. I just love the basic story and rhyme, and I think the basic colors on the pages are appealing to little ones. I got 5 copies at my shower. Highly recommend."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I have the sweetest memories of my (now grown) children sitting in my lap as we read this at bedtime. They each enjoyed trying to spot the mouse and the items mentioned on each page. Don't just softly read it to them but also let them interact with it by asking them, \\"Where's the mouse?\\", or \\"Where are the mittens?\\". This book is always included in my baby gifts to friends and family to get them off to a good start to a lifetime love of reading and to create sweet times together."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"my daughter looks foward to me reading this book at bedtime, she's 11 months old"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This is a really cute set.

Everyone was familiar with the book but didn't know it came with the bunny. (The bunny is the main character in the book) Nicely packaged. Ready to gift wrap."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I haven't heard of one child who didn't absolutely love this book. Make this part of your bedtime routine--it does wonders! This book could easily get destroyed by little ones because of the thin pages, so make sure you keep it safe.

It's the perfect bedtime book for any child 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 years of age.You simply MUST get this book!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This was my 4 year old and is my 2 year old's favorite book (the older one now likes Green Eggs and Ham). I just ordered this version with the bunny, and I can't wait to get it! This is the third book we will have gotten, as the first two were read so many times that they each wore out (even though the second was the board book lol). There's a cute video by HBO that is Goodnight Moon and other bedtime stories like Nightmare in My Closet, and Tar Beach. My kids love the video too. Great, great story."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I buy this book for every new baby. It's been around for about 60 years and hope it never goes out of print. Babies love the sounds that the words make. It's a must!!!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"My Daughter and I read this book nightly. We say Goodnight to the \\"Great green room\\" in the same rhythmic way every night. The familiarity of the book creates a ritual for us, we know as soon as we say goodnight to the \\"noises everywhere\\" next she gets bedtime kisses and then she snuggles into bed. As your child grows they can learn the names of other items in the room and create correlations, they can explore the solid colors and concepts (i.e. my daughter learned to point out Fire and say hot, and she recognized the window although not directly named) this helps to build their critical thinking skills. The book is like a tranquilizer for her little brain. We read a lot as a family through out the day, but we always read this last before bed."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This children's book is the perfect bed-time book. A must have in any child's collection"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"My cousin sent me this book when my first child was born. She said she gave it to everybody she knew when they had their first baby. I now do the same, and you will too. If there were a genre called \\"lullaby books\\" this book would define it. \\"Goodnight Moon\\" begins with a wonderful picture of a room filled with comforting, familiar objects, including a grandma bunny rabbit knitting in a rocking chair and pictures on the wall depicting scenes from nursery rhymes. The book's words, in poem-form, say Goodnight to the objects in the room one-by-one as you turn the pages. But the fun lies in finding the little mouse that appears in the accompanying pictures of the room. You will find yourself, with your child, pretending not to see where the mouse is. \\"Where is he? Do you see him?\\" Then a delighted \\"There he is!\\" Yes, all's right with the world. You found the mouse, again. Time to turn off the lights. Time to sleep."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"My son really enjoys hearing and looking at this book...he likes the old lady saying hush the best....that is what he calls the book when he wants to read it....hush!

We read to her every night and this book is one of our favorites. I admire the illustrations and the easy rhythm of the language. I love the blank page with \\"Goodnight, nobody\\" on it. Very amusing.This is an excellent gift for a young child."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I love all of the Margaret Wise Brown books. And this one is no exception. There is so much to look at. Only enough energy to read the words? Fine, a soothing rhythmic lullaby. More energy? There is enough in the book to keep you going for at least a half hour looking at engaging characters, sleepy kitties, curious mice and warm mittens that have dried in front of the fire. Although I agree with a reviewer that the sudden disappearance of the quiet old lady is creepy and fodder for a Dr. Who episode. Otherwise, a great kids book."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I've been reading this book to my son since he was little bitty. He's 19 months now and still loves it.

The book has an unusual, lyrical quality to it that he loves.

It's a must have for small kids!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"My son LOVES this book, and it's one of his (and my) bedtime favorites. It's a good, low-key book that's perfect for bedtime.

Just a fun book!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Our 2 year old son just loves this book. He asks us to read it to him every night, often multiple times.

This is a must have, and my family will cherish it forever."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"\\"Goodnight Moon\\" is the book my nephews always ask for before they go to bed, and I don't blame them. A soothing rhythm and quiet, sleepy illustrations make this the perfect bedtime story for little ones. It's amazing how simple the story seems, yet it works like a charm: by the end, my nephews are heavy-lidded and peaceful. This book has been in my family for a long time; my mother read it to me, and my sisters now read it to their children. If I have kids of my own someday, \\"Goodnight Moon\\" is the first story I plan on reading to them."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"My 18 month old daughter loves this book.

It has also become a favorite. If you like Margaret Wise Brown's work, you have to get Runaway Bunny!! Its another favorite in our house!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This is a magical book that seems to fascinate young children. This was the most favorite book of my first daughter when she was a toddler and now my second daughther is also absolutely in love with it. It is a great book for a short reading before going to bed. It is also a great book for a child to keep next to his/her pillow at night. Both of my children loved looking for and finding the little mouse on the color pages. They also liked reading this book aloud to themselves again and again. Alternating color and black and white illustrations and simple text seem to resonate very well with children of toddler age.\\"The Moon Book\\" is the \\"best book ever\\" for toddlers."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Goodnight Moon is a definite favorite in our house. I've been reading it to my 23 month old son for as long as I can remember, and he asks for it by name.

The pictures never caught my daughter's eye and there are other books with much better rhymes. I got a much better reaction from my daughter with books by Eric Caryle, Dr. Seuss, Sandra Boynton, Richard Scarry, and Karen Katz. She often comes to me carrying a book by one of these other authors so I could read it to her, but she's never voluntarily picked up this one."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I have tried to read this a dozen times to our toddler and he just has no interest.

Got it for the excellent reviews. We have almost all of the sandra boynton books that my 2 year old loves.

Not worth the price IMO."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This is a classic BEDTIME story. Some of the other people's comments were really dumb. Why are you looking for a stimulating, laugh-out-loud book to put your little ones to sleep. Why are you trying to read it to a 9 yr old while he's playing video games. The book doesn't suck, you suck and your purpose for buying it. It is definitely for babies and toddlers. Plus parents we have to remember that any book can be boring depending on how you read it. You aren't suppose to like it, you're grown and don't have the mind of a small child.

First of all, it's not meant to be for them. It's meant to be for little toddlers and babies. Second of all, it's meant to be a bedtime story, and a very good one at that. There's no action, nothing surprising, or anything like that. But it has a very calm atmosphere, and like I said, is very soothing and comfomfortable for yor baby and/or toddler to listen to. This story-like poem almost guaranties to make your child sleepy, and maybe even fall fast asleep. It worked for my siblings and me!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"My daughter asks for this book every night without fail. The edges are chewed and it shows the signs that it is her favorite story. We love the board book version and are thrilled to have it! The story is timeless and the pictures are so clear and fun. My daughter loves picking out the things named on the pages and the size of the board version is just right for her to handle. This should definitely be in every child's bedtime story collection!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"The beautiful book is so simple, in both words and illustrations, that it is almost stark, but rather that making the book cold, the style simply strips away everything that is extraneous, leaving behind a warmth and tenderness that has now delighted several generations of children.There are many good children's books and a number of great ones. This one, however, transcends into the realm of indispensible literature for the very young. This is one of a handful of books that one must--absolutely must--not only read but own and cherish."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I do not live in States and my native language is not English therefore I had my hesitations buying the book to my kids. One of them 3 ,the other one is 6 years old and they loved the book! Everynight before going to bed I read the book outloud to them and they repeat what I say and they loved this poetic book..I suggest you buy it even if your kids do not know english :)"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"BEWARE! you will have to read this book a minimum of 2,000 times once your toddler hears it. All 3 of my children have loved this book until it is worn out, and we have bought at least 4 Goodnight Moons.It can be a wonderfully interactive book once they have heard it enough times to anticipate what is coming. With a little help they will have a wonderful time pointing to the items in the pictures, and finishing the sentences for you. Each of mine memorized the entire book. You cannot go wrong with this book!!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I bought this book for my boyfriend to give to his Godson for Christmas. When I was a baby my Godmother gave me a copy, and it became one of my most treasured possesions. The cadence of the story is perfect for putting a small child to sleep and the pictrues are recognized by people the world over."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This is the best bedtime story ever! It is so simple and familiar, that's why my daughter and neices loved this book so much. The board book is perfect for little hands to turn the pages. Hint: There is a tiny mouse on each page, and we always played a game where the kids had to find the mouse before turning the page. This book makes a great baby shower gift and is small enough to carry in the diaper bag."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This has been revered book in the USA for a generation and rightly so. It has a simple text with lovely illustrations and the repetition will lull a child to sleep. I have given many copies to friends with small children to ease the end of the day."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Goodnight Moon is a wonderful bedtime book. It switches between black & white and color pages. It is a very simple, calm story that lulls a child to sleep. I received it as a gift when my first child was born. I now give it as a gift at all baby showers I attend."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This is one of the best books out for children. Great bedtime book, and the illustrator creatively made it appear darker and darker as bedtime approaches. My girls say night-night to the bunny every night. Love the book!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"\\"Goodnight Moon\\" succeeds beyond such sobriquets as \\"classic\\" or \\"perfect,\\" for this work is that rarest achievement in art and letters: a melding of the visual with the sonic, and always presented in an atmosphere of intimacy and security. This provides a psychological construct for healthy learning that is imperative for a child's growing mind and emotional maturation. Only the Christmas Story of the Gospel of Luke, Chapter 2, is superior in Western literature in nurturing a child's introduction to mapping the world with words, built from visual clues. \\"Goodnight Moon\\" is an indispensable foundational work for a child's confident construct of the spoken, written and read English language. The dimension of emotional comfort invoked with this work cannot be overstated.What makes this work so remarkable? In contrast to the mad world of Dr. Suess, where made-up words serve with legitimacy of ancient ones, the vocabulary of \\"Goodnight Moon\\" is normal. In addition, the rhyming scheme, the scansion, the subject, and the illustrations are all both in perfect balance and contrast that engage the child on both the whole (the sentence, or the whole illustration) and the specific (the individual word, or a visual detail in the pictures). This is a small comprehensible world, invoked with poetics and illustrated with grace.It is in the processes of reading aloud, pointing to pictures and words, with the repetition of familiar themes (\\"goodnight\\") and subjects (objects in a nursery) that the concept of printed words signifying objects (both illustrated ones, and real ones) and actions becomes incarnate in a child's mind. Ricoeur's \\"the symbol gives rise to the thought\\" has its birthplace here. This is the ideal vehicle to begin your child's journey of mastering comprehension and action of and in the world with symbols.We own the board book edition, and I highly recommend it for its sturdy use for each new member of a growing family.This is the first book our six year old daughter was able to read to her two year old brother, a moment all families should experience. I urge you to read \\"Goodnight Moon\\" regularly to your child as a gift for his future."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Now that I have a son I realize why this book was given to me 5 times. It is so sweet and simple with beautiful colors. The book is soothing. My son always hands it to me to read. A real classic."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"To those of us who raised our children on this book, nudging them toward sleep each night with one more, please Mommy, just one more book and please Mommy, please make it Goodnight Moon, the opening lines will always be familiar: In the great green room there was a red balloon - - - and finally there was a spoon and a brush and a bowl full of mush, and a quiet old lady whispering \`Hush.'As you slowly turn the pages, drinking in the images, you begin to notice things. The room gets darker with each page, the hands of the clock progress. The mouse is always there, but it is sometimes hard to find him. The kittens get drowsy, and so does the bunny. There's less mush in the bowl. And most of all the moon rises; in each picture it's a little higher above the windowsill.Simply brilliant.Always enough to make a tired parent drowsy, for sure, and usually it works for the child, too! This classic book should be given to every first-time pregnant mom at her baby shower."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I love to read this book to my son before he goes to bed. I never tire of it and recently he pointed out to me that the mouse is on every page. Now we look for the mouse and love when the old lady whispers hush!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This is my daughters favorite book! Every night before she went to bed she would says &quot;Goodnight Mom, Goodnight Moon&quot;. I ordered this book in hardback and gave it to her for her 16th birthday. She had tears in her eyes when I gave it to her and although she hadn't said it in a long time, she came up behind me that night and whispered in my ear &quot;Goodnight Mom, Goodnight Moon&quot;. She is leaving for college in the fall but has already packed a little comfort from home; her &quot;Goodnight Moon&quot; book."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"We don't have fights over bedtime in our house. I credit our routine, of which &quot;Good Night Moon&quot; is a big part. This has been the last book my two-year-old daughter and I have read every night for the last 18 months. The end of this book, &quot;Good night noises everywhere&quot;, means it's time to go to bed and it works every time.The wonderful illustrations allow us plenty of time to point out and name things in the room. And, as the room gets progressively darker, don't be too surprised if your eyelids get heavy along with your child's!Our highest recommendation!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I would never admit it, but Good Night Moon is still my favorite story. I have read thousands of books over the years, and Good Night Moon is the most perfect. It is the closest you will come to reading your child a lullaby - the perfect solution if you cannot sing!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"The Goodnight Moon Cloth Book Box is pretty and pleasant to the touch, but reducing the pages from one for each \\"Goodnight\\" to a mere six loses the effect given by the changing light in the room, as we (hopefully!) get closer to sleep. I wish this had been made clear in the advertisement. I was very disappointed."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I was disappointed in the number of pages and the limited reading material in the book. Should have ordered a different version without the cloth box, which is really useless."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I've read both the negative and positive reviews about this book. For those who do not like this book, I understand why because I too did not like it at first. I received it as a baby shower gift, and wasn't sure why the person who gave it to me raved about it so much. I thought the illustration is, for lack of a better word, \\"ugly\\". I also didn't like the black and white pages in between. When I first read it to my 3 month old daughter, I thought the book sounded so odd, and the wording did not make any sense. I put the book away, thinking perhaps my daughter will enjoy it at a later age.When she was 11 months, I gave the book another try. To my surprise, she paid attention and sat very still on my lap. I started reading it to her every night after that. The more I read it, the more I learn how to read it \\"creatively\\". I read the book to her with different tones and at different paces, switching between slow and fast and soft and animated depending on the line. She is now almost 1 years old, and she's starting to reach out to touch the different objects in the book. Sometimes when she's fussy, I'll just recite the first couple of pages from memmory and she'll immediately SMILE!Overall, I wouldn't recommend the book for a small baby. Also, the book takes a little getting used to, but once you get the hang of it, it becomes magical."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"A classic book for kids. I had a program at work where we read this book to the children before their bedtime. I needed multiple copies."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I purchased this book for my 3 year old great granddaughter. Kaydencce Le-ann loves it and we have read it over and over...first I read it to her and then she \\"reads\\" it back to me. The words and illustrations are great for her age group. I would recommend this book to anyone with young children."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"When my husband picked out this book for our 14 month old daughter recently, I thought to myself; yikes this book is pretty dull for a active little girl like ours that is always grabbing for the shiniest prettiest things. I wondered if she would like it as much as the colorful counting book I had chosen. Since the very first time I showed it to her she loved it and daily brings it to me to sit and look at or let me read to her, unlike the colorful counting book that usually lies on the floor as a rug mat or a 2 second look at book. She somehow finds Goodnight Moon soothing and comforting and when all fails to calm her for nap time or bed this book does. She even looks at the black and white pages and points at items. She loves this book and truly I think it is a charmer. I even find myself thinking the lines in my head, they are contagious! Worth every penny!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This is a replacement book for my granddaughters. It's a wonderful story for children, and my granddaughters love it as much as my own children!HIGHLY recommended."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"The Bible...Foxe's Book of Martyrs...and Goodnight Moon? This is one of my all time favorites. A generational classic!!! As a kid I was convinced the images were glowing, that's how contrasted the light from dark is once the bunny starts saying goodnight to objects. All illustrators can look up to this book and writers too.The board book is a nice size for little hands to help flip the pages too. My four month can do it - the perfect size! It's nice to have a bedtime book. All our other books are great too...but when the littlest of ones see \\"Goodnight Moon\\" come out they know its time to dream!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"The goodnight moon bunny has been an important part of our family for 19 years. My daughter was given the board book and bunny when I was still pregnant and bunny has not been put aside since. Bunny has traveled the world with Sam, has attended weddings, camping trips, and a variety of family functions. He's off to college with Sam next week. My sister is about to have her first baby. I purchased the goodnight moon set for our addition to the family. I suspect this buuny will be loved like ours has been. Fast delivery and in perfect condition. The only negative is the manufacturer must be making the bunny a little bit smaller than the orginial (of 19 years ago)... Still a GREAT gift. Thanks!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"My daughter is almost 8 but special needs and she has loved this book since I first read it to her as a baby. It is her absolute favorite. Even now she loves it and so does my 3 year old. I'm not sure what it is about the story and pictures but it has always been their favorite and is perfect for bedtime. I have read it so many times I know it by heart now. Most kids that I know have this book and have liked it, including mine so I highly recommend it.I only wish they would put it on kindle (I read on the iPad so it'd still be in color) because I have been through so many copies of this book over the years and it gets expensive to keep buying it over and over. Plus I'd like to have it so I can take it with me wherever and it wont get lost because the kids like to drag the book around lose it and then beg me to read it to them."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"When I was a kid I used to love this book, and my mom would read it to me every night. Now being older, I don't read it (as often) but I still very much like this this book. I highly recommend that you read this book to your kids or babies as it is a soothing bedtime classic.Oh- and by the way, your kids will probably get a laugh out of \\"Goodnight Nobody\\",just like many people who have read this book!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Loved the board book and the bunny is my daughter's favorite new lovey. She hangs on to that bunny and falls alseep with it. She's only 4 months old, so I can't wait for her to understand that's the same bunny in her book."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"How does one review a classic such as \\"Goodnight Moon\\"? No child's library should be without it. Just buy it."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I love this book. It was given to me years ago when I had my first child. Each of my kids have enjoyed the book and have found great interactive fun in searching for the mouse on each colored page. It's one of my favorite board books in our library."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Obviously this is a great book, but this version just gives it an extra dimension. Kids get even more out of an experience if there are extra senses involved, and the tactile feel of this book is wonderful. Expect them to use it as a pillow. :)"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"If you grew up with Goodnight Moon you'll love this, if you didn't you wont understand what all the excitement is about. It's a nice story, my husband loves it, I'm ok with it."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This is a lovely little book that has withstood the test of time. It's pace is soothing and unhurried, its graphics familiar and universal in appeal. In short, it's the perfect read-me-a-story-before-I-go-to-bed book.I like that the vocabulary is limited, that the author uses rhyme effectively, and that picture clues help little ones with word recognition. My copy is a board book that can hold up to the sometimes ungentle handling by by book loving grandson.There are numerous parodies of this book; Goodnight Bush is particularly funny. To appreciate the humor of the parodies, it is important to read the original GoodNight Moon first."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I was very happy to get this book because read it to my grandchildren and now I plan on reading it to my great grandchildren."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"i love this book and it is a cloth book great for a two year old and a christmas gift."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"My toddler loves this book.

I had lost our first Goodnight Moon book so this was the second one I ordered."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I had lots of memories with this book with my mom as a little girl. Excited to share similar memories with my little girl now too :)"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This book is so beautifully done. It's so simple to read with simple soft soothing pictures to look at. I think the pictures pull you into the that world. It's also a soothing soft read too. The words put you into a quite calm mood. I have read this to my children every night and it was a book I enjoyed as much as the kids, so I didn't mind reading every night. My daughter requested it for her daughter, which is why I just bought it again. Sometimes less is more, and this is certainly true this with book. A must if you have children around."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This is a children's classic that every household should own. It's a wonderful, imaginative book that kids of all ages enjoy."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I don't really think the description of this item is clear enough, yes it says big book, but I thought that meant the regular size hardbook style book, not a HUGE, oversized floppy book. I do not like it and I can't stand that I have to pay Amazon to ship it back. They should have free returns!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This is a wonderful and inspiring bedtime story!

When he grows out of it, I plan to pack it away in his baby stuff. It's a timeless classic that will ALWAYS take me back to his early years. I love it!!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I bought this paperback book together with several other board books when my baby was 9 months old. She was not interested in this book at all and did not touch it for a long time. She typically fell asleep shortly after a bath and a bottle feed, therefore, I didn't bother to read to her as a bedtime routine. At 14 months old, she would toss and turn for a while before she fell asleep. Now at 15 months, she refuses to go to bed in the evening. That is when I started to read this book to her and it works like a charm. If she is ready for bed, half way through the book, she would yawn and fall to the bed from my arms. With thumb in her mouth, she falls asleep in a minute. Tonight, she cried when I took her to her bedroom, she wanted to play, refusing to go to bed. So I decided to read her this book, twice. Before I finished the second round, she couldn't keep her eyes open. I let her lie down, she didn't even move a bit, fell asleep right away. I don't know exactly how this book works, but it works. Since we don't speak to her in English, I had to translate the poem into our native language. The color of the room is getting darker and darker as the story progresses, that probably play some role in preparing babies for bed. Other factors including: saying goodnight to familiar objects, seeing that everyone is sleeping (the bunny, the cat...), switching from color to white and black...>>>>>>>>>>>>>>update, after a while she figured out that we read this book to make her fall sleep and she refuses the book :("},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I have to admit, the first time I read this to one of my children, I was shocked at how little was in the book. My child ask for this book almost every night. It is something about it, that really gravitates children's interest.

He will reach for it in his book basket."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"My son got so excited as soon as he saw the goodnight moon box,this is gonna be his 2nd goodnight moon book..he have his 1st one for a year and he kinda messed it up,so i went got him new one he was so happy,but hes not into the bunny thing i think its too small.oh he love the goodnight moon so much...."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I've read this book many, many times while babysitting my young cousins. And now with twin nephews I'm sure I'll read it even more. It's a delightful book that I enjoy reading as much as the children enjoy hearing it. And the text is short enough that even an active child can sit through it. A definite must for any new mom! Makes a wonderful shower gift too."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"When we had a baby, one of the first things we knew we needed to get was a copy of Goodnight Moon. I remembered it from my own childhood, and we'vc given it as a birthday gift more than once. Sure enough, our daughter loves it; we're on our second copy since the original hardback we got has been read to death. It was one of the first bedtime stories we read to her, and she still picks it from her shelf at night."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I have read this book to my daughter since she was only a couple weeks old (she's now 17 mos). It is a very easy to read book that we really enjoy to sit together and look at. Leads perfectly into time for bed.

He is two years old now, has memorized it, and reads it to me every night before bed. I wish there were more books like this one!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"The lyrical text of &quot;Goodnight Moon&quot; has made it a beloved favorite with my two girls. The simple, colorful illustrations are enchanting and even though I know the entire book by heart, I love sharing it again and again with my children.This is my standard baby gift -- I believe no child should have to go to sleep without hearing the words &quot;in the great green room...&quot;"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"My 9 month old son does not sit still. When he crawls to his books (around 15 board books) he always picks out Goodnight Moon. The simple words and different voices make this books a delight to read.

This book fits into a successful bedtime routine very well. You'll love this book."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This book tells of a bunny saying goodnight to all the things around him before he sleeps. The simple manner by which the story is told really catches my daughter's attention that it becomes easy for her to memorize the book by heart.The illustrations are cute (especially the mouse --- seen in almost every page!) and the voices behind the songs (audio cassette) make my baby fall asleep faster!A truly delightful book for babies and moms!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"My sister had kids before me and always mentioned Goodnight Moon. Of course, I ignored her. Now being a mother of two, I can't stop singing the praises of this book. From the time by daughters were about 6 months old they loved this book. The way your voice sounds with the cadence of the story. I buy it for all my friends who are having kids. It's a must for every mother."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I have my copy of this book since I was a baby when my father read my brother and me to sleep. It is worn down and old, some of the pages are torn, the corners frayed with age...and yet, it is a token of my childhood that I will never give up. This is a must have for any child and parent...it is a memory that will last forever...it is the bedtime story you will memorize from the day you are brought home until the day your grandchild reads it to you."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I bought this book as a special present for my son for his first Christmas, and I was very happy I did. My son enjoys hearing this book read to him before he goes to bed, and the words always seem to calm him more than any other book he reads. Even when he is boisterous, this book lulls him, and I begin to hear his breathing steady as I proceed through the book. This book has also served us well for a long time because there is a lot to look at in the pictures and a changing story in the illustrations that isn't necessarily reflected in the narrative, so he finds something new to look at and comment upon each time we read the book. Because there are not a lot of words per page, the pages go quickly, so a toddler isn't likely to get impatient, and the repetition of the phrases is very soothing.I read an article where a mother used Goodnight Moon to teach her son to say good night to all the things around him, which gave them an excellent routine for getting him to go to bed easily. They would say good night to the moon outside, and then his toys, his clothes, and the light as it was turned off."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"The little ones seem to love the simplicity and bright colors. It winds them down for bed as they watch the progression of the bunny and the dimming of the illustrations. I've always loved the quiet comfort of the last page."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Read this to your young children. It's an absolutely perfectly simple book. No extra fluff....just a great read for you and your children. I read this every night to my daughter with hush little baby. She has grown to love the moon and is sparked with excitement for nighttime viewings of stars and the moon. Education starts early. Reading is SO important. Take advantage of this classic read. They will remember it for years."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This is such a beautiful and reassuring book to read to a child. Everything is in it's place and it will be just the same when the bunny wakes up in the morning. \\"Goodnight Moon\\" was given to us when my son was born, along with \\"The Runaway Bunny,\\" another highly-recommended classic by the same team. We read this together for years at tuck-in time and had two copies--a hardback for home and a paperback for travelling. Even today, the book lingers in the memory."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Not only is it a great \\"story\\", a nice poem, bedtime-related, and child-friendly, with great illustrations. The cadence and flow of it are purrrrfect for putting (and slowing) a little one down. It starts offbeat, falls into a sing-songy pattern, and the breaks out as the first half ends: \\"a comb and a brush and a bowl full of mush, and a quiet old lady whispering hush\\". Gorgeous, and works wonders! Every house with a child needs two copies - and every house without a child needs at least one."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I first read this book before I knew what words were. Well, I was read the book by my parents. I'm now 23 years old and still love it! It became a family keepsake over the years. I've read it to children I've babysat and to my parents when I come home to visit. I loved looking at the pages, trying to find the mouse. Its easy to read and symbolic in a sense. It's especially great to read to young children before bed, its calming and relaxing! I would definitely recommend this book to ANY parents, young or old, who would like to give their child a gift of a lifetime!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This is the last book I read my daughter every night before she goes to sleep. She's 5 months old but has loved this book (or tolerated it) since she was 3 months old. Now it's part of the routine. It's a great book -- now I know why so many parents have this book!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This book was one of our bedtime rituals. When I was weaning my son from frequent night-time breastfeedings, we would read this book at bedtime every evening. Sometimes I could hear him \\"reading\\" this book to himself in the dark if he was still have trouble settling down. Often, we read it in unison, and chuckled together. It's sweet and slow and comforting, and simply taking the time to cuddle and read it has a peaceful effect on both parent and child."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"My 21 mo old daughter loves the original \\"Goodnight Moon\\" and loves to play with the little acessories and popout features in this book. The story is the same and there is \\"lots to do\\" while turning the pages."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Having heard lots of parents mention this book as the gold standard in bedtime reading, we purchased it for my 18 month old. She is a tough cookie to get to sleep, but we have now found a way that works every time. She absolutely LOVES this book, she picks it out each night before we get her p.j.'s on and tuck her in, then we read it together (three or four times!) before she gets droopy-eyed and yawns herself to sleep. I even find myself getting mesmerized by the repetition of verse and pictures on the colorful (yet easy on the eye) pages. The story is simple, the characters few, but my daughter delights in picking out the tiny mouse on each page, in finding the red ballon, the clock, the kittens, mittens, and the bowl of mush. I recommend the Lap Edition since it is nice and large; our little one looks as though she can step right into the \\"big green room\\" as I read to her on each giant page. A must have for early childhood reading!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"My daughter Loves this...most this.

Then once you finally arrive home you feel a sigh of relief. This book seems to give children that type of comfort and feeling every time they hear it. They love the pictures and never seem to tire of the story. It's such a simple book but kids love it and that's what matters."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Our son loved this book. It was probably his longest running favorite book to be read at bedtime. He loves to read books and this was one of his favs."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Just like many other children, my boys love reading Goodnight Moon before bedtime. Our first copy was destroyed when my 2,5-year-old didn't enjoy his newborn brother's presence. Tough times... We ordered a second copy, now reading to both 15mo and 3,5yo. It's short enough that my 15yo can keep focused.Even though it lacks emotion, somehow my 3,5-year-old chooses Goodnight Moon over Guess How Much I Love You. He's a very sensitive and emotional boy, so I thought he would prefer a book that talked about emotions. Not sure what the magic is for my little one, but whatever it is, Goodnight Moon's got it."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"No children's library is complete without this book and my baby girl reads it almost nightly!!! She loves it and has made me a proud mommy :)"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Goodnight Moon was my son's favorite book when he was small. I must have read it to him thousands of times. I chose this version to give as gifts for baby showers. I know my son would have LOVED having the bunny to cuddle as we read the book together."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"My now 2-year old son asks for us to read this to him over and over each night - he just loves it. We both enjoy it too, but really can't tell you why it seems to have any almost mythic hold on so many young children. The text is simple, but it is visually full of small details that our son likes to point out, which must be part of it. This book is like Goodnight, Gorilla - a wildly popular and sweet book that is sort of hard to explain the allure of."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This is a cute bedtime book. It is sturdy and great for little hands. My daughter points to the things in the room. I love the great details and the comfort the text provides to little ones."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Book Review by Michael J. Green \\"The Word Man\\"In browsing the family bookcase today, I came across this jewel that I memorized many years ago as a first time parent. Wow what memories \\"Goodnight Moon\\" brought back. To see my precious first daughter and later her younger sister slowly slip into a state of rest while the inventory of items in \\"The Great Green Room\\" passed through their imaginations like we have been taught sheep are supposed to do. Well counting sheep has never worked for me. However, I can't begin to total the number of nights that I fell asleep at my daughter's side as the \\"Great Green Room\\" danced across our imaginations simultaneously. This is a wonderful bedtime story that brings parents and their young children closer together. Even after so many years have passed, it still brings smiles to our faces as we begin dreaming about reading the same book to our grandchildren.In spite of being \\"light reading\\", the bright illustrations that accompany each pages exciting entr&eacute;e make this book a must for helping kids to learn to identify everyday items that they see in their bedrooms and around the house. The associations made between the words and the illustrations are exciting, yet comforting as your baby's eyes gently close to enter them into a state of rest and preparation for another successful day ahead. My wife and I started reading this book to our babies as newborns, and they never lost interest until they outgrew bedtime stories completely. This was always the requested \\"last book of the day\\" and snoring could always be heard before the book closed (Sometimes it was me!)."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This was my daughter's favorite story as a toddler and I couldn't resist giving it to her, with bunny, at her first baby shower!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"My 16 month old just loves this book. It's a must read every night. He has learned to say cow and kitty from seeing them in this book. I don't know what it is about this book but kids are drawn to it."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Although I personally did not grow up with this book in my library, I've enjoyed getting to know it with my son. As soon as we started reading this book together, it became one of his favorites. The bright colors and the variety of items to pick out and name make it entertaining. I am curious to see if others have run into the same thing: my son likes balloons a lot, so the \\"red balloon\\" was definitely a focus point. At 17 months old, he was pointing out the inconsistencies- from one picture to the next, the red balloon and its string will disappear and then reappear. My son will point to where the balloon is and then where the balloon should be on another page. Has anyone else run into this? I'm curious why the author created such inconsistencies (unrealistic for a balloon, ok for a moving mouse)- were these just errors that happened upon publishing that were never corrected? Nevertheless, we still enjoy the book (glad to see his eye for detail) and recommend it."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"i had written a scathing review of Goodnight Moon, after i read the boardbook version at my niece's house. it really did not flow, and made no sense. i was so disappointed because i had heard so many good things about the book, and i love Margaret Wise Brown's other books. i decided to finally give it another chance when i found the Lap Edition in our library. it is wonderful! there was also a copy of the smaller boardbook so that i could compare and make sure i was not crazy! there are a few differences, but they make the difference to THIS reader. we bought a copy for our home, and it is our favorite book to read. and we do read it over and over. my daughter loves to point out the red balloon and the kittens."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I still remember the feeling I had the first time I read this book to my daughter. She was 2 1/2 at the time. Captivated and excited, she wanted to read it over and over again. There is something about this book that keeps kids interested. I didn't see what the big deal was about the book, which is why I waited till she was over 2 before finally buying the book. I should have bought it sooner."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This is a must for any children's library. A great story to read to a child."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Goodnight Moon is a childrens classic. My son loves reading this book every night. Book was in good condition."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I purchased this book for my little daughter as a bedtime story. It is a board book, and thus very sturdy, and perfect for the wear and tear of a child. The illustrations are cute, and the story is very easy for a little one to follow. The repetition would be good for helping a child to learn to read on their own, and seems to lull a child into sleep. All in all, the book is a classic for a reason, and I would purchase it again."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This book will always be one of the very best bed time books for young children.

I would say best for ages 6-18 months. Great book!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"We have read this book through four children, and are starting on the first grandchild.I still haven't figured out why children stick to this story like glue, but even I never get tired of it, and believe me, I have read it over and over and over and over again.Relax and read this aloud with a gentle rhythm, slowing down to match the pace of pre-bedtime relaxation. The rhymes are pleasant without being too obvious, and the subtle changes in the illustrated rooms are fun to look for -- specifically, where's the mouse?The Toddler has already misplaced one copy, just from dragging it around throughout the house. Time to get another one."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"For anyone who has children under 5 years of age. Can you think of a better book to read to little children just before bed than a book about the moon? Just thinking about the moon makes me sleepy! It is great fun for kids to find the little mouse on each page. Buy this classic book for your child or grandchild-you will not be sorry!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"The first time I read this book to my child, I got it out at the library. I thought it was silly and didn't make a lot of sense to me. The book stayed on my mind for weeks after though, and grew on me. I think it creates a comforting enviroment for the child and it is a great book to read to them before bedtime. What I would like to know is why is the \\"quiet old lady\\" not called \\"Grandmother\\" to the rabbit who is ready to go to sleep? I wonder if this \\"old lady\\" adopted the child, and where are the child's parents? This made me feel like the rabbit was lucky to have such a nice \\"old lady\\" to take care of him and knit by his bedside. Why was the bowl of mush uneaten, and isn't mush for breakfast? It is also funny how the kittens take not notice of the mouse in the same room as them. There are small,hidden, interesting things in this book, the answers to these questions we will probably never know. I gave this book five stars because it gives the reader a lot to think about, like those questions above, and especially because the book creates that great before bedtime setting. All of Margaret Wise Brown's books seem to create an aura of comfort, and they are timeless classics."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"we just loved reading this book to our 3 daughters and now we gift it to anyone having a baby..."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"As a children's book author and mom I admire the writings of Margaret Wise Brown for years.

We had to read Goodnight moon each night. Both my girls loved looking at all the little details in the pictures and finding and saying goodnight to all characters and objects in the book.

It's not too long that it gets exhausting and the kids look forward to hearing it. It has very familiar rhymes and illustrations. I have gone through many copies of Goodnight Moon with my four children. They love to finish the sentences and point out the telephone and the stars and other things not mentioned in the text. They love the sounds of the words. It's often a child's first introduction to the cadence of poetry.I frequently buy this as a gift for a new baby. I recommend buying it as a board book as it will last longer.

The book I received was just as described and I received it in a timely maner."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Goodnight Moon was a favorite in our house for many years.

It's always a hit!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"My almost 2 year old loves this book. Personally I really struggled with ever wanting to read this book since it seemed so boring, but its a great first book for the little ones. THey pick up on something different each time. This has been one of our night time favorites and I can see why people love it so much. It took till he was about 15 months before he liked this story, but it is perfect for a kid as early as a year."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I know that this is a popular book, but I was not expecting my son to love it as much as he does. As soon as I incorporated this book into bedtime, all other books sit on the shelf. He usually has me read this story to him 3 or 4 times. And he is trying to say the words with me. Great book and it makes my almost 2 year old smile every time."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Upon receiving this book I initially wrote a bad review of it, as the illustrations have a lot to be desired, but after reading it to my son I think it's only fair that I change my feedback.

It helped them to get used to the idea that it was bedtime and time to settle down for the night. Being able to point to the objects in the book as we are reading helped them to build their vocabulary of common items in the house. I recommend this wonderful book for all parents with babies."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This book rocked my world. I laughed, I cried, It moved me. A true classic.

It goes without saying that the book is a surefire hit with little ones, but I wasn't sure how the nightlight would be received. My girls ended up fighting over it because it was so appealing! Nightlight could be a little brighter, although I guess that's not exactly the point...I can't imagine anyone being disappointed by this set."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I have to say I never thought I would love this book. If I were to rate it just as an adult, I would give it like 3 stars. Having read it to my kids, I have to say this is their favorite book. Margaret Wise Brown obviously knew something about kids I didn't know. I can't believe she never had children yet she understood them so well. I love the cardboard lap edition so the kids don't have to fight to see and the words are nice and big. The kids are paying more attention to the words. The letters stand out more in the bigger print. It is built to endure too. It is a beautiful book."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"It was given as a baby shower gift along with other things and my niece was thrilled to get this book for her first child. She had read this book to her sister's children at least a hundred times or more."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Don't know what the special quality is in this simple little book about going to bed, but it is one of the sweetest and most precious memories of my kids' childhood. Each night from infancy to toddlerhood I would read it to them while rocking them to sleep. They would first start pointing to items and then, as they could talk, would softly say \\"Goodnight\\" to the characters as I read. It has a definitively calming effect. I just purchased a copy for my first granddaughter!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I am actually surprised that my son loves this book so much. I bought it because it is one of \\"the classics\\" and a must have for every young child's collection. But I figured that the black and white alternate pages and the old style pictures wouldn't interest him after all of his new fancy brightly coloured books. I am happy to report that I couldn't have been more wrong. He LOVES this book. It is an every day read and upon reaching the end, is usually requested again. He is 17 months old at present and hasn't even begun to tire of Goodnight Moon. I highly recommend this book for the little set. There's just something about it that captures their imagination."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I read to my daughter regularly, and without a doubt this is her favorite book.

This book is a classic, and I'm sure it will be a staple in my home for a long time."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I got this book because of the rave reviews. When I read this to my 1st child and I think he was about 18 months old at the time, he was scared looking at the pictures. The sleepy 'rabbit' looked so small in the huge room and there where shadows everywhere.My child could be very sensitive because he was scared when I read 'Cat in the Hat' because the story is about a stranger in the house with the kids! I think at that time, he was between 1 to 2 years old."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I never even heard of this book until about 10 years ago, when suddenly it appeared on every \\"must read\\" list going. I like children's stories, even those most would deem boring, but this has got to be one of the most BORING books ever written, and the muted black and white illistrations just make it worse! My two boys like everything, including technical books and three word baby books, but THEY HATE THIS BOOK! They beg me NOT to read it to them."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I used to be a fan of this \\"Story\\" when I was a child. I am glad to say that after reading this over again while holding an English degree, I will no longer be buying or reading the \\"Goodnight Moon\\" series, and I definitely never read the sequel \\"Good Morning Sun\\" There are many things wrong with this book. Goodnight lacks a proper subject and predicate agreement, which is needed for the early development of a kid. Without this book teaching him what a subject or a predicate is, who will? Not our teachers, that's for sure. In a recent study and survey done with CNN, teachers are opting to \\"completely obliterate\\" the need for teaching what a subject and predicate are, which rightfully should be taught by the books we read our children. The opinions in this book are just as cockamamie!I am never again reading my child something as idiotic as a unnameable person being told \\"Goodnight stars Goodnight air\\". The stars can not sleep (due to the fact they are just gaseous balls of elements)! The air cannot hear you talking-the air is what helps you talk! it has no way of hearing your message! My child, Moneer, called me up during his second-lunch and said \\"Father, why don't the stars ever say 'goodnight' back to me?\\" Know what I had to say? The stars aren't ever gonna say goodnight, Moneer. Most of them are actually dead. Just like your father when the time comes.\\" This book was also the reason why I had to tell my son about the world and the universe and where his dog actually went, instead of \\"the farm up at grandma Georgia's\\". For those who decided not to read my whole review, please take this out of the whole thing: This book is not worth the trouble it will start. Next time I'm just gonna have him watch \\"Pawn Stars\\"."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This book, though highly regarded, sets the stage for something awful in childhood development. It teaches children to anthropomorphise (and on top of that show respect to!) all sorts of random aspects of creation. I didn't climb to the top of the food chain to have my child concern himself with pleasantries to objects. The room serves us, not the other way around! It should thank us for building it and giving it a purpose, not expect us to wish it well at night. It's this type of nonsense that will have my child on the dole after dropping out of high school."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"We got this book as a gift at my baby shower. Having heard so many great things about this \\"classic,\\" I was expecting a wonderful children's book. Maybe these high expectations were part of the problem, but I was extremely disappointed. I just don't see what the fuss is about-- just because something has a reputation for being a classic, doesn't mean it's good. The story is not interesting at all, but worse, the illustations are completely unengaging. I do not like that some of the pictures are really tiny, and the fact that every other page is in black and white seems unfitting for a children's book. My daughter is only 6 months old so I don't know her opinion of this book yet, but I can't get myself to read it to her. My mother-in-law can't understand how I don't consider this book to be a wonderful classic, but I think she's just being sentimental since she read it to her kids and can't see beyond this."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I would never dare to say any of this if I were running for office, but .....I was given Goodnight Moon by a well-meaning enthusiast who felt I could be no parent or claim to know children's literature unless I owned the book. Sure, Goodnight Moon is popular; it's had staying power. But the same could be said for pork rinds and \\"The Dukes of Hazzard.\\" Goodnight Moon is a tired catalogue of meaningless objects, to each one of which I used to say \\"goodnight\\" three or four times a week. My kid has it memorized, but she can also recognize a Home Depot sign, so that's a wash. Moreover, the shrilly colored, crudely drawn, flatly artless illustrations irritate my eyes. My daughter and I have moved on to something else now--actual books."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"My daughter and I were not impressed with this book. The grey pages were boring and the figures too small. Saying goodnight to everything in the room can be done quite easily without this book."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"\\"Goodnight Moon\\" is the classic, heartwrenching tale that combines a suspenseful plot with a heartwrenching portrait of the frailty of human nature. It's right up there with \\"Go Dog Go.\\"I will warn you that this novel, though brilliant, is not for the faint-of-heart. If your toddler can't take a little GORE or SEXUALITY, you should definitely stay away from this one, and stick to the books intended for the kiddies who aren't yet such great listeners--I recommend \\"The Complete Kama Sutra.\\" This one is worth your money; buy it! You've got to experience this for yourself and see why this disgustingly blasphemous account was banned in 46 states."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"On the surface, it's a nice book. There's a calming rhythm to the way the objects in the room are introduced and then said \\"goodnight\\" to.However, the colors are anything but calming. The red and green color scheme makes me uneasy; if you like Christopher Alexander or the Montessori theories of surrounding children with beautiful things, you might not like it either.And secondly, if you want to bring up your children to love God or at least acknowledge the existence of things that are not part of the physical world, things such as love, spirituality, truth, etc., I think you'll find the page which says \\"goodnight nobody\\" a bit jarring. The message I take away from the book is that there's nothing outside of the physical world (the \\"room\\" and the moon), nothing and nobody whom we can't see or touch. You may think I'm going overboard, but for most people, bedtime has some spiritual associations, whether you want to pray to God or just take a few deep breaths and be at peace with the universe. I think \\"goodnight nobody\\" is a rebellion against these activities."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"The book goodnight moon was my husbands favorite childhood memory of his mother reading to him nightly. He had memorized all the words and when he was given this book as a kind memory to cherish, the very last page was missing. He was so disappointed and I was very upset that his surprise was incomplete."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I would definitely pass this book up. The picture on each page is nearly exactly the same as the picture on every other page - and they are all boring. The words are completely uninteresting. One advantage to this book, is that it does put you and your baby to sleep. My one year old and I enjoy many, many books together (her favorite is The Very Quiet Cricket), but this is not one that she enjoys at all."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I don't see why all these people have rated this as such a great book. There are so many other really great books. I got 5 copies for baby presents.

And he probably has 100 others that he loves."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I am soooo disappointed with this book. After reading all the glowing reviews, I expected more. The story is boring. It just points out various things in a room, then proceeds to say \\"good night\\" to all the objects in the room. The illustrations not impressive, and every 2 pages alternate between black/white and color. I've been reading this to my daughter since she was very young (now 14 months old), but she's never really been that interested in it."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Me, my husband and my young son all have no use for this book. The words and pictures do not hold my son's attention. He's clever enough to need more than just repetition to engage him. My husband finds the colors of the illustrations (the half that have color, anyway) to be jarring, and while the colors don't bother me I think the drawings are rather ordinary. Worst of all, I find it creepy that the rabbits own a cat. My family said goodbye to \\"Goodnight, Moon\\" after a few readings."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I bought this due to all the raving reviews. My daughter loves to be read to. She has a great attention span for a 18-month old. She would sit through 4 to 5 Dr Seuss' books (The Cat in the Hat, Green Eggs and Ham, etc) in one reading session. When I read Goodnight Moon to her the first time, she didn't let me finish, closed the book herself and tossed it. Every time I tried to read this to her, she said &quot;No!&quot; I'd say this book is not a keeper. I don't even like it myself! Is there a way to rate something no even a star?"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I am sorry, I can not give this book a good review. It is just very boring. We ordered this because it has so many good reviews and when we received it and read it, I am afraid we were left scratching our heads as to why all the good reviews????? There are so many other entertaining books out there, with much better illustrations for the very young..........don't spend your money on this one, it's is NOT worth it!"},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"This book is not visually stimulating nor is there any real prose.

So disappointing after reading all the good reviews...if you really must throw away your money, send it my way."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I feel a little silly to be about the only one who doesn't get this book's appeal. It shows the same pictures over and over again, and every other page is black and white. No appeal whatsoever to my daughter, now age 18 months, who has had this book since birth. People say it's the 'lulling&quot; repeatability of the goodnight theme... I say, it's boring. There are so many bright, lively, board books out there today. I do not recommend this one, classic or not."},{"Title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"Ours is so worn, we need a new one.

There must be some magic incantation hidden in the off-rhymes and oddly shifting pictures!"},{"Title":"The Collapse of Soviet Military Power","review":"This book provides a useful study of how the Soviet military approached a future war with the U.S. Interesting details are provided about the Red Army's philosophies, obtained via author interviews.The book's conclusions are that the Soviets did not buy MAD theory, and actually believed a nuclear conflict could remain limited and end to the Soviets' advantage.Even more interesting are the insights into how and why the USSR collapsed in the political sense. Gorbachev's failures are convincingly presented as key, and overall the book is a good read."},{"Title":"Who's Who in Military History","review":"Whenever I am writing about the history of a lost ship I find myself drawn into the wider elements of the overall story. To give two examples; With many of the vessels I study having been victims of WW2, I have read the biography of Karl Doenitz and, having written a scuba diving guide to Malta, I also closely followed the involvement of Napoloen in 1798 and those of De La Valette - the eternal hero of Malta who died in 1568.Having, therefore, now discovered the existence of a single book containing the biographical details of, supposedly, all the prominent military figures from history (i.e. 1450 to the present day), I quickly settled down to read the accounts of several who came readily to my mind. I was left a little disappointed.My overriding concern was that De La Valette (after whom Valetta is named) is not included at all - and that omission suggests there will be other significant absentees. Another shortcoming is that the entry for the man who succeeded Hitler as Fuhrer and immediately sued for peace (Doenitz - architect of the U Boat war and a man, incidentally, I greatly admire) is so short as to contain nothing more than some brief notes which anyone might have conjured up from memory. Whereas others get far more coverage, there is clearly a lack of detail for far too many entries.Perhaps more importantly, I found the absence of the specific dates of birth and death of each subject covered to be a considerable failing. Yes, the years (e.g. 1861-1928) are included but this book is supposed to be far more detailed than that!Having said that, I write as someone who does not know which might be the next person from history to cross my desk and having a readily available source of collective biographies at best (or r&eacute;sum&eacute;s at least!) is most useful.NM"},{"Title":"Who's Who in Military History","review":"Who's Who in Military History is a useful reference work profiling over 500 key military leaders from 1453 to the 1970s. The date 1453 is used as the starting point as this is when the Age of Firearms began. Some biographical entries are longer than others. Includes 16 color plates, 300 black-and-white illustrations, nine pages of maps, and a glossary of military terms. This book is ideal for students and teachers of both world history and American history."},{"Title":"A Hell of a Woman","review":"Jim Thompson &amp; Larry Brown have at least one thing in common...happy endings and classic good guys are almost impossible to find in their books. In the hit or miss world of Jim Thompson novels this one certainly hits...hard! Hell Of A Woman is an ugly story that features characters with few, if any, redeeming qualities. This has surpassed The Killer Inside as my favorite Thompson novel. The suspense and surprise twists that books like The Alcoholics lack can be found here in spades. Thompson seems a little too at home in this setting of paranoia, sex &amp; crime. Its one shortcoming is typical of Thompson stories...it does occasionally come unwravelled, though not often enough to matter. I honestly didn't know how this one was going to turn out. You have the general idea of what's going down, but you can never be sure who's going to fall and who's going to get away with it. Thompson is a master of this hard-boiled genre and this is surely a highlight in an up and down career. Curl up around an ashtray and enjoy!"},{"Title":"A Hell of a Woman","review":"I'd heard high-praise for Mr. Thompson's books--from Stephen King to James Ellroy--but it wasn't until I read A Hell of a Woman that I became a believer. It's not only dark, like you'd expect, but alive! The book gets inside your head and won't leave, even after you've finished the last page. Images you will never shake! Read it!"},{"Title":"A Hell of a Woman","review":"Frank Dillon is working outside sales in the rain when a flash of lightening illuminates a woman in a window and thus begins one of Thompson's wildest novels.Dillon in A Hell of a Woman sees his whole life as having been squandered on one worthless woman after another, so much so that all women become a blur. But just as they are crowding into one person, Frank is turning into two; halfway through the book he creates a new persona, and by the end he's speaking out of both sides of his mouth.The text at the end splits into lines of alternating type one italic and the other regular print, so that we actually readtwo stories at once. One is a fantasty version of events and the other is what is really happening. I readthe last two pages seperating out the italics and the print and reading them seperately and I understood the ending better. Thompson has made a killer duet or killer in stereo with this novel and it is one wild ride."},{"Title":"A Hell of a Woman","review":"This novel deserves to be known as one of Thompson's best. Dolly Dillon may not appear to be as menacing as Lou Ford, but he is, if possible, more insane. Population 1280, Savage Night, The Nothing Man, After Dark, My Sweet, and The Killer Inside Me all feature 1st-person narrators with mental problems, but none of them have a problem like Dillon. Read to the end to see what I mean."},{"Title":"A Hell of a Woman","review":"This is not your average noir crime book. There are no detectives or mobsters just a small crime on the edges of society and how it can drive a man to madness. Jim Thompson is a dark master who plunges the depths of human darkness. Hell of a Woman shows the lengths to which one man will twist the truth in order to rationalize his own evil actions. If you love twisted crime books look this one up."},{"Title":"A Hell of a Woman","review":"This story might not be for everyone. It is very dark and disturbing. But, it will keep a reader's interest, I think.It is the story of a door to door salesman named Dillon, and how he gets involved with a troubled young woman with an evil aunt. The aunt has a BIG stash of money. One thing leads to another and several people, including the aunt and Dillon's wife, end up dead. Dillon's boss ends up arrested for a crime he did not commit, but there is poetic justice there. Dillon runs off with the young woman, but things turn out badly for her.The writing is very good - a reader can really feel like he/she is in the midst of the story. Very gritty, noire and all that. Some of the slang is a bit outdated and hard to follow - the book was written in the 1950's - but the context makes it understandable I thought. Dillon's mental state is \\"questionable\\" as the story progresses.In the original edition of the book, the last part was written as two columns side by side. One was the story as Dillon was seeing it, and the other was the story as actually happening. In this edition, they are mixed as alternating lines in regular type and italics in one column which makes things a little hard to follow. BUT, be patient and read slowly. The ending is rather shocking and surprising.Not recommended for the faint of heart as they used to say."},{"Title":"A Hell of a Woman","review":"Like so many other Jim Thompson novels, A Hell of a Woman dares to push the envelope as it not only defies convention but in fact shatters it. The story's narrator and protagonist (if that's the correct term) is an amoral sociopath with no redeeming qualities whatsoever, not one.Frank \\"Dolly\\" Dillon works in the unenviable world of door to door sales and collections. A world where he routinely chisels from others even as he himself is being chiseled. Of course, since Dolly is the sole narrator of this rather improbable tale, we have only his word as to the truth of his own victimization. And since Dolly freely and often changes the description of events depending on which version is most advantageous to him at any given moment, his word is worth very little.Conversational, folksy and informal, the narration itself provides a disturbing contrast to the shocking tale of greed, murder and endless duplicitity it describes. A Hell of a Woman is an excellent example of Thompson's use of unconventional storytelling as a means of revealing humanity's dark underbelly. Recommended to readers unafraid of catching a glimpse of the seamier side of life."},{"Title":"A Hell of a Woman","review":"I think this is one of Thompson's best books. He may use the basic Cain formula, but he takes us a lot further inside the mind of his narrator; in fact, a little too far for comfort."},{"Title":"A Hell of a Woman","review":"The story's narrator Dolly Dillon is so exquisitely creepy. A Hell of a Woman is the type of book that leaves you feeling a bit disturbed when you finish reading. A fabulous journey into the dark side of humanity. I can't wait to read another Jim Thompson novel."},{"Title":"A Hell of a Woman","review":"\\"A Hell of a Woman\\" is somewhat similar to another Jim Thompson classic, \\"The Killer Inside Me\\" in that it is a story of murder and mayhem told in the first person through the eyes of the killer. Like \\"Killer,\\" Frank Dillon, the protagonist here, has deep rooted issues involving women. In fact, the woman of the title could be any of several he describes, including his hell-on-wheels wife. The plot is right out of classic noir, as Dillon hatches an elaborate double murder scheme in order to make a huge score, win the girl he loves and escape his small town life and cruddy job as a salesman working for an abusive boss. Things go awry, as they usually do in these tales, and Dillon has to resort to further violence in a vain attempt to keep his plans from unravelling.The frank sexuality, gritty violence an unrepentant nature of the central character were probably quite a shock to readers when this book was first published in the early 1950s. It will, however, seem fairly tame to modern readers. A quick read at 185 pages, it is the novel equivilent of film noir from the era of its publication, and can be enjoyed the same way those films are today."},{"Title":"A Hell of a Woman","review":"'A Hell of a Woman\\" clearly falls right into Jim Thompson's turf: where a somewhat psychotic loser falls in love with Ms Wrong, then getting himself in deep trouble, and finally realizes that once again he hasn't moved forward in life at all (..but rather is worse off than when he started). Like is famous/notorious \\"The Killer Inside Me\\", Jim Thompson makes clever us of first-person narration including little slivers of where our 'loser' tells us his inner thoughts. Very chilling.Bottom line: good story, well-written, fine characterizations. No complaints."},{"Title":"A Hell of a Woman","review":"Great book by a gifted American noir writer...he understands the &#34;bad&#34; part of Man and delivers the goods through the evil mind."},{"Title":"A Hell of a Woman","review":"Jim Thompson is fast becoming my favorite writer.His books are unpretentious and move quickly withthat \\"hit the oxygen dialogue\\" of his.

As such, you, the lucky reader, are introduced to three women whose agendas and m.o.'s aren't what they seem (or are they?) at any given point in the narrative.

Great Writer.One of things I like about his books and others like them,that's they're are not so flipping long. Todays' books are 400-600 words are sometime just too long, too long to finish in a week-end or a week reading a few chapters a night 'fore bed. There are times I just don't to invest a month of my time reading a big thick book just to find it run out of steam 3/4 of the way through.Anyway these (Thomphson books) are perfect reading for a week-end or a short trip and surprise most are very good stories once you re-learn the some of the \\"old time\\" slang.

He drinks too hard and plays fast and loose with his company accounts. A parade of unsatisfactory women have passed through his life, all of them memorable only for the faults they displayed. And then Frank meets the beautiful Mona, a sexy young woman desperately in need of being rescued from the aunt who abuses her by trading Mona's favors rather than paying her bills.Frank is immediately entranced and thinks that Mona might finally be the woman he's waited for. He's even more excited to learn that he might not only have Mona but a huge pile of money as well. And all he has to do to get both the girl and the cash is kill a couple of people who desperately deserve killing.

He has a marriage he regrets, lives in a bad neighborhood, drives an older car (he stills owes money on), and has no future prospects.Then he stumbles into an opportunity. Ok, he may have to kill a few people, but it should be a big score. But things all go wrong. He has always been clumsy in his planning when doing anything shady, and a lot of things go awry - the story of his life.The story drifts at points between the real story, and the fantasy he lives in his mind.

Irigaray demonstrates how to dislodge, disrupt, and destabilize the barriers founded by certain academic standards. She dares to use words to describe the futility of words.&quot;...if your words have such seductive power, such a potent charge of investment, is it not because they come to fill the place of a desire deprived of words? Borrowing their strength from energy free from any declaration. A fundamental misunderstanding lies within your language: what it carries of persuasive power does not belong to speech but to what it covers in silence.&quot;(36)Another way Irigaray problematizes the othering of the spirit world is through exploding linear, normative conceptions of time and space in her reconstruction of infinity. She speaks of the current model of time as something which holds power by relying on a timeless void as its opposite. She defies this dualistic construction, describing not an abyss which relies on fullness and definition, but a fullness so vast it has the capacity to lodge emptiness within it.&quot;That invisible presence bearing you, supporting you there where you set up an opposing illusion of indifference as limit to your own desire. As a stasis at each point, guarding against the risk of overflowing which would lead to your downfall. Your vanishing into the immense space where you place that void which maintains your coherence.&quot; (Passions, 20)This book is a delightful contrast to the cold, hard and cerebral discourse most noted for contemporary theories of psychology, philosophy, feminism, and politics!"},{"Title":"Puppy Lost in Lapland","review":"Sad,yes, but exciting and interesting and a story of courage.

If you're looking for ideas, this isn't a bad book, but its size is unwieldy, its photographs in many cases just clearly enlarged from photos provided by the builders or architects, and there are more than a few errors throughout the book. I'd check this one out from the library rather than buying it."},{"Title":"25 Houses Under 1500 Square Feet","review":"This book was quite dissapointing. My biggest complaint is the idea of what is a house. A few of the buildings where guest houses or studios, or vacation homes. The title makes me want to see houses that people actually live in, with all of their stuff!Also the breadth of style I find to be unnecesary. From log cabins, post victorian, modern...no matter who is reading the book, they will think that pages were wasted on the style they aren't interested in.Some other books I found much more enjoyable for $25XS : Big Ideas in Small Scale BuildingsSmall Houses : Contemporary Residential Architecture"},{"Title":"25 Houses Under 1500 Square Feet","review":"I'm glad that the book exists - if James Grayson Truelove hadn't bothered to slap together this flawed survey, you'd not get to see these houses in any detail. But I enjoyed \\"Gwathmey Siegel: Houses\\" more, and even preferred other JGT archi-photo books to this one. Only 4 houses (of 25) had enough drawings and varied enough photos to see and make sense of the whole. Plan drawings are present for most of the houses, which is a step up from photos-only glossy books. Alas, they're small & unlabeled. In addition to the swap mentioned by other reviewers, p.30 is missing all its plans (typo/print-o), and p.128 has the 2nd/3rd floor plans upside-down from the first floor. \\"How,\\" you might ask, \\"could this idiot reviewer possibly complain about so simple a transform, which he obviously ought to be able to figure out?\\" Therein lies the problem with this book: In fact, it *wasn't* obvious how the house was arranged, because the accompanying photos were not comprehensive, nor documentary! Such is the case for most of the structures in this book: either multiple photos show the same angle, or they only really document one room in an entire design. To be fair, perhaps I should have realized this from the product description: 25 houses in 181pp. means only 7 pp. each. But with such a low page count, \\"white-spacey\\" layout, and largish photos, duplication is inexcusable. (N.B. Of 25 houses, 21 are modern-style.

But this book had some disappointing quirks. By far the most glaring quirk: The floor plan of the Methow Cabin (page 160) was ALSO printed on page 102 as though it belonged to the Cavehill Residence! Don't they have layout editors to catch such mistakes? Hey guys, there's only 25 houses in this book. You'd think they could match the right plan to the appropriate house. Twenty-one of the 25 homes had accompanying floor plans. (I didn't count the plan that appeared twice). Call me picky, but why leave out four plans when you included the other 21? For consistency's sake--at least. A few blurry photos remind me that a 3 megapixel digital photo loses clarity when enlarged to more than a 5X7 print. Nonetheless, I did not send the quirky book back. My complaint in a nutshell: Trulove's publisher could spend more time up front getting the layout right before rushing to print! The mistakes are embarrassing and unprofessional."},{"Title":"25 Houses Under 1500 Square Feet","review":"I'm an architect and was very much looking forward to this book as I am a fervent believer that bigger is not better.

There are literally pages that are marked \\"lower floor plan\\" & \\"upper floor plan\\" which are blank.Secondly, the majority of these houses are architectural follies. They are not \\"houses\\" in the meaning that most of us mean when we say house.

We have an Indian wanted for a stabbing who turns up dead. Not just dead but in the wrong place. Not the wrong place but in a mysterious way. There is also a team of archeologists looking into which craft (they just may find it). One archeologist seems to be missing. A strange Navaho has his hat stolen but the silver hatband left. A woman is coming to visit her fianc&eacute; is in for an adventure she did not count on. From all of this Joe Leaphorn must make some sort of sense.It is the descriptiveness of Tony Hillerman that goes beyond the mystery to pant a picture of a different world that we get to glimpse in the process of reading.Read the book but the addition of the voice of George Guidall ads a dimension to the story by helping visualize the people and correcting pronunciation of certain words. I suggest you read the book and listen to the recorded version.------------------------------------------------------------Dance Hall of the DeadThe Fire God is missingTwelve-year-old Ernesto Cata (Zu&ntilde;i) is practicing to be the Fire God in a local ceremony. His best buddy George Bowlegs (Navaho) is a Zu&ntilde;i wana-be.Ernesto is missing and there is a pool of blood by his bike. The next day his buddy George runs off. It is up to Sgt. Joe Leaphorn to find the boys before anything happens to them (if it has not already.)As with most of Hillerman's novels, everyone has different agendas and stories that overlap. There are alleged stolen artifacts form and archeological dig, and possibly a drug interest. They may or may not interact. We also get a good dose of Zu&ntilde;i culture, and a feel that we are in the area.Hillerman is nice enough to leave sufficient clues to let you figure out the mystery before Leaphorn and you then get to watch as he finally comes around to your way of thinking.Another book by Hillerman \\"The Boy who Made Dragonfly\\" further describes the dance hall of the dead (Kothluwalawa.)Author's Note:\\"In this book, the setting is genuine. The village of Zu&ntilde;i and the landscape of the Zu&ntilde;i reservation are depicted to the best of my ability. The characters are purely fictional. The view the reader receives of the Sha'lak'o religion is as it might be seen by a Navajo with an interest in ethnology. It does not pretend to be more than that.\\"--------------------------------------------------------Listening WomanA great cliffhangerJoe Leaphorn can put the loose ends together even when no one else realizes there are loose ends. The story starts out with an old man being bludgeoned and later Leaphorn is intentionally almost rundown by a mysterious man in gold-rimed glasses. He tries to tie these together. Then he uses an old robbery as an excuse to get out of a Boy Scout commitment and track down the antagonist. Needles to say the story gets more convoluted for everyone but Leaphorn.This is an excellent story with the added plus of the description of the area and the Navaho that occupies this area. What seems at first to be over description later enhances the final scenes.Speaking about the location and Navaho, even the schools, this story is even more enjoyable if you read \\"Seldom Disappointed\\" first. Tony describes how he comes by the plot and the people. He even goes out to locations first as research.I have read the book but the addition of the voice of George Guidall adds a dimension to the story by helping visualize the people and correcting pronunciation of certain words. I suggest you read the book and listen to the recorded version."},{"Title":"Rabbit's Morning","review":"This is a nice little book with very nice artwork.

Where is his/her family? Why, at the end of the book. The story ends with bunny finally arriving home to his own family where they snuggle and take a siesta.The artwork is simple and bright and cheerful.

I had read one other ISKCON publication before: one titled 'The Science of Reincarnation' which left me somewhat underwhelmed, in particular about how misleading the title was. It was not without reservation that I picked up the present volume and glanced through the Introduction. It read:_\\"In the early 1970s, Srila decided to analyze Western philosophy in light of Vedic philosophy. In a series of tape-recorded conversations, his scholarly disciples Hayagriva Dasa and Syamasundara Dasa presented to Srila selections from teachings of prominent Western philosophers, from Socrates to Carl Jung, and Srila commented upon them.\\"_In what I have come to recognize as typical over promise, the publishers/editors calmly claim superiority over western process of inquiry, with the following words:\\"Western philosophy has relied on individual speculation, which involved taking evidence from our senses and evaluating it with our minds. But this method leaves us with a great deal of uncertainty. After all, our senses are imperfect, and our minds are subject to illusion, mistakes and the propensity to cheat, to pretend we know something when we really don't. ... The Vedic philosophers recognized that one who uses this method can never achieve certain knowledge, free from illusion and doubt, because of those pesky imperfect mind and senses. ... This (Vedic) knowledge originating from Krsna, has been passed down through a chain of spiritual masters since the beginning of time. There is no need to change it, there is no need to speculate about it. The duty of a spiritual master is simply to pass this knowledge on to his or her disciples, who in turn become spiritual masters and pass it on to a new generation of disciples. Because this knowledge is not the product of imperfect human minds and senses, it is beyond illusion and doubt\\"_Clearly Srila was not disturbed by the possibility that there could be a weak link or two in this chain of masters, one with the same imperfections he accuses others of. But let's give him some benefit of doubt here.Looking at the Contents, I found the chapters intimidatingly named after intellectual giants of the western hemisphere, Socrates, Plato, Augustine, St. Thomas Aquinas (the book skipped the 'St.' part, interestingly), Kierkegaard, Freud, Nietzsche, Sartre, Darwin... I had heard of all of these chaps, but with the single exception of Darwin, I could not recall what each one's contribution to mankind was. To sort of benchmark the book, I headed straight for the Darwin chapter.And it did not take long for me before I wished I had just skipped the book.Srila begins the chaper begins on a somewhat docile note by saying there is no such thing as chance. What Darwin calls random mutations, he says is really the will of God, the plan of the master brain that has it all worked out. \\"As soon as he says chance it means that he has no knowledge,\\" he says of Darwin and his followers. But then unfolds an argument utterly defying common sense and logic, an alarming rejection of material evidence and a deeply disturbing literal reading of vedic scriptures. Only a few direct quotes can do justice:&lt;quote>*Srila*: ...Similarly, we say that at the time the evolusionists say life began, there were human beings existing.*Disciple*: They cannot find any evidence of that... Surely if men were living millions of years ago, they would have left evidence, tangible evidence, behind them, I could see their remains*Srila*: So I say that in advanced human societies bodies are burned after death, cremated. So where does your excavator get his bones? ... But human beings are burned, and therefore they cannot find their bones.*Disciple*: I'm just saying that it appears, through layer after layer of deposits i the earth, that biological forms tend to progress from simple and primitive forms to more and more complex and specialized ones, until finally civilized man appears.*Srila*: But at the present moment both simple and complex forms are existing. One did not develop into the other. The Padma Purana says there are 8.4 million species of life, and the soul evolves through them. This evolutionary process we accept: the soul evolves from aquatics to plants, to insects, to birds, to animals, and then to human forms. But all these forms are already there. They do not change. One does not become extinct and another survive. All of them are existing simultaneously.*Disciple* : But Darwin says there are many species, like dinosaurs, thar are seen to be extinct.*Srila*: What has he seen? He is not so powerful tha the can see everywhere or everything. His power to see is limited, and by that limited power he cannot conclude that one species is extinct. That is not possible. No real scientist will accept that.&lt;end quote>And on it goes. I stopped reading the book after reading this one chapter. If this is the quaity of discourse, why waste more time on the book."},{"Title":"Beyond Illusion and Doubt : A Vedic View of Western Phiosophy Articles from Back to Godhead Magazine","review":"More Srila Prabhupada reprints from Godhead magazine, using loaded language to discredit ideas of some of the world's finest minds. He claims that he is in fact a perfect man in the chapter on Marx, and uses a totally flawed understanding of evolution to try to disprove Darwin's theory of evolution. Prabuhpada writes with an arrogant tone throughout, using nonsense examples of perfect Vedic knowledge and is condescending and ignorant in his approach to the work of others.Good if you want to study religious or cult propaganda, but otherwise a distorted and probably unhealthy discussion on Western philosophy by a man who insists you should be doing what he says."},{"Title":"Union Street And Blow Your House Down","review":"Pat Barker's _Union Street_ and _Blow Your House Down_ are hard-hitting, gritty novels about the lives of working-class women in northeast England (_Union Street_) and prostitutes living in fear of a serial prostitute murderer (_Blow Your House Down_). These novels are not for anyone already taking Prozac; _Union Street_ in particular is unrelentingly depressing, with rape, physical abuse, unwanted pregnancies, and other unpleasantness. Both novels contain scenes that are deeply, shockingly horrible.So why read these two novels? Barker skillfully makes the lives of these women come alive for the reader: the tedium of their jobs, all the sensory attributes of their homes, the nature of their relationships with their husbands, boyfriends, children, and women friends. She allows us to look in at defining moments in these women's lives: moments that shape their lives, moments where they are forced to make choices, moments where they come to terms with their circumstances.Neither of these novels are exactly what you'd call fun reads, but they are thought-provoking, absorbing, well-achieved, and memorable. I prefer _Blow Your House Down_ to _Union Street_, perhaps because it is a bit more unified. The accumulation of different horrible circumstances in _Union Street_ can be a bit overwhelming. Both books impress you with these women's ability to survive despite extraordinary hardships, but neither book ever waltzes into the potentially mawkish territory of triumph over circumstances. These women are survivors, not victors.Pat Barker is one of the greatest contemporary British writers. If you are a fan of her better-known later work, I recommend this volume."},{"Title":"Union Street And Blow Your House Down","review":"Pat Barker's earlier work impresses the reader with the same fearless vision that brought her fame with \\"The Regeneration Trilogy.\\" Her compassion, and respect, for the tough lives of the British working class never flags. She sees her characters, whether they are admirable or not, as complex people with challenges in life that would make most of us shake our heads and give up. But they don't give up, they persevere to do the best they can for one another and especially for their children. Her honest writing drives right through the depressing aspects of their lives, not avoiding them for a moment, and comes out on the other side with real understanding and admiration for the human spirit they embody. I have now read all of her work to day, and continue to count her among my most admired living writers."},{"Title":"Union Street And Blow Your House Down","review":"'Blow your house down' by the wonderful Pat Barker, handles working class, northern women in such a non-judgemental, fragile fashion, it is ever so difficult to perhaps judge them from your own point of view. Rather than portray these women, as sad, desperate and dirty, Pat barker has written about strong, determined, inderpendant working mothers, lovers and friends. 'Blow your house down' recognises the dreary, miserable, mangled environment these women are forced to work in as a result of their own situations, which life has left them in.The main story line tells us of a murderer who kills one of the prostitutes. It establishes the fact that no matter how much danger is lurking in and out of these women's lives, they still carry on working the streets, earning their living. Still haunted by their friends murder, they don't reject their own lives- they risk them.A truly good, honest and disturbing read from one of my favourites."},{"Title":"Union Street And Blow Your House Down","review":"very interesting novel which explores the living standards of middle class women.

She is one of the greatest poets of all time, and should be read by everyone who loves poetry (and even those who don't).That said, this is a terrible edition. I was shocked when I opened it in a bookstore, looking to show a friend one of her poems I had just been talking about, to discover that the punctuation had been completely modified. The meanings of some of her best poems hinge on varying interpretations of Dickinson's eccentric punctuation, and to change it seems to me one of the great crimes against poetry.

However--I must say--that I am sorely disappointed with this edition of selected poems. As one of the other reviewers has stated, this edition has been greatly tampered with--the editors have reworked the punctuation and capitalization stylistic genius of Dickinson and bastardized it to accommodate the modern reader--but, honestly, to do this severely detracts from Dickinson's so very unique voice. Particularly, the editors employed the comma as a replacement for her frivolous usage of the dash, which left me squirming in distaste--it nearly ruins the poems in my opinion. To \\"fix\\" a poem--punctuation or otherwise--is to change the very essence behind it--I was very surprised the editors would take such strange liberties in modifying these poems. If you're a stickler about poetry, this is not the edition for you.

But this is hardly fair. Even with the world's finest writers such as Marlowe and Dickens, not every single thing they write can be a masterpiece. But what makes &quot;The Two Gentleman of Verona&quot; worth reading? Well, Shakespeare presents us with a valid theme. (Conflicts often exist between romance and friendship.) There is also beautiful language. Launce and his dog offer some interesting comedy as well as a beautiful and memorable passage in 2.3. The scene where Valentine is accepted amonst the outlaws is memorable. This is Shakespeare's first play where a woman (Julia) disuises herself as man to do some investigating. It is also easy to see that several elements of this play were used in &quot;Romeo and Juliet.&quot; To be sure, this is not a masterpiece like &quot;The Comedy of Errors,&quot; &quot;Richard III,&quot; or &quot;King Lear.&quot; But it is still an good study that is worth some interest."},{"Title":"Two Gentlemen of Verona","review":"Although few would claim that Two Gentlemen of Verona is one of Shakespeare's greatest plays, it is well worth reading in order to serve as a reference for the best of his romantic comedies. In essence, Two Gentlemen of Verona gives you a measuring stick to see the brilliance in the best works.The play has the first of Shakespeare's many brave, resourceful and cross-dressing heroines, Julia.Shakespeare always used his fools and clowns well to make serious statements about life and love, and to expose the folly of the nobles. Two Gentlemen of Verona has two very fine comic scenes featuring Launce. In one, he lists the qualities of a milk maid he has fallen in love with and helps us to see that love is blind and relative. In another, he describes the difficulties he has delivering a pet dog to Silvia on his master, Proteus', behalf in a way that will keep you merry on many a cold winter's evening.The story also has one of the fastest plot resolutions you will ever find in a play. Blink, and the play is over. This nifty sleight of hand is Shakespeare's way of showing that when you get noble emotions and character flowing together, things go smoothly and naturally.The overall theme of the play develops around the relative conflicts that lust, love, friendship, and forgiveness can create and overcome. Proteus is a man who seems literally crazed by his attraction to Silvia so that he loses all of his finer qualities. Yet even he can be redeemed, after almost doing a most foul act. The play is very optimistic in that way.I particularly enjoy the plot device of having Proteus and Julia (pretending to be a page) playing in the roles of false suitors for others to serve their own interests. Fans of Othello will enjoy these foreshadowings of Iago.The words themselves can be a bit bare at times, requiring good direction and acting to bring out the full conflict and story. For that reason, I strongly urge you to see the play performed first. If that is not possible, do listen to an audio recording as you read along. That will help round out the full atmosphere that Shakespeare was developing here.After you finish Two Gentlemen of Verona, think about where you would honor friendship above love, where equal to love, and where below love. Is friendship less important than love? Or is friendship merely less intense? Can you experience both with the same person?Enjoy close ties of mutual commitment . . . with all those you feel close to!"},{"Title":"Two Gentlemen of Verona","review":"&quot;The Two Gentlemen of Verona&quot; is one of my favorite Shakespeare plays. Maybe that's because it's one of the only one's I understand. My youth Theatre did a wonderful production of this play. I was not in it, but I saw it twice. It was set in the 60's, peasant-shirted and bell-bottomed. I think it's a wonderful story, although a bit unrealistic because of all the forgiveness that happens at the end of the play. But I think that it's a play everyone should read. This edition of the play is, I think, a very good one. If you are planning to buy a copy of &quot;The Two Gentlemen of Verona,&quot; I would advise you to buy the most current edidtion printed by the Folger Shakespeare Library. They have lots of information in the book, and many definitions of the more difficult Elizabethian words."},{"Title":"Two Gentlemen of Verona","review":"It is true that this work is not among Shakespeare's greatest by any stretch of the imagination. This entire play reflects the immaturity of a young William Shakespeare. What makes the play so interesting however, are the themes that are explored within the play. He compares the love between a man and a woman with the friendship between two people to see which is more powerful. In addition, Shakespeare uses three fools (or rather two fools and a clown) to enhance the comedic elements of the play. While the plot may not be entirely believeable or even politically correct in today's society, when taken in context, this play is still worth the time and money."},{"Title":"Two Gentlemen of Verona","review":"Does love trump friendship?Proteus and Valentine are friends living in Verona. Valentine is off to Milan to experience the world. Valentine would wish Proteus to follow him, but Proteus loves Julia, secretly, and Valentine knows that a fool in love will not leave the object of his affection. Proteus's father approves of Valentine's example however and, not knowing his son is in love, sends him off to follow Valentine.While in Milan Valentine finds love too in the person of the Duke's daughter, Silvia. He now realizes that his friend was not so foolish after all. The Duke has promised Silvia to one Thurio. Valentine and Silvia plan to Elope. Proteus arrives in Milan, immediately loses his love for Julia and falls also in love with Silvia. He betrays Valentine's plan to the Duke who banishes Valentine. Proteus tries to have Silvia fall in love in love with him. And then Julia shows up.Speed and Launce, the two fools, serve Valentine and Proteus respectively. Launce understands his master wrongs Valentine. \\"I am but a fool, look you, and yet I have the wit to think my master is a kind of knave.\\" (Act III scene 1 line 261) Of course he is! I never held with the saying that all is fair in love in war. Not only is Proteus betraying his friend, he is also betraying Julia.Valentine takes up with outlaws, yet in the end everything resolves itself. Amazingly, both Julia and Valentine forgive Proteus. Valentine and Silvia marry, with the Duke's and Thurio's blessing. Thurio especially deserves mention; he gives up an advantageous political marriage simply because Silvia doesn't love him! A wise man.But the real spice in this play comes from Speed and Launce. Launce goes to and fro at a slow pace, often holding his dog. Himself uneducated, he educates listeners with his mistakes and malapropisms, which are perhaps foolish but not unwise. Speed, as befits his name, dashes here and there, makes one pun after another, confuses and confounds his masters. He electrifies the play, somewhat as does Ariel in the Tempest.It's an entertaining play, with Shakespeare's message being plain and clear: stay true to your friends and to your love.Vincent Poirier, Tokyo"},{"Title":"Two Gentlemen of Verona","review":"One of Shakespeare's earliest plays, \\"The Two Gentlemen of Verona\\" reflects the novice playwright's skills. Plotting weaknesses and anachronisms detract from the play. Still, there is a lot to love about this piece.One of the play's greatest strengths is the character of Launce. He is one of the funniest clowns that I have read in Shakespeare, and the two monologues Shakespeare gives him are not only laugh out loud funny, and incredibly witty, they also have very touching and human elements. In performance this character would steal the show.Being a young man when he wrote \\"Two Gentlemen\\" it is no wonder that the focus of the text is friendship between two young men, and how romance changes friendships. I wish Shakespeare had explored this theme more, but he does some decent things with it here through the characters of Proteus and Valentine (the gentlemen of the title). Proteus is a real piece of work and I don't understand why Valentine loves this man, but such is the nature of friendship and love. It rarely makes sense to observers of it.A major weakness of the play is the ridiculously tidy and very quick ending in Act 5:4. Valentine catches his friend betraying him, and threatening rape of his betrothed, and he forgives him in less then a minute. Obviously unbelievable! The two main female characters (Silvia and Julia) are also underdeveloped, and frankly not that interesting. I imagine it would be quite hard for an actress to make them compelling, especially if she was playing Julia.Still, \\"Two Gentlemen\\" is a delightful read and I am anxious to see it performed. It would be a fun evening. In giving this play 3 stars, I am comparing it against Shakespeare's other work, not against any other writer.As for the Pelican Shakespeare series, they are my favorite editions as the scholarly research is usually top notch and the editions themselves look good as an aesthetic unit. It looks and feel like a play and this compliments the text's contents admirably. The Pelican series was recently reedited and has the latest scholarship on Shakespeare and his time period.

Consequently, there are many sites in Prague that are of some interest to fans of Kafka's work. Klaus Wagenbach's little \\"Travel Reader\\" highlights most of these sites (e.g., the writer's birthplace, all the Kafka family residences around Old Town Square, Kafka's apartment in the castle, etc.). If you're headed to Prague, you could easily spend half a day retracing Kafka's footsteps with this guide. The book includes a map and numerous photographs of the city as it appeared about 100 years ago so you can contrast today's Prague with the Prague Kafka new. It also includes some short excerpts from Kafka's works, mostly vignettes like the haunting \\"An Imperial Edict\\", included next to the sections on the buildings where Kafka lived.I lived in Prague myself for a month this summer and frequently took this book along with me on my evening jaunts through town. The selections from the writer's work included here helped add personal and emotional meaning to what otherwise might have been just a bunch of buildings. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The discarded image: An introduction to medieval and Renaissance literature","review":"The title sounds like something for the specialist in Medieval literature, doesn't it? Don't be put off by that or by the subject matter. There are a number of reasons to read this book.Here is Lewis the common teacher, not the religious writer. You will find no polemic here. But, paradoxically, Lewis may be more persuasive and display more passion when he is neither trying to persuade nor be passionate. This book originated in a series of lectures, and it shows. There is love for both subject and reader on every page. Lewis writes simply and beautifully, so those of you interested in fine prose will find much here.Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the book is the comparison Lewis draws between ancient and Medieval thought and the modern. Sometimes these comparisons are direct, but more often they are subtle, implicit. But, by continually pairing the two worldviews, whether directly or not, Lewis leads us, like the master teacher he was, to reflect on our own way of thinking.For example, Lewis highlights good and bad aspects of Medieval writing. For one, Medieval writing revels in detail. This can be rich or boring, depending. But, the reason for such detail, Lewis suggests, is that Medieval writers were contemplating a world they loved and felt part of. Thus, to a lover, details about one's beloved are never overdone. In contrast, most of us feel somewhat alienated in today's society, don't we? And, isn't this reflected in contemporary novels?Lewis also suggests that Medieval writers copied earlier writers. Early writings are, like Cathedrals, products of many craftsmen. The need to be original or creative was subsumed by humility. Medieval writers did not want focus, like so many of today's artists, on themselves. Instead, they wanted to direct attention to contemplation of the figures and subjects of their writing. Pride in craft may have been present, but is was subordinate to love of subject."},{"Title":"The discarded image: An introduction to medieval and Renaissance literature","review":"\\"The Discarded Image: An Introduction to Medieval and Renaissance Literature\\", by C. S. Lewis, has the benefit of the author's lifetime of study in two great ages: the Pagan Classical that perished, and the Christian Medieval that rose in its place. The latter cannot be understood properly without the former, and our modern age is best known in understanding both. The author's objective is to instruct us in that understanding.I count Lewis among my favorite authors, but after being exposed to deeper and more orthodox writers over the years I've come to read him - if still very enjoyably - much more carefully. While I agree with the unanimous reviews that glowingly praise this work, he does strike some discordant notes. Lewis was a loyal member of that church \\"by law established\\" and its divines, including the heretic Cranmer and the latitudinarian Hooker, helped shape his thought. This is a High-Church Anglican's take on the Middle Ages.The first item that really stands out is that someone with no previous knowledge of the Middle Ages may get wrong notions about the relative importance of its writers. Milton is consulted much more often than Dante, even though the latter is the epitome of the Medieval poet, while Milton is considered by most to be a later, paler imitation. Aquinas gets a handful of mentions, about the same as Donne; Albert gets a nod or two, while Petrarch and Boccaccio are barely acknowledged. Bede is mentioned once in passing. Chaucer, Gower and Spencer are dominant. The heavy leaning on the English writers doesn't invalidate Lewis' view of the Medieval Model, but the reader relying primarily on him will miss a good portion of its detail.Another note of discord is that Lewis drops hints about misperceptions of the period, but he never follows up or explains their importance. For instance, in the section on Cicero's De Republica (page 28) Lewis says his attitude to the body was to be an \\"unfortunate legacy\\" for Medieval Christians. Exactly how was this problem unique to Medieval Christians? The idea of the soul being in exile in the (evil) body and being free upon death was a Gnostic heresy from the very birth of the Church. Manichaeism in subsequent centuries had a large following (St. Augustine before his conversion for one), and Catharism (which originated with the Bulgars in the east) was vigorously fought against by the Medieval Church. The puritanical idea of man's total depravity until this mortal coil is shed was a very much more unfortunate legacy for Reformation-era Christians than for Medieval ones.Along this same line, Lewis rather astoundingly says that the cult of the saints (more than that of the angels) was \\"a danger to monotheism in the Middle Ages.\\" He doesn't elaborate further, but I will: veneration of the Blessed Virgin and the cult of the saints was part of Christianity since its beginnings; the relics in the catacombs and other archaeological findings speak to their importance dating to the 1st Century. As far back as the Old Testament, the bones of the patriarchs are treated with reverence. Interestingly, the Latin Christians received this practice from the East. It wasn't until the Islamic conquests of the seventh century that the shrines of the Holy Land and their relics were destroyed, and it was their influence that helped create the iconoclastic controversy among Greek Christians (I wonder how many Protestants realize their iconoclasm is at root a Muslim thing?) The idea that Dulia and Hyperdulia were a threat to monotheism is a Protestant invention. Richard II had consecrated England to Our Lady, calling his country \\"Mary's Dowry\\"; he knew, as everyone else knew, that the BVM and the saints were created beings not to be confused with God. The improperly understood doctrine of the Trinity is the real danger to monotheism Lewis should have mentioned - just ask any Arian, Sabellian, Docetist, Monophysite, Adoptionist, Nestorian, Socinian, or Unitarian.The Philosophy of History is another topic on which Lewis touches that doesn't ring true. To my chagrin, he deprecates the idea by explaining that it is not uniquely Christian since many cultures seemed to have employed similar philosophies, and that even if it were unique, it is not particularly meritorious. In one swoop Lewis wipes out the main thesis of St. Augustine's City of God, and renders Scholastic philosophers from Aquinas to Gilson moot. The problem is that Lewis is just plain wrong: it's one thing to have a sense of \\"destiny\\" or to think of oneself as part of a \\"chosen people\\" - that is not a philosophy - it's quite another to have worked out an entire Soteriological system that includes an event dubbed \\"the fullness of time\\" where God enters carnally into history and redeems sinful man for Himself. The bequeathing of a Philosophy of History to the world is very real, it is uniquely Christian, and there is not now nor has there ever been anything like it in the history of man. This is a big miss by Lewis.Lastly, in this giant bouquet thrown to the Middle Ages, could not a single rose be strewn at the door of the Catholic Church? It's true that when one speaks about Christian belief in Medieval times that one is speaking about the Catholic Church, but Lewis shouldn't assume his readers know that. He uses any form of the word \\"Catholic\\" but once - and that in reference to a book title on page 124, the \\"Catholicon Anglicum\\". How Lewis can delight in the beauty and order of the Medieval Model and not let the reader in on the fact that a key characteristic - its hierarchy - was basically a mirror of the Catholic Church is puzzling. When he discusses how the earth lays on the outskirts of the universal drama, which has its eternal center in God, Lewis missed an opportunity to make the obvious connection to the Catholic Mass. With its vicariousness and its making-present that eternal center on every altar in every Church in the world, Lewis could have drawn the Model more completely and more accurately: the Faith (and Reason) of the Medieval Age informed it's understanding of the physical world, and both of these elements were the foundation of its literature.In closing, I want to note where I think Lewis' deepest understanding of Medieval literature ultimately resided. In another and perhaps his most personal work,A Grief Observed, it is to Dante that Lewis turns to express the moment of his wife's death:\\"She said not to me but to the chaplain, 'I am at peace with God.' She smiled, but not at me. Poi si torno all' eterna fontana\\" [then towards the eternal fountain turn'd - canto XXXI, Paradiso]After challenging some of Lewis' assertions in the above paragraphs, I want to reiterate that there is still a great deal to love about this book. Most of those reasons have been highlighted in other reviews, so I'll have mercy on the reader of this review and simply stop right here."},{"Title":"The discarded image: An introduction to medieval and Renaissance literature","review":"It is difficult to praise \\"The Discarded Image\\" too highly. It can be read with profit many times. Other reviewers have told you why.That said, I would like to say something to those who have read and enjoyed the Space Trilogy, especially \\"Out of the Silent Planet\\" and \\"Perelandra.\\" In writing those excellent stories, Lewis decided that the medieval outlook on cosmology, however incorrect from the scientific standpoint, would provide a marvelous-and to most of us-unfamiliar backdrop for tales of imaginative fiction. I promise you that once you have finished \\"The Discarded Image,\\" you will reread the fictional works pleasantly fascinated by how the medieval image informs the novels."},{"Title":"The discarded image: An introduction to medieval and Renaissance literature","review":"This book is an invaluable introduction to medieval and Renaissance literature, including works as late as Shakespeare's--if you don't understand the material in this book, many of Shakespeare's references will be opaque. Lewis introduces the reader to what it felt like to believe in the hierarchical geocentric cosmos and in other aspects of medieval philosophy. He disposes of common misconceptions--very few medieval thinkers believed in a flat earth, for example--and also explains the medieval outlook toward books and authority. Aside from serving the student of literature, it should be a very handy work for writers and roleplayers."},{"Title":"The discarded image: An introduction to medieval and Renaissance literature","review":"In an all too perfect coincidence, I stumbled upon this line from G.K. Chesterton shortly after finishing The Discarded Image: \\"History is horribly badly taught [because] some thousand years of it has to be made out as much sillier than it was.\\" The thousand years in question are the Middle Ages, a period grossly misunderstood as \\"dark,\\" superstitious, unscientific, and steeped in religious dogmatism by modern people. To return to Lewis, The Discarded Image is a masterful introduction to the literature and worldview of an age that has been \\"made out as much sillier than it was.\\"Lewis begins his book by pointing out that, while medieval people had many superficial similarities to primitive peoples, they were by no means unscientific or superstitious, fearfully guessing in the dark. In order to understand them more fully, one must understand their view of the universe. Lewis is not talking about simple scientific fact--such as the change from a geocentric to a heliocentric solar system--but about the significance of the old worldview, how the medievals viewed the organization and motivation of the universe and, more importantly, what it meant to them as expressed in art.Lewis begins with a discussion of sources. He deliberately avoids the most well-known influences on the Model--works like Virgil's Aeneid or Ovid's Metamorphoses--sticking instead to lesser-known works that more clearly provide examples of the Model in action, like Boethius's Consolation of Philosophy and Cicero's Dream of Scipio. He then proceeds through the Model topically, describing the heavens, earth, and man and describing the organization and characteristics of each.One of The Discarded Image's greatest virtues--at least to me, as a medievalist--is in Lewis's ability to evoke the mindset of medieval people. Modern people are beset by \\"chronological snobbery\\"--a phrase coined by Lewis and his friend Owen Barfield--and almost always conceive of people in the past, especially medieval people, as somehow indescribably stupid. On the contrary, Lewis write that \\"[a]t his most characteristic medieval man was not a dreamer nor a wanderer. He was an organiser, a codifier, a builder of systems. . . . Distinction, definition, tabulation were his delight. . . . There was nothing which medieval people liked better, or did better, than sorting out and tidying up. Of all our modern inventions I suspect that they would most have admired the card index.\\" St. Thomas Aquinas, Dante, the cathedral, the Model itself--all are examples of the medieval talent for taking in and organizing vast numbers of ideas.One of my graduate school professors was fond of saying that \\"the past is a foreign country--they do things differently there.\\" If you think of the past in that way, The Discarded Images is a guidebook, and the central cultural fact one must understand is the medieval and renaissance view of the universe.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The discarded image: An introduction to medieval and Renaissance literature","review":"Although this book was written to introduce students of medieval literature to the subject, it is far more than a book about books. Lewis makes it clear that, to understand men of another time, we must first understand their view of the world, the influences that bore upon them, and how they dealt with them. Most interesting is his use of a 'model' to describe the medieval authors' universe (for only the learned would endeavour to describe a universe), for in our day, thirty-five years after The Discarded Image was written, we place great credence in computer models. Well worth your time, if only to show that there are more ways than one to look at - shall we call it creation? - and there may be truth in more than one of them. We must not lose track, in this hypercritical age, of these different models and modes of thought; it is well, indeed, to remember that a man of 1400 is not to be judged by the standards of 1999. Nor is a modern man to be judged by the standards of half a millennium ago."},{"Title":"The discarded image: An introduction to medieval and Renaissance literature","review":"When I heard for the first time medieval music in undergraduate school, I felt as though I was listening to something created on another planet. Organa, cantus firmi, and unrelenting parallel perfect fifths - my musical palette was surprised, and not particularly pleasantly, by harmonies alternatively and unpredictably bland and bitter. If my guide to the medieval mind had been C. S. Lewis (1898-1963) in The Discarded Image, though he wrote not a word (to my recollection) about medieval music, I might well have been able to hear the ancient tones in a more sympathetic and perceptive way.The \\"discarded image\\" of which he wrote is a \\"model\\" of the universe embraced by the medieval mind. I would call it a worldview, and the medieval model was an attempt to harmonize and internalize a comprehensive understanding of astronomy, geography, biology, metaphysics, history, aesthetics (rhetoric), philosophy, and education in a single, complex, consistent, and beautiful model. His brief discussion on the seven liberal arts was the most illuminating I have read, and his observation of the medieval predilection with \\"triplets\\" and spheres I immediately considered relevant to the music I have heard.As I read his book this week, Lewis first stunned me with the breadth of his scholarship: references, quotes, and footnotes peppered the text throughout, which nonetheless flowed mellifluously along in his approachable and self-effacing voice. Details illuminated, rather than obscured, the big picture painted by the Cambridge professor of medieval and renaissance English. On every page, one sensed the delight with which Lewis approached his subject, and I will confess to having succumbed to his enthusiasm.With such a guide, I found that comparisons between the medieval model and our own worldview(s) were most illuminating. For example, in his brief discussion of the rational soul - in more modern thinking rationality consists mostly of logical argument while in the medieval model the rational soul included also a sense of morality - stimulated me to question the assumption of my own time. He noted, too, the medieval humility toward creative work, unleashing a sense of unstrained ease; and the more modern focus upon individual creativity, providing more of a constrained, and, on occasion contrived, sense of hard work in poetry and literature.A valuable work for any teacher of medieval history, this book provides wonderful insight into the medieval mind and worldview. For how are we to understand our own world unless we understand it in comparison with the alien and foreign medieval one, explained and illuminated so skillfully by this master teacher and scholar?"},{"Title":"The discarded image: An introduction to medieval and Renaissance literature","review":"I was given this book as a graduation present by a high school English teacher because I was, she said, \\"the only student who has ever remarked on how well C. S. Lewis writes when he is writing criticism.\\" (I had done a project for class on one of Lewis' earlier works of literary criticism, written in his 20's, called The Allegory of Love, and had noticed in that book the same extroardinarily clear style and sentence structure which a non-Christian writer relative of mine had pointed out to me when I was a child and had helped me to analyze in the opening pages of The Horse and His Boy.)Based on a collection of lectures which Lewis gave to undergraduates at Oxford, (a literary equivalent to that other college freshman favorite, The Feynman Lectures on Physics), this book does refer to many medieval authors whom I hadn't yet read at 17 and may never read, and yet I did find it extremely useful, both to understand more about the philosophical underpinnings of Lewis' fiction, and to use as supplemental reading for a college freshman English course in medieval literature (the Song of Roland, Dante, Petrarch, Tasso, Boccacio, Chaucer, etc., all in translation). As other reviewers have remarked, this book and Lewis' The Abolition of Man are especially helpful as background reading for understanding Lewis' Space Trilogy.An especially enjoyable aspect of The Discarded Image, and a general characteristic of many of Lewis' books both fiction and nonfiction, is that one can read it again thirty years after one has first read it, and still find it useful and enjoyable in new ways. One cannot say this about many of the current, flash-in-the-pan best-sellers on history, liteature, or various aspects of modern culture, which barely stand up to a single reading, or should I say, a single \\"Glimpse!\\". (Certain tittillating pseudohistorical thriller novels and their movie versions also come to mind here).In other words, this book competes well with both the current crop of leisure-non-fiction best-sellers, and also with the tried-and-true college freshman classics. Much as I admire Mr. Feynman, I don't recall having had occasion to dip into his Lectures on Physics after the course ended, but I have and still do re-read portions of Mr. Lewis' The Discarded Image from time to time for mere enjoyment.In short, this book is an excellent investment--you won't want to sell it to the used book shop for pennies in a year or two, nor leave it in the metro station paperback-swap-rack for some other commuter, nor yet abandon it in the airport baggage claim area having skimmed it on the plane, but will want to keep it for yourself and treasure it to read and reread for years to come.If this book were a person, one could almost imagine singing to it, \\"Believe me, if all those endearing young charms which I gaze on so fondly today....\\"!"},{"Title":"The discarded image: An introduction to medieval and Renaissance literature","review":"Highly recommended for students of history as well as literature. A product of C. S. Lewis's day job at Cambridge, this volume helps the reader get inside the mind of both the common man and the writers of this period. They had a different view of reality and the world than modern man. To understand, let alone appreciate their history and literatue, you need to know how they saw things.Broader and more scholarly that Lewis' \\"Studies in Medieval and Renaissance Literature\\" (Canto, 1966), I recommend \\"The Discarded Image\\" over it.By the way, though not intended as such, it's also a great source of trivia on the origins of names and expressions."},{"Title":"The discarded image: An introduction to medieval and Renaissance literature","review":"This book is a great, very accessible introduction to Medieval culture, seen through the literature of the time.

Lewis's book is well-written and well-researched. He does reference so many works that it gets a bit difficult to keep track of everything, but that doesn't detract from the reading-enjoyment of the book. He uses some Greek words in the original alphabet, which I wasn't even sure how to pronounce, let alone, deduce the meanings."},{"Title":"The discarded image: An introduction to medieval and Renaissance literature","review":"This is definitely the best book written on medieval literature to this day.

The effortlessness and confidence Lewis shows in making his points are especially enjoyable. In a lot of literary scholarship, writers labor somewhat defensively and heavy-handedly to convey their insights, like a gladiator armed for battle, but much of Lewis's appeal lies in the ease and naturalness of his erudition. His mastery of the subject is so complete he can discuss it in a completely relaxed yet still authoritative manner. For example, in the last chapter, he names what he sees as the typical vice of medieval literature, which \\"as we all know, is its dulness: sheer, unabashed, prolonged dulness, where the author does not seem to be even trying to interest us\\" (p. 204). That may be the most amazing sentence in the book--dullness as the result not of an underprepared or -informed reader but of the writers. Lewis goes on to contexualize and (maybe) diminish this occasional dullness in light of the paradigm about the age he has presented. But how refreshing is his candor in making such a concession about the literature he cherishes!In spite of its subtitle, the book seems to treat the literature of the Renaissance as a kind of appendage or afterthought to the literature of the medieval age. Lewis gives some explanation for this (bottom paragraph on page 13), but his copious ability to quote from such a wide range of works from antiquity, the Middle Ages, and later centuries (one reference even to Rider Haggard's SHE) coupled with the force of his analogies and examples, makes you want to overlook any slighted focus on the later age."},{"Title":"The discarded image: An introduction to medieval and Renaissance literature","review":"*****Lewis' \\"The Discarded Image,\\" is evocative, informative, and 100% edifying.

Once years ago, for an essay I was writing, and then again after I read Michael Ward's brilliant book \\"Planet Narnia.\\" Ward's books have opened up to me a whole new world of Lewisian perspective and scholarship.The Discarded Image is a must-read if you want to understand pretty much anything about Lewis' understanding.

Lewis provides a fantastic and insightful look into the Middle Ages with \\"The Discarded Image.\\" This book was a required reading for a Middle English Literature class I took; when read concurrently with the actual Middle English texts, it was both illuminating and entertaining. It paints an amazing portrait of how the medieval English man would have viewed the world. If this perspective is applied when reading Middle English poetry (and prose), many of the \\"Huh?\\" moments we have when puzzling out what a Middle English poet or playwright might have meant suddenly begin to make sense. Lewis provides an accurate context for the literature, allowing us to leave the 21st century mindset many of us have when reading \\"antiquated\\" literature.That said, I would say the book's true merits don't necessarily rely in its specific explanations and references - indeed, while Lewis openly claims that the book serves as a layman's guide to Middle English literature, his writing seems to presuppose extensive exposure to many Middle English texts. Rather, Lewis' brilliance comes through in the insights he provides into humanity: his thoughts on the acquisition of ideas, the inheritance of literature and culture, and his hypothesis of the \\"model\\" are applicable to far more than just the Middle Ages. In reality, the book illustrates that connections that exist between ALL literature, not just that of ages past.All in all, the book provides a nice duality of information: it is specific enough for those looking to delve into Middle English literature while retaining the ability to be universally applied to other areas as well."},{"Title":"The discarded image: An introduction to medieval and Renaissance literature","review":"This book explained and gave amazing and insightful information about the development of the medieval worldview and mindset."},{"Title":"The discarded image: An introduction to medieval and Renaissance literature","review":"For those interested in studying medieval and renaissance literature, this book is all but indispensible for understanding the world view of the writers of that period (and thus understanding the books they wrote.)

The barbarian legacy is disguised. Medieval man was a codifier, a builder of systems. There was a Model of the Universe, a construct of answered questions. In the classical period the concept of Nature was greater than the goddess embodying it. The angels of Scholasticism are the gods or aetherial creatures of the classical era. Apuleius and Plato used what Lewis calls the Principle of the Triad. Third things functiuoned as bridges between the other two.Plotinus marks a transitional period, 200 to 500, when the medieval frame comes into being. The era includes the reigns of Constantine, Christian, and Julian, the attempt at a Pagan revival. Each side had the same educational attributes. Although Plotinus is a genius, Lewis contends that Porphyry is the more influential writer. Chalcidius transmitted Plato and produces the richest results in the work of the twelfth century Latin poets. The contribution of pseudo-Dionysius to the Medieval Model is his angeology, CELESTIAL HIERARCHIES. Boethius's CONSOLATION OF PHILOSOPHY should be noted here. He was a scholar and aristocrat.The medieval universe is finite. There are moral and emotional consequences to cosmic dimensions. The four elements, hot, cold, moist, dry are present in Milton, Cervantes, Spenser. God causes the Primum Mobile to rotate. (The planets retained their Pagan names and qualities.) There is a relationship to Aristotle's Prime Mover. Fortune is a wheel. Everything below the moon is mutable. The four humors vary daily and individually.History and fiction cannot be distinguished in medieval books. Medieval narratives of the past lack a sense of period. There are seven liberal arts, the TRIVIUM, and the QUADRIVIUM. Medieval poetry is filled with solid instruction.

Readers who insist on reading works of the period with their modernism intact are &quot;as travellers who carry their resolute Englishry with them all over the continent, mixing only with other English tourists, enjoying all they see for its 'quaintness', and having no wish to realise what those ways of life, those churches, those vineyards, mean to the natives.&quot; While Lewis says &quot;I have no quarrel with people who approach the past in that spirit&quot;, he also says of them, in a somewhat chilling echo of the Sermon on the Mount: &quot;They have their reward.&quot;It is to those who want a much greater reward that Lewis directs &quot;The Discarded Image.&quot; While he provides the reader with hard information concerning medieval philosophy, cosmology, biology, education and literature, imparting the individual facts is the lesser part of his purpose. What he really aims at is to completely detach the reader from all of the unconscious beliefs and attitudes that a lifetime spent in modern culture brings, and substitute for them those of the educated medieval man.What the description I've just given you of this book does not do is to describe what the experience of having that done to you is like. I found it compelling and disorienting. One by one, the familiar intellectual landmarks were stripped away from my mental image of the world, and strange new ones put into their place. Vertigo is the word that comes closest to describing the feeling; I found I had to stop reading every couple dozen pages to give myself time to recover. This was so even though my familiarity with the philosophy, theology, and cosmology of the period was, by any non-specialist standard, quite high. The reason, I think was not so much that my knowledge was inferior to Lewis' (although of course it certainly was) as that I had only thought of these matters from an external &quot;objective&quot; point of view - I had never before tried to actually enter into that view of the world before. The result of Lewis' instruction on the matter was a combination of delight at the new insights so gained and humiliation at the revelation of the deep limitations of the &quot;knowledge&quot; I had possessed before.In sum, I found reading &quot;the Discarded Image&quot; to be an extraordinary experience, and its value in no way depends on my using the information gained to identify some off-hand reference of Chaucer's.

Don't be put off by that or by the subject matter. There are a number of reasons to read this book.Here is Lewis the common teacher, not the religious writer. You will find no polemic here. But, paradoxically, Lewis may be more persuasive and display more passion when he is neither trying to persuade nor be passionate. This book originated in a series of lectures, and it shows. There is love for both subject and reader on every page. Lewis writes simply and beautifully, so those of you interested in fine prose will find much here.Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the book is the comparison Lewis draws between ancient and Medieval thought and the modern. Sometimes these comparisons are direct, but more often they are subtle, implicit. But, by continually pairing the two worldviews, whether directly or not, Lewis leads us, like the master teacher he was, to reflect on our own way of thinking.For example, Lewis highlights good and bad aspects of Medieval writing. For one, Medieval writing revels in detail. This can be rich or boring, depending. But, the reason for such detail, Lewis suggests, is that Medieval writers were contemplating a world they loved and felt part of. Thus, to a lover, details about one's beloved are never overdone. In contrast, most of us feel somewhat alienated in today's society, don't we?Lewis also suggests that Medieval writers copied earlier writers. Early writings are, like Cathedrals, products of many craftsmen. The need to be original or creative was subsumed by humility. Medieval writers did not want focus, like so many of today's artists, on themselves. Instead, they wanted to direct attention to contemplation of the figures and subjects of their writing.

It is also no secret that he was a master of discursive, analytical, sympathetic literary criticism. (The collection of articles published posthumously as &quot;On Literature&quot; by Walter Hooper contains some fine examples.)We are also only too well acquainted with Lewis the bully, abusing his prodigious gifts as a debater and marshaller of arguments in the service of his religion. &quot;Mere Christianity&quot; is an overwhelming argument for God - but it leaves the bitter aftertaste of intellectual coercion.In &quot;The Discarded Image&quot;, he does not wish to convince us of anything. He only wishes to explain. We are invited along on a tour of the beliefs and opinions about the world held in the Middle Ages. (The travel-guide metaphor is Lewis's own, from the Introduction.) The effect is of an immensely well-informed and articulate man discursing on his favourite subject.Mere knowledge and enthusiasm on the part of the author would not be enough to make this unusual book interesting. It is Lewis's combination of strengths as writer that bring Medieval cosmology, religion and science to life. But such is his skill that we almost don't notice what has gone into the presentation. Only when we reflect on what must have been required to organise facts, determine what is essential, leave out what isn't, use analogies, draw distinctions, make comparisons and follow lines of thought does the achievement really sink in.For example, his description of Arisotlean astronomy and its legacy to the Middle Ages is a masterpiece of brevity. It tells us everything we need to know for what follows, and nothing more; yet simutaneously we experience a sense of the vastness of the subject-matter. Our curiosity is awakened, our immediate needs satisfied and our imagination stimulated. THIS is writing!The section on Mother Nature shows Lewis the philologist to great effect. He first has to disengage our minds from the modern conception of Nature, which he does by investigating what we actually do mean by the word nowadays and how that has evolved over three hundred years. At that point, we are ready to understand the entirely different relationship to the world that was conveyed by the same word in the Middle Ages.Throughout, there is not a wasted word or an unnecessary turn of phrase.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The discarded image: An introduction to medieval and Renaissance literature","review":"This is one of Lewis's more difficult-to-find academic works. However, if you find it and read it, you will not be disappointed. I read the book on my own initiative while taking a master's class in Medieval literature. I probably learned as much from his book as I did from the whole class, and it opened up countless delightful possibilities for future enquiry. It also gave me a great idea for my final paper, which I'd been lacking the inspiration to write.What's more, this work is still respected in academia. Recently I was reading a Cambridge thesis on the subject of early printing (The Printing Revolution in Early Modern Europe by Elizabeth L. Eisenstein) and came across a quote from _The Discarded Image_ (an uncited quote, which was annoying, but that's another story). Eisenstein quotes most authors in order to disagree with them, but she didn't disagree with Lewis (added to him, qualified him, but didn't disagree), which was unusual. Lewis was one of the few authors in her field that Eisenstein did not attack! I also passed _The Discarded Image_ along to one of my previous college professors and he decided to include ideas from it in his Survey of English Literature course.If you want to know how medieval men and women saw their world-their belief in supernatural beings intermediate between angels and devils, their admiration for all kinds of organization, their heavy reliance on the snippet of Plato to which they had access-read this book. You will never see the Middle Ages quite the same way again."},{"Title":"The discarded image: An introduction to medieval and Renaissance literature","review":"I was pleased to see a reference to Thomas Kuhn's \\"The Structure of Scientific Revolutions\\" by a previous reviewer. This reviewer has, I believe, achieved an understanding of the heart of what Lewis was trying to gain here: the ability to insert, into the minds of his readers, a contingent understanding of the frames within which the Middle Ages reading public saw their world.What Lewis is describing was not metaphysics. It was real physics, the way real people looked at a real world. \\"It was not true,\\" Lewis admits, but he goes on to make two further claims that cannot, I think, be disproved:1. The medieval model of the universe was filled with \\"delight.\\" It was beautiful in a way that inspired poets and artists of all sorts to creativity. Lewis points out that the mentality of a creative artist of the Middle Ages, inspired by the Discarded Image as a model of the universe, was much less egotistical than many creative people are expected to be today. Artists routinely produced masterpieces and then did not sign them. Simply working on a corner of the Model was enough.2. The medieval model of the universe was not true and has since been disproved by modern physics, but we can have no assurance that the models we follow and believe in today are true, either. In fact, to philosophers of human thinking like Kuhn and Lewis, every \\"model\\" that we come to believe in from time to time is contingent; all of them either have been, or some day will be, superseded by new models.Lewis was a Christian, and he felt an Appreciative-love for the European Middle Ages that he wanted his readers to share. I hope the readers of this review will believe me when I say that Lewis did not over-play his own religion in this book. He fearlessly makes it clear that, if the Middle Ages and their aesthetic model of the universe had aspects of beauty in them, these aspects were as likely to be due to elements of pagan survival as they were to Christianity. We are repeatedly reminded that the European Middle Ages were not a high-tech, totalitarian theocracy, but a very poor world in which a wide variety of Christian and pre-Christian cultural forces jostled with each other."},{"Title":"The discarded image: An introduction to medieval and Renaissance literature","review":"G.K. Chesterton once said that the hidden feature of God is His mirth. Perhaps this, too, is Mr. Lewis' hidden feature. He had the last laugh in his last book. For most of his literary career, especially after his thunderous critique of what he called \\"modernism,\\" which now is labeled \\"post-modernism,\\" in The Abolition of Man, Mr. Lewis decried our reductionistic models of both man and the universe. Post-Christian views in science and literature, he argued over and over again, are brittle, hopeless, and utterly without joy. If we cling to our modernist (now post-modernist) models, we will not survive, he kept claiming. Of course, Mr. Lewis knew that to say this out-right would offend, so he carefully cloaked his message in such classic stories as The Chronicles of Narnia and Perelandra. The messages from stories are more easily received than a whack on the head. He told stories about how modern man was destroying himself by denying God and truth. Do you, dear reader, realize that Mr. Lewis was telling you another story across the entire book, The Discarded Image? He used the literature of the Medieval and Renaissance periods to let you know that your current models are wrong. Of course, he was aware that the details of the Medieval model were also wrong. Are all models wrong? Yes, because a model is an imperfect representation of reality. Our models will always be wrong, but we must keep trying to create better ones. The modern model is less effective than the Medieval one because today we repudiate tradition (see page 211) and with great pride we place ourselves at the top of the evolutionary hierarchy (as we condemn the idea of hierarchy!) (see this message repeated on pages 74, 85, 185, and 220. He was not repeating this theme for nothing. In contrast to the modern model of man and universe, the Medievalist humbly placed himself at the bottom of the hierarchy with God at the top. Though Mr. Lewis is clear that he does not want to return to the Medieval model of man and the universe, he challenges us to create the more complete post-post-modern model that restores God to His rightful place. There it is in black and white on page 221: \\"...when changes in the human mind produce a sufficient disrelish of the old Model and a sufficient hankering for some new one, phenomena to support that new one will obediently turn up. I do not at all mean that these new phenomena are illusory. Nature has all sorts of phenomena in stock and can suit many different tastes.\\" Translation: If society is hell-bent upon finding evidence for the supremacy of man (philosophical, theological, scientific) it will be found. If society is heaven-bent upon finding evidence for the supremacy of God, it will be found. This is Mr. Lewis's final message to us: Open your heart to God and your mind will find the evidence and the models, that are developed in your society, will follow. I have to chuckle when reviewers praise this book because it is a \\"refreshing\\" departure from Mr. Lewis' Christian writings. On the contrary, he has just told you of his Christian beliefs cloaked in cogent analyses of Medieval literature rather than in stories for children. His mirth is showing."},{"Title":"The discarded image: An introduction to medieval and Renaissance literature","review":"\\"The Discarded Image\\" first appeared in print in 1964, the year following Lewis' death. It first appeared in paperback in 1967, and my copy of that edition is heavily marked up and falling to pieces after years of use, in High School and as an undergraduate and graduate student. It is safe to conclude that I am an admirer of the book. (Also of Lewis' fiction, and his other works of criticism; with a few exceptions, the books on Christianity which made him widely known are of little interest to me.)It contains the substance (and presumably the final wording) of Lewis' lecture series introducing medieval and Renaissance literature at Oxford, and, presumably, reflects what he taught his students at Oxford, and, at end of his life, was trying to establish at Cambridge. It is admirably concise, remarkably clear, and, for anyone who does not remember that it is described as only an introduction, at times frustratingly limited. In a very few pages he encapsulates some of the main features of European thought between, roughly, the fall of the Western Roman Empire and the publication of \\"Paradise Lost\\". It represents the essence of a lifetime of actually reading the literature, and he is able to illustrate his points with convincing, and sometimes rather obscure, examples.On the basis of my own experience, \\"The Discarded Image\\" is helpful not only in understanding the literature of the Christian West during the Middle Ages, but also a lot of Jewish and (to a somewhat lesser extent) Islamic literature from the same period. Ptolemy and Aristotle, at least, seem to have been everywhere.In this context, it is perhaps fair to warn potential readers coming to the book directly from Lewis-the-Christian that he displays throughout a remarkable sympathy for a variety of views (pagan, Neo-Platonic, medieval Catholic, and so forth) which they may find disturbing. Education, not edification, is his primary focus. (Of course, there are those who refuse to consider Lewis a real Christian at all, but an agent of the Devil, and possibly even the Pope -- but they probably wouldn't dream of opening this book, anyway.)To use a catch-phrase introduced to scholarship in 1962 by Thomas Kuhn's \\"Structure of Scientific Revolutions,\\" Lewis is presenting an \\"Old Paradigm\\" of the Universe, the very presuppositions of which have been replaced by a series of \\"New Paradigms\\" during the last four centuries. It describes a vast but finite world of natural hierarchies, in which much that we find commonplace was rare (and vice versa). It is an effort to equip the student to think and perhaps even feel in medieval, not modern, terms. I can think of no one who has so successfully evoked the sensation of living in a Ptolemaic or Aristotelian cosmos.By the time this book appeared, Lewis' well-earned reputation as a Christian apologist had largely overtaken his status as a prominent critic of medieval and renaissance literature (established by \\"The Allegory of Love\\" in the 1930s). Although \\"The Discarded Image\\" has generally been in print (about a dozen paperback printings between 1967 and the 1994 \\"Canto\\" edition in slightly larger format, and almost as many since), it never seems to have attained the prominence some (myself included) think it deserves. Even Norman Cantor's praise for the book in \\"Inventing the Middle Ages\\" is moderated by complaints about what it doesn't contain, and the dispatch-like brevity imposed by its origin.It is nice to think that the present \\"Canto\\" edition represents a determination to keep the book available. And the cover illustration of this edition (from an illuminated manuscript of \\"The Romance of the Rose,\\" one of the key works of the High Middle Ages) is certainly more attractive than the blue, with red and white lettering, chosen for the original edition and Cambridge paperback.It was always an attractively written book, and, literally, memorable; perhaps a little too much. With reference to an observation by another reviewer: I can sympathize with anyone found quoting \\"The Discarded Image\\" without attribution. After numerous readings, I have sometimes found it hard to remember just where an idea, or even a turn of phrase, came from, only to recognize it there while looking for something else.(Reposted from my \\"anonymous\\" review of September 10, 2003)"},{"Title":"The discarded image: An introduction to medieval and Renaissance literature","review":"To begin with, it must be acknowledged that the subtitle of this work is apt to be misinterpreted. Lewis's last book of his own initiative, which but for some late corrections would have been published in the final months of his life, might be better understood as a 'preface' to mediaeval and Renaissance literature than as what is now most often meant by an 'introduction'. For his stated purpose is not one of identifying, summarizing, and expounding major works, but of explaining the world-view or Model of the universe which informed any educated writer or reader of the time.Lewis is concerned that a student may succeed in achieving a semblance of comprehension yet be wholly mistaken in his or her grasp of mediaeval literature through projecting onto it either very modern ideas or, perhaps worse, modern misconceptions of what our ancestors believed. While he does touch on authors and writings familiar from the average undergraduate survey course, he dwells far more on, and digs more deeply into, somewhat obscure examples which he feels better represent the mindset of the era. Boethius and his THE CONSOLATION OF PHILOSOPHY get particular attention and are alluded to repeatedly throughout. Lewis then proceeds to outline the mediaeval picture of the universe's structure; of the inhabitants it held; and of the psychological, philosophical, and metaphysical aspects which integrated the whole system.All of this gradually reveals a cosmology far more sophisticated and a civilisation rather better informed than they are often credited with being. Understanding of the nature of the universe was not so erroneous as is now generally supposed; and where it was indeed wrong, it was nonetheless remarkably insightful as well as internally consistent. The mediaeval era emerges as the vital and extraordinary world it was, and as a fertile ground in which the so-called 'Renaissance' took root and flourished.Lewis concludes with a cautionary reminder that our own notions of the universe and of 'Reality' itself remain comparatively incomplete and are certain to be superseded one day, not merely by new discoveries but by the ever-shifting philosophies and tastes which determine what questions are asked and thus what answers are found.This is a book I genuinely hope to read again. Parts of it, I confess, were a bit beyond me, if chiefly because I had too little acquaintance with what was under discussion. Even so, Lewis's characteristic wit, conversational style, and contagious enthusiasm succeeded in making me wish to improve my familiarity with his subject. And to inspire such interest is surely a teacher's purpose even more than the mere passing on of information."},{"Title":"The discarded image: An introduction to medieval and Renaissance literature","review":"C.S. Lewis is just such a pleasure to read. And this book is simply a joy. I am a PhD student in medieval history and have read an awful lot of books on the medieval mind and this is by far the best. There is a slight tendency in Lewis' writing to see philosophy as the sole motor of history--but this is to be expected from his generation and it doesn't detract from the picture he paints. The best part about this book is that when I was finished reading it, I loaned it to my mother, who has absolutely no formal medieval training, and she loved it too! It's such a relief to escape the arrogant jargon of academics, that just masks their ignorance and inane analysis, and explore the world of ideas with such a master of clear and honest language."},{"Title":"The discarded image: An introduction to medieval and Renaissance literature","review":"I picked up this book after I had read all of Lewis's fiction and many of his apologetic works. I saw that The Discarded Image had all five-star reviews and thought that it must be amazing. I must admit, I was disappointed at first. Lewis's writing style is just as clear as his other works, but the subject matter is so much more obscure than anything I had read before that I was intimidated.However, the more I read the more I was pulled in to the world Lewis created. I had known that Lewis was an amazing apologist, but here I discovered his genius scholarship as well. He quoted authors I had never heard of but by the time I figured out who they were (thank you google) I was caught like a gnat in the wonderful web of the Medieval world. I felt like I once did as a child, that the world was grand and complex and beautiful.I confess I do not know hardly anything about Medieval or Renaissance literature, but the world that Lewis creates is wonderful to experience. These people did not think like we do, they did not have all the benefits of modern science that we enjoy. It is so difficult for us to imagine the universe as we did, but through Lewis's clear and guiding prose, we can imagine what is must have been like to see the world as a perfect product of a Divine plan.This book is not for those who want an easy read, it is not like Lewis's other works that can just be picked up and read. It is not a book for those who are comfortable in their own era and have no desire to see the world through the eyes of a man in another world. It is, however a book for those who wish to leave behind the trappings of the modern mindset for a while and enter a world where everything has a purpose and place created by and omniscient, omnipotent God.

It was a pleasure to reread it. Wuthering Heights was a mystery to me, and I had no idea what what it was about. It is written as a narrative, and is very effective in painting each character so clearly that I saw each one's face, knew their heart, and liked them or hated them or felt sorry for them, and long before the end knew how I didn't want it to end.

I have purchased these sets for students who also have grown to love the Brontes, so my only reservation in urging people to buy these books is that I will need a few remaining copies to buy for future students, I am sure!

Thus my comments focus on THIS edition of these two justly loved classics.Why pay what can be for many of us a lot of money for a book available in paperback, one might ask?Because a truly beautifully produced book is a thing of joy, forever. It is an enduringly enriching experience to hold a book where the illustrator and the writer are so attuned that one deepens and enhances the work of the other. Remember in \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" going from the black and white of Kansas to the color of Oz? Or hearing the Beatles live instead of on Ed Sullivan? That's what a superb illustrator can do.Because a truly beautifully produced book, with heavy quality paper, strong boards and spine, carefully put together to last is like going into a great museum and being permitted to hold an original, something made with a passion of caring and creation. Such quality honors a great text, reminding us that what is written is not ephemeral but if great---as Wuthering Heights and Jane Eyre are great---can and should be a legacy from generation to generation.This edition is the best I have seen. It IS a truly beautiful book with magnificent illustrations by Fritz Eichelberger like that of Heathcliffe against a tree with branches twisted by winds whose tumult echoes his soul---unforgettable, haunting.

I learned of the book after seeing the Disney 1950s swashbuckler, \\"The Sword and the Rose\\", which is based on this book.The book tells of the trouble-filled courtship of Charles Brandon and the Princess Mary, sister of the English tyrant Henry VIII. The tale is told from the perspective of Brandon's friend and admirer, Edwin Caskoden. There's some fine swashbuckling action, including a positively hair-raising and vicious rapier duel, and lots of romance (in the old sense) and courtship ritual.Gratifyingly, the writing is superb, in that deliciously elegant way that only novels of the 19th and early 20th century can sport. Here's a random sample:\\"'Nonsense!' broke in Brandon. 'Do you think I left all my wits down in Suffolk? Why, man, she is the sister of the king, and is sought by kings and emperors. I might as well fall in love with a twinkling star. Then, besides, my heart is not on my sleeve. You must think me a fool; a poor, enervated, simpering fool like--like--well, like one of those nobles of England. Don't put me down with them, Caskoden, if you would remain my friend.'\\"We both laughed at this sort of talk, which was a little in advance of the time, for a noble, though an idiot, to the most of England was a noble still, God-created and to be adored.\\"Another great bond of sympathy between Brandon and myself was a community of opinion concerning certain theories as to the equality of men and tolerance of religious thought. We believe that these things would yet come, in spite of kingcraft and priestcraft, but wisely kept our pet theories to ourselves; that is between ourselves.\\"Beautifully said, no?By the bye, I'm surprised how nearly \\"The Sword and the Rose\\" film hewed to Major's story.

(For anyone interested in pursueing the wild accusations of the previous reviewer, I would direct you to &quot;toxnet.nlm.nih.gov&quot; for a professional, definitive assessment of nearly every chemical known).Nor is this a recipe book as another reviewer expected.

It is absolutely amazing how many ingredients can be listed on the back of a jar of cleansing cream, a tube of hand cream, or a can of soup. Simply identifying the salt and sugar isn't enough. We need to know about food substitutes, as well as other ingredients, many of them added to improve the appearance of the substance for sale, that can harm us and/or interfere with prescription drugs.Now, you may be concerned about what is in your prescription medication, but if you are like most of us, you probably take over-the-counter drugs without a thought. After all, if they don't have to be licensed and disseminated by a pharmacy, they must be okay. Right? Wrong!! There is something called a synergistic effect. For example, consumers have been warned recently about the interaction between ibuprofen and statin drugs. Unfortunately, by the time the government steps in, many people may have been harmed. It pays to be informed and Winter's books are a good step in that direction.I am a big fan of herbal remedies, but they need to be subjected to research and review in the same way synthetic drugs are studied. Heck, Parsley, can cause skin irritations.If you want to acquire a little light on the subject of ingredients, consider buying all Winter's books. She has been published in Family Circle and Reader's Digest magazines as well as Homeopathic and Herbal publications.Her books are so effective, I wonder how long it will be before the government kills the messenger, not by silencing Winter, but by withholding the identity of the contents of various products and reversing the \`truth in labeling' and \`organic measures enacted in the past. Of course, they can and do go to the other extreme and ban items that are only harmful if they are misused."},{"Title":"CONSUM DICT COSMETIC INGRED N","review":"This book has enabled me to read just about any ingredients list and understand it fairly well, and I have changed some purchasing habits for the better because of it."},{"Title":"CONSUM DICT COSMETIC INGRED N","review":"Once again Winter has provided her readers with a wealth of information in choosing cosmetics and cosmeceuticals.

After reading several of Winter's books on foods and cosmetics, I now consider myself a wiser - and healthier - consumer."},{"Title":"CONSUM DICT COSMETIC INGRED N","review":"I have to say that I was quite disappointed with the 5th edition of this book. Another reviewer made the observation that Winter tip-toed around a lot of issues and I echo that observation. I feel that it weakens the work. There are a number of ingredients whose potential dangers I have read about but I couldn't find any further information in this book. What am I supposed to conclude? That these controversial ingredients are perfectly safe because Winter says &quot;On the basis of available data, the CIR Expert Panel concludes that this ingredient is safe for topical application in the present practices of use and concentration as a cosmetic&quot;? Granted, there were many ingredients that did get a more fair review. Also, this last edition was printed in 1999 and I think we know a lot more now. As a matter of fact, I think that many &quot;bad&quot; ingredients have stopped being used, at least by some of the more conscientious companies. So, I think it's time for a new edition, one that takes into account the progress that has been made in the cosmetics industry and the desire for today's consumers to know about more current research studies. I would recommend Milady's Skin Care and Cosmetic Ingredients Dictionary by N. Michalun, et al, and the Don't Go Shopping books by Paula Begoun over this one.

His writings reflect a strong will and great intelligence. The artistry of his mountain scenes vividly illustrate his book and combined with his witty prose make for a mountaineering classic"},{"Title":"Scrambles amongst the Alps","review":"Originally Published in 1871. Whymper details his Alps climbs in the 1860s with many first ascents including Mont Pelvoux in 1861, Barre des &Eacute;crins in 1864, Mont Dolent and Aiguille d'Argenti&egrave;re in 1864, and Grand Cornier, Pointe Whymper on the Grandes Jorasses, and Aiguille Verte in 1865. But Whymper will always be remembered for the first ascent of the Matterhorn on July 14, 1865.The Matterhorn was considered to be mountaineering's biggest challenge at the time, and Whymper met with failure again and again. Finally on his eighth attempt he finally succeeded, becoming the first man to reach the summit on July 14, 1865.On the descent, tragedy struck when four members of the party slipped and were killed, and only the breaking of the rope saved Whymper and the two remaining guides from the same fate. A controversy ensued as to whether the rope had actually been cut, but a formal investigation could not find any proof.The accident haunted Whymper: \\"Every night, do you understand, I see my comrades of the Matterhorn slipping on their backs, their arms outstretched, one after the other, in perfect order at equal distances - Croz the guide, first, then Hadow, then Hudson, and lastly Douglas. Yes, I shall always see them.\\"I thoroughly enjoyed the parts of the book dedicated to climbing and was struck by Whymper's adventurous spirit, and his dedication and perseverance. The book does drag on a bit in a few parts with chapters on the technical details about glaciers and railway tracks. The 130 illustrations, many woodcut by Whymper himself, bring the story to life, and are almost as good as photographs."},{"Title":"Scrambles amongst the Alps","review":"I bought the book due to my interest in the period it covers -- early Alpine mountaineering. Edward Whymper was an interesting guy, and certainly one of the foreign pioneers of mountain climbing (including the first climb of Matterhorn). I found him to be less inspiring as an author -- the book's pace is slow, punctuated by various tangential discussions, e.g. geology of glaciers.It failed to capture my imagination, as other more receint mountaineering books have done -- try Gaston Rebuffat, Walter Bonatti, Chris Bonnington instead."},{"Title":"Scrambles amongst the Alps","review":"Nice read when you like climbing stories but not much to learn from it. Entertaining."},{"Title":"Scrambles amongst the Alps","review":"I found the book non-descriptal and factual. Written in a matter of fact English Literary form classic of that time period from a Chap. His knowledge is plentiful as he pours forth details of every sense on history of regions, region developement, ecology, geology...etc. But the going is very, very slow. It wasn't one of those books I pick up and read through in a matter of days. It took dedication days and I found it a bit depleting at times. I did rather enjoy his dry humor scattered throughout and his detailed outlook regarding natives of those areas of the time. Read if you're into history of mountaineering but have another book on the side to offset the pace."},{"Title":"Lifestream: Journey into Past and Future Lives","review":"Although this book is not long, it has some great info in it.

I can't wait to try them out."},{"Title":"Lifestream: Journey into Past and Future Lives","review":"Take this little book and either read a page or chapter at a time. Or read it all at once.

I picture an encyclopedia about peppers as a comprehensive book with many sections each illustrated with a colorful photo of the subject. That is not the case with this book, however. DeWitt's encyclopedia is yet another cookbook. He included many recipes which he has organized origin not by dish, or type of pepper.For example, \\"A\\" is for Africa and African dishes such as \\"South African Hot Lamb Curry\\" which include American peppers and probably originated with natives from India using British lamb. \\"A\\" contains a section on \`Aji' peppers (of interest to me), but I did not find the Aji pepper I grow in my garden and want to know more about (Aji Colorado). From Africa, we move onto Amazonia, which digresses into African slaves and Catholic saints.DeWitt is obviously quite knowledgeable about peppers.

Nearly twenty years ago, my parents bought me a stack of &quot;notched&quot; sci-fi paperbacks, and this was one of them. It sat around for a while, but eventually one bored Saturday I sifted through the stack and pulled this one out to give it a chance. It was like finding a hidden gem. There's so much adventure, character and creativity packed into a mere 217 pages. Modern writers of fat 1000-page books and never-ending series could learn a lot from Jack Vance. His writing is brisk, clever and most of all colorful and lively. A LOT HAPPENS every few pages! Also, Vance's fiction holds up well over time because he does not rely so much on hard science and the theory of his day, but focuses instead on characters, invented cultures, humor, and the engaging interaction of many personalities. Check this book out, it's an enlightening contrast to just about everything else out there."},{"Title":"Big Planet","review":"This was the first Jack Vance novel I read, thirty or so years ago, and I've been a fan ever since. Vance is one of the great masters, and perhaps had the best use of the language of any SF writer before (at least) Zelazny. I'll always have a fond place in my heart for this one. It probably has more truly intriguing cultures tossed off in a couple of hundred pages than most authors manage in a lifetime, and on top of it all, it is a fun read."},{"Title":"Big Planet","review":"This book, written in the 1950's, shows flashes of the brilliance of the later works of Jack Vance. The use of language (readers new to Vance would be advised to keep a LARGE dictionary by you, or else just let the flow of the language envelope you), the exotic settings, and the realization that the most alien and unknownable creatures that mankind will ever meet, will always be us."},{"Title":"Big Planet","review":"This 1952 sci-fi novel takes place on the aptly named \\"Big Planet\\", a vast untamed world of high diameter and low density, where a lack of heavy metals impedes advanced technology. It has been settled by countless Earth colonies seeking the freedom to pursue their own particular way of life.Earth authorities, concerned about the activities of a local warlord/slaver, send a team to investigate/intervene. However, their ship is sabotaged and crashlands on Big Planet. The survivors, led by Claude Glystra, set out on an impossibly ambitious trek to reach Earth Enclave, located on the other side of the planet, 40,000 miles away. Meanwhile, they continue to worry about the possibility of an enemy agent in their midst.Although I like the idea of \\"Big Planet\\", I don't think Vance puts that idea to its best use here. The overarching warlord/sabotage plot tended to distract from the challenge of the planet itself, and tended to have the effect of making a big planet seem small again. Part of the problem, perhaps, is that Vance's original 1948 manuscript (now lost) was almost twice as long, but edited down after he was told it would not sell. But, for whatever reason, we are left with a rushed adventure story that could just as easily taken place on a small planet.Vance's inventiveness is on display, but he has done better elsewhere. In particular, he has done better with his vastly superior 1975 novel SHOWBOAT WORLD (a/k/a THE MAGIFICENT SHOWBOATS OF THE LOWER VISSEL RIVER, LUNE XIII SOUTH, BIG PLANET), written 23 years later, which is also set on Big Planet. Read that one first - it stands on its own. Read this later, and only if determined to read all things Vance.If you do seek out BIG PLANET, make sure you find an edition that reverts to the 1952 text that appeared in Startling Stories. The 1957 Ace edition, and later editions based on it (such as the 1977 coronet edition), massacred the 1952 text. The 2012 Kindle edition from Spatterlight Press, the Gollancz Kindle edition, 1978 Miller-Underwood edition (but not, as Wikipedia wrongly says, the 1978 Ace edition) and the unobtainable Vance Integral Edition revert to the 1952 text. I'm not sure about the Gollancz paperbacks. One test is whether the opening paragraph refers to Hidders' mixed-race origens and ends with a reference to \\"many brains\\". If so, then read on. If not, and if the second page refers to a \\"Sister of Succor\\" rather than a \\"nun\\", then hold off and wait for a better copy."},{"Title":"Big Planet","review":"Jack Vance's baroque writing style comes-to-the-fore in this astonishing story. The preeminent world building sci/fi adventure writer in generations tantalizes his readers with an imagination of huge scope and originality and brings all of his genius to bare with \\"Big Planet.\\" You will marvel at \\"the monoline\\" and heroic efforts of Glystra the earthman in this amazing action/adventure story...truly brilliant storytelling by a master in the genre...."},{"Title":"DATING GAMES","review":"Ms. Michaels is a fantastic writer. She has this family series that keeps you in stitches. The story moves along at a great pace and the twist at the end is one that I never saw coming. Though I rarely do see them coming in all honesty. She keeps you hoping for the best for the characters even if they are denying it themselves.Rachel keeps all men at a distance. She knows her career could go somewhere and relationships just aren't her thing. She is a sweetheart but knows something is missing. The thing is the secrets in her past keep her locked away. \\"Crash\\" is sick of being fixed up by his family. He longs for his own family but knows that it will come along at the right time. The whole situation he finds himself in isn't how he'd have it happen but he's not about to turn away a gift.Even though this is the last in the series, I loved it so much! I honestly didn't even know it was part of a series so it had no effect on the book itself. It can certainly be read alone and I'd love to get my hands on the rest of the series eventually. Ms. Michaels writes with such emotion that I had to go back and read the ending a second time cause tears were streaming down my face. The majority of the book was light and had me in stitches. It was nice to know that even older, authors still like to write clean simple romances. So much can be experienced in a simple kiss. I will definitely seek more of this author's work out! I think I found a new favorite author."},{"Title":"DATING GAMES","review":"This is a sweet, fun, and clean romance novel that is appropriate for all audiences. Rachel and Colin are two singles who are tired of the meddling matchmakers in their lives, and so Rachel comes up with an idea - they should date each other in order to avoid having to date anyone else! It's a great plan, except that Colin is sweet and funny and very attractive and Rachel begins to wish their fake relationship was real. I gave this book 4 stars instead of 5 because Rachel, much like the usual Michaels' heroine, isn't really a very likable character. But Colin is, and really, isn't that why we read romance novels?"},{"Title":"DATING GAMES","review":"this book is the last of the mckenna series and the first one i read. and i spent almost two years to complete the set on the strength of this book. ms. michaels writes such heartwarming stories, and this one is no exception. this one is about the youngest mckenna brother, colin, and rachel, a heroine a lot like the other mckenna heroines. it's just a pity there isn't more about colin's older brothers here, just the sisters-in-law."},{"Title":"Read Aloud Bible Stories Vol. 1 ; C.

We have recently bought volume two. It took us about a week to show her the difference and convince her that vol 2 had good stories too. Funny thing now is vol 2 is her favorite.

There are occasions where the changes in words seem unnecessary (calling something \\"bad\\" rather than \\"sin\\" for example), or where some additional words would be helpful, but on the whole the product is great.

I have a sensitive 3 year old and was concerned that some bible stories may leave him more afraid than encouraged. I have bought about 5 different toddler/preschool books trying to find a \\"gentle\\" one. This series is it!! She doesn't go into detail about the sins that people do, rather puts it in simple wording which little one's can relate to...like \\"did something bad\\". In the story of Noah, she doesn't go into the sin that brought on the flood or that God wiped out all of the people, she just focusses on how Noah obeyed and how God saved Noah & family from the big storm. I love that! The stories are short enough but engaging for my preschooler. The only negative thing that I can say is that my little one wants me to read one after another which makes the bedtime routine a little longer.

I just may have to get them and find out.Originally I picked up this book for basic Bible stories I could read quickly before bed because there are not many words on each page (parents who read the same book night after night after night know exactly what I'm talking about!), but I thought the illustrations were kind of sloppy.

Lewis Honor Book (Read-Aloud Bible Stories, 1)","review":"In my search for quality Christian books for children, I have been more disapointed than not. Many books out there are heavy handed, poorly illustrated, and often downright boring. Encouragingly, this book succeeds in areas where many fail.The author and illustrator (like Jesus) exhibit a sharp awareness of audience. They resist the urge to cover too much material (a sure way to bore small children) and instead concentrate on telling just five stories well. The first volume includes the story of Zaccheus, the healing of Bartemaeus, Jesus welcoming the little children, the calming of the storm, and the healing of ten men.The text captures the enthusiasm and spirit of each story. Albeit, the word choice can get a bit cutesy at times, but in general the stories are told effectively and in a fashion that makes for good oral reading (as the title claims). At the end of each story, there is a page that briefly summarizes a few of the key points in the story (ie., what the child is supposed to get out of it). Some may find this a bit heavy handed, but I really liked this touch. Repetition is great for children, and it encourages them to reflect on each story and apply it to their lives (modeling good reading skills).The abundance of bold illustrations capture children's attention. Whereas in some children's bible books, the illustrations are predictable and more of an afterthought, in this series, they take center stage. The pictures are vivid and uncomplicated, incorporating strong lines and bold colors. I appreciate the illustrator's ingenuity and variety of perspective.Overall, I think that this series is a great foundation block in any children's library. Good job!"},{"Title":"Read Aloud Bible Stories Vol. 1 ; C. S. Lewis Honor Book (Read-Aloud Bible Stories, 1)","review":"This series is by far the best of the best. The stories and illustrations are fabulous!Children often find the illustrations in other Bible story books scary or weird. While the illustrations are true to the times in terms of dress, they are exaggerated in size, yet simple. For example, Zaccheus, \\"who was to little to reach high things...\\" is shown as a small man in HUGE chair. (p. 6-7)The text is delightful! For example in \\"The Boys and Girls and Jesus,\\" the children come to see Jesus as part of families, i.e. \\"Every day lots of daddies and mommies came to hear Jesus talk. Grandpas and grandmas and friends came, too. Some days - there were too many people to get inside a house.

The illustrations are what make this book so powerful. They take the point of view from a child and are wonderfully colored to enhance the child's imagination. One nice touch is that Jesus' face is never seen. This encourages the imagination and helps to avoid some stereotypical images of Christ that aren't biblical (e.g. Caucasian, blue eyes). This series by Moody Press is the best one that I've seen. The large size of the book makes it perfect for holding up and allowing many children to see the pictures. I have three children and have many books that remain on the shelf. This book is the one most often picked by them over and over again. I highly recommend it"},{"Title":"Read Aloud Bible Stories Vol. 1 ; C. S. Lewis Honor Book (Read-Aloud Bible Stories, 1)","review":"My 2 1/2 year old loves this book and requests it nightly. The language is simple for toddlers to understand, yet is Biblically accurate.The book summarizes the stories at the end and sometimes them a question they can easily apply.

This is not a matter of opinion; it is a fact.The writing and illustration and design collaborate beautifully to communicate with little ones (and big ones). We have read to our son since he was an infant from this book. He is now three and is no less enthralled.The writing distills the essential from the more familiar stories; the illustrations give simple clarity and focus, and a wonderful life of imaginative power to the book."},{"Title":"Read Aloud Bible Stories Vol. 1 ; C.

The illustrations are wonderful and the story selection in each volume is varied and interesting, but not overwhelming. Because of the writing style, the stories are very captivating for little children to hear. The use of pattern and repetion brings the action to life and the word choices are within their range. A friend told me it has been a fabulous resource for her sunday school class. Best of all, when my son began to read, these books proved to be the best and most interesting early readers for him because that same pattern, repetetion and word choice that was great for young listeners is perfect for young readers.

It doesn't spoon-feed you when it comes to giving you instructions, but it works to give you the information you really need to get it done.There are more photos than illustrated diagrams, but they work to show you what needs to be done and how to identify certain components as required. I was disappointed that there were not exploded schematics to show how certain components work, but that would be going further than this book intends, which is to just tear the entire vehicle apart and put it back together.For the home mechanic or \\"do-it-yourselfer\\", this book may or may not meet your needs, depending on your level of experience, but suffice it to say that I have no formal automotive training, aside from driving and I use this relatively comfortably.For the professional mechanic, I would recommend this book, since it would point you in the right direction and provide a wealth of information with regards to stock configurations and settings - and that alone is worth the price of this book.Well done, and a service manual is the first thing I look for when considering a used (or even new) car. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Haynes Dodge & Plymouth Neon 1995 thru 1999 (Haynes Repair Manuals)","review":"As others have stated, the Haynes repair manuals are pretty thorough and an excellent choice for DIY repairs. Having this or a similar manual handy can save you loads of cash at the expense of your own labor. If that is worth it to you, this manual is a good choice.

No, don't even think I did the brakes! Without this manual, we never would have known the adjusting levers for the brakes were not put back on the vehicle. Without these parts on THE BRAKES DON'T WORK. Of course, I told my girlfriend about the brakes, too bad it was her boyfriend that took them off and left them off. Best thing I did was buy this manual, I will always be informed."},{"Title":"Haynes Dodge & Plymouth Neon 1995 thru 1999 (Haynes Repair Manuals)","review":"I've looked through this at a Pep Boys store. The printing job is lousy. The paper is low quality, the print is more gray than black, and the photographs were blurry enough to reduce their usefulness. The instruction for the work I'd wanted to do was simply to have a professional mechanic do it. Still, I'm sure it would be of use for some projects, and if I had more spending money I might have bought it."},{"Title":"The Valkyrie","review":"This Opera Guide 21 (The Valkyrie) is among the finest editions in the excellent series published by English National Opera. While it is absolutely loaded with wonderful gems, my favorite feature (and the reason I HAD to own it) is the side by side presentation of the German text of Wagner's poem with the English translation by Andrew Porter.Porter says, \\"This translation of \\"The Ring\\" was made for singing, acting, and hearing, not for reading.\\" By using (almost always) the same number of syllables in each line of the text as in the German, it is possible to enjoy the German text and the music, while making quick glances at the side-by-side translation. The effect of this translation is powerful. It FITS the music, without being a literal translation, and without the flowery poetic translation in various degrees of free verse that seems typical of the genre. Having listened to about 30 operas in the last six months (most of them multiple times) I feel that this translation enhanced my enjoyment of this opera more than those I used with any of the other operas. The power of the rhythmic translation is amazing.Additionally, there are five pages of leitmotifs presented in the book, which are cross-referenced at the spot where they occur in the text.The several pictures of Brunhilde and her sister Valkyries from early productions (c. 1890-1914)are a hoot!Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Valkyrie","review":"Best translation of this work.

(IncrediBody)","review":"I initially followed Francesco's MuscleNOW program for 12 weeks during the summer of 2001. After reading through the book, which I found fairly easy to understand as well as comprehensive, I was very pleased with my results.Previously, I had tried to piece together tips and advice from various sources to try and develop a diet and weight training program for myself that would provide me with noticeable results. During my research, I found the [...] Web site, and it seemed to be just what I was looking for; a single program that provided guidance on what to eat as well as a weight training program to follow.If you are looking for a one-size-fits-all weight training program, the MuscleNOW program is likely to be exactly what you are looking for. Whether you are looking to slim down or bulk up, Francesco explains how to manage your caloric intake (sounds more difficult that it actually is) so that you can accomplish your goals. In fact, he provides sample diets to make things a bit easier.Beyond the results you will ultimately see after following this program, you will undoubtedly become more knowledgeable about how the body works and the reasoning behind all the guidelines in the book. It is obvious that Francesco put a great deal of time into researching the program to find out what works and what doesn't work. In addition, he provides an e-mail address where you can ask him questions regarding the program. I have personally e-mailed him several times in the past and had received a response within a few days.Overall, I am very happy that I purchased this book!"},{"Title":"MuscleNOW Bodybuilding Program with Lifetime Personal Training: Gain Muscle Mass or Lose Weight (Fat) Without Supplements or Drugs!

Well I hit college and that didn't happen, so I invested in a different kind of textbook: Musclenow! The results I experienced with this program benefited me for the rest of my college years, and changed how I saw diet & exercise forever. There's no excuse after reading this book. ANYONE who follows the principles outlined in musclenow WILL get into the best shape of their lives, as I did. But easily the most valuable aspect of this program is the lifetime e-mail support you receive with it- it's like having a personal trainer who's just an e-mail away. I have to admit- after college life got in the way and I fell off the exercise horse. But years later when I decided to get back into shape, I dusted off my copy of musclenow and read it again. As I was older and my needs were different, I had questions this time. So I e-mailed the author. Low and behold, after YEARS without hearing anything from me, he replied within 24 hours! Not only did he answer all my questions in great detail, he advised me on how to modify the program to suit my personal fitness goals. Priceless. So now I'm getting back on my horse, and with the help of this program I'll be galloping again in no time.

My strength was 175 kg from deadlift , 400 kg from leg press and 5x35 from dips at the end of the program. I look like I was thought I should have looked all my life. Really athletic lean and mean that is. Not skinny and bloated.The book is very simply laid out; do this do that, eat this eat that, avoid these things. The lifting program is quite simple, but very, very demanding. It's smartly laid out so that you will progress every time you do the according the program. I does need a lot of hard work and a lot of effort. I'm not kidding. Then it's the diet part. When I saw the raw numbers, of how much you should eat, I was like \\"you got to be kidding, that'll get me very fat very quickly\\". I followed it to the T nevertheless. I did the punishing workouts, did the cardio and ate what the program said. At first three weeks, I didn't notice much of a difference. I was getting bigger, but not that much. All my workmates recommended me to quit, they said that amount of food you're eating, will get you fat. But then something changed. I was actually growing week after week, while my waist stayed the same. Some weeks the growth was minimal, sometimes it took huge leaps forward. This happened especially after 8 weeks of solid training. My workmates actually started accusing me of steroid usage, because I was growing so quickly in a such a short time.MuscleNOW Bodybuilding Program with Unlimited Lifetime Personal Training from the Author - Learn How to Build Muscle and Lose Weight (Fat) Without Supplements and Drugs!

After the first 3 1/2 months I was spent. It took a few more months before I was ready to give 100% again. In the meantime I was able to give about 75% effort. I measure effort in terms of intensity when lifting to failure on the safe to do sets. ie.. I have a smith machine with safety bars and can go all out while working alone. I would never go to failure without a trusted spotter or the right equipment. The MuscleNow website looks too good to be true- a real gimmicky looking page of before and after photo's of real people. The price is steep but nothing compared to the cash spent on fitness/muscle supplements. Worth the cost and then some for a dramatically changed body. I have tried about 5 other internet programs. Some have been good but none compare to the simplcity of the MuscleNow book.

(IncrediBody)","review":"So you've gotten over the sticker shock,wondered what's inside the book, then decided to go further to read some reviews. Well hopefully I can help you out.The first thing to understand is that you are not purchasing a book per se. You are purchasing a resource. Along with the book you are also subscribing to Francesco's bodybuilding knowledge for life. Francesco will stay with you throughout your bodybuilding career (bodybuilder doesn't only apply to musclebound freaks) and guide you. He will answer any questions and also help you tailor the program to help you maximize your results.Second you should understand what the book is NOT. This is not a fad book. Francesco does not preach get thin quick or become musclebound over night with shakes,powders, and crappy gizmos. It's all about making a commitment to yourself and having the discipline to make a plan, then follow it through. It's not about eating mcdonalds and carrying a six pack of abs. You'll have to actually work at it to get the body you want.Third you need to know what the book is. It is a blueprint. It will teach you what you need to know in order to set your weight loss or muscle building goals. He will teach you about eating, what exercises to do, and when to do them. You'll also learn about the most overlooked aspect of weight loss and body building which is recovery. You'll get all the elements food,exercise, and recovery, and how to use them to accomplish whatever goals you set out for yourself.I purchased this book 7 years ago and Francesco is still answering my questions. You can spend a lot of years and way more money on get thin quick programs and still miss a lot of what's in this book. Its a shortcut without all the frustration.If you have any questions you can email me at migalfonseca@gmail.com."},{"Title":"MuscleNOW Bodybuilding Program with Lifetime Personal Training: Gain Muscle Mass or Lose Weight (Fat) Without Supplements or Drugs!

(IncrediBody)","review":"Francesco's program is exceptional for natural bodybuilders, both experienced and inexperienced, who wish to create a winning physique while not sacrificing their health. This program covers both nutrition and weightlifting. Both elements are critical to success. Several distinct weight lifting programs are covered. The most intense program might consume 5 hours or so a week and is fairly rigorous. The least intense program only requires a few hours a week. This is perfect for a busy person. I am following the least intense program and find it easy to stick with while producing excellent gains (I am 46). One refreshing aspect is that this is NOT a drug or supplement pushing book. Supplements are relatively easy to market, profit markups are huge, and the bottom line is that they do very little compared to proper basic nutrition, meal timing, and proper weightlifting.

Period. 2-The cyclical nature of the program avoids plateauing by keeping you \\"above the plateau\\" line, and below the overtraing line. So if you're in the middle, you're gaining muscle.This book ALSO addresses fat loss WithOUT losing (and still GAINING) muscle while getting ripped...and it's NOT another Adkins/ketogenic diet!This is one of the most researched and LOGICAL programs out there. The program is based on the Bulgarian Burst Strength Training system (Big Beyond Belief), but this book meticulously addresses diet, as the BBB book doesn't do it completely.If you're a natural bodybuilder, this is the book for you."},{"Title":"MuscleNOW Bodybuilding Program with Lifetime Personal Training: Gain Muscle Mass or Lose Weight (Fat) Without Supplements or Drugs!

Then, when you think you know where things are going, a sharp turn and you \\"gasp\\" at the added excitment. You will not want to put it down!!"},{"Title":"Some Things I Never Thought Id Do","review":"Pearl Cleage has written another gem of a novel. Before I read \\"Some Things I Never Thought I'd Do\\" I accidentally read \\"Baby Brother's Blues\\" first, not realizing it was a sequel. So I already knew Regina, Blue, Precious Hargrove, Aretha, Kwame, and Brandi. And they're all characters I like and can root for. Opening this novel was still like entering a world I'd love to live in forever. The characters and descriptions are rich, and the plot kept me turning the pages. Regina is an every-woman main character. As I read about her attempts to overcome past mistakes and her present challenges with work and her relationships, she feels like she could be someone I knew. She feels like she could be me, in fact. The only thing thing that bothered me about Regina is that she drank a lot of alcohol for a recovering drug addict. I'm familiar with the paths of recovery, and alcohol is a no-no. Yes, it's legal, but for the substance abuser, it's just another illicit drug. That aside, I loved everything else about the novel. The plot wasn't as tight or complex as the sequel, and the sequel is slightly better written. But this novel deserves a place on the shelf of great American literature. NOt just African-American literature. But literature, period."},{"Title":"Some Things I Never Thought Id Do","review":"I was in the public library looking for another book when I happened to walk past this one. It seemed interesting so I checked it out. Let me tell you, if I hadn't started school a few days before I would have read this in one night. It was so well written. I found myself immersed in the lives of the characters. I was so happy when Blue made DoDo and King James disappear. I started wishing that I lived in Blue's neighborhood. The romance between him and the main character was so engrossing. I found myself wishing they'd hurry the hell up and get together. Beth's final performance on meeting the grandbaby she had denied existed for so long was maddening. I wanted to punch her in her throat for being such an [...]. It's a great read. I highly recommend you purchase your own copy just as I plan to do."},{"Title":"Some Things I Never Thought Id Do","review":"Pearl Cleage is an excellent story teller.. Her stories interwine characters from her other published works; allowing you to envision the the story lines."},{"Title":"Some Things I Never Thought Id Do","review":"A buddy of mine suggested that I read this book because she and I were talking about different types of guys we'd date, and she said how much she felt like she needed a man like Blue. Curiosity got the better of me, so I picked up this book, and I definitely see why she had a literary crush on this main male character. The story is about a past drug addict named Regina who has gotten her life together, gone to rehab, and is now trying to get over her ex by doing something constructive and that she enjoys: speech writing for an old friend/now enemy Beth. Considering she and Beth don't see eye to eye but she needs the money, this is a little awkward for her, and the situation gets even more uncomfortable when she is hired to go through her ex's things after he passes to make sure there is nothing to harm his reputation, courtesy of Beth (her ex's mother). She has to find a new living space, and she moves into an area of Atlanta where there is no crime, no rapes, and women (and men) can walk safely around. Yeah, sounds a little suspect, right? Well, a mysterious man named Blue is in charge of making sure the neighborhood is safe. In addition to trying to get over her untrusting views on men, her beef with Beth, and her drug habit, she's on a mission to find out how is Blue managing to keep the neighborhood safe. But in the middle of all this snooping, writing, and living, she finds out her aunt's prediction about a past life may just be on the money.Cons: The whole idea of reincarnation is always a stretch for me. I can't say I don't believe it, but I can't say I do, and once the conversation went into emperors, kings, and queens, my eyes started clouding over. That chapter was too far-fetched for me to get into.I also found that extremely important conversations were glossed over when I really wanted to read them (ex. Regina knowing so much about Peachy's wife but there was never a conversation with Peachy about it nor did it seem realistic that Blue would tell her this stuff seeing as how he barely knew her in this life himself; Regina confiding in Blue about her drug addiction; no face-to-face contact with the king EVER). I got the feeling that the author wanted us to stay focused on the relationship between Blue and Regina and not get distracted by the political/social issues in the town, at least not the ones that didn't concern Beth or her son.Pros: I loved every single thing about Blue--charismatic as he wanted to be. I could imagine how he looked, smelled, talked, walked, and I thought he was one great character. I liked Regina's down-to-Earth personality, and the conversation between the two, as well as all others, was realistic. The author made me do some research on some oldies when Peachy and Blue sang at the beach because I'd never heard \\"The Party\\" before. But what really got me about this story were the underlying themes written in conversation.My favorite quote:\\"You know what's funny about black women?\\" Blue asked gently.\\"What's that?\\"\\"They're the only women in the world that you have to talk into letting you protect them.\\"Those lines sparked some interesting conversation with a co-worker, and I ended up blogging on that topic. This was a really good read, and I enjoyed it. I'll definitely have to check out some more work from her."},{"Title":"Some Things I Never Thought Id Do","review":"This book was bought for me to have something to read for the long trip from Connecticut to North and South Carolina for my summer vacation.You will not be disappointed by anything Pearl Cleage writes. Get this book and all the books she has available."},{"Title":"Some Things I Never Thought Id Do","review":"I was struck by how Ms. Cleage painted a picture of Atlanta that was so much better than the actual city. Since she lives in Atlanta, she might disagree. However, that just made me love the story more as I'm a local myself and have walked the neighborhoods she writes about (without any fear either). It's a fairy tale with lots of heart.As a melanin deficient American, and male to boot, I was also enraptured with how Regina's story just sucked me in. I felt what she was going through on a level that few stories have managed to get me too.I'd recommend this to anyone who wants to be able to cheer for their shero. Regina and Ms. Cleage are both mine now. She even had me wishing Blue was real and protecting the city and that Precious could really run for Governor and that I could purchase food from the West End growers association.Didn't know until I got to the end that this book had a part 2, but I'm hooked now so I'm gonna have to get it."},{"Title":"Some Things I Never Thought Id Do","review":"Fairy tales are easy to recognize. They usually begin with the phrase \\"once upon a time\\" or \\"in ages long ago,\\" have a beautiful,\\" in-need-of-rescue\\" heroine and a hero able to perform feats of magic while dislodging demons. Atlanta writer Pearl Cleage's latest novel Some Things I Never Thought I'd Do has none of these markers, but nevertheless, it is a fairy tale.The first clue that the book is a fairy tale is Cleage's 30ish, single, black \\"in-need-of-rescue\\" heroine, Regina Burns. Like her counterparts in fairy tale fiction, Regina Burns has a serious problem. In her case, her problem is not caused by two evil stepsisters and an equally evil step-mother. Her problem is a bit more modern. She is a recovering cocaine addict, who blames her drug addiction on the hard-to-handle way her last love affair ended. When the novel begins, with no job or other resources, she has to find a way to repay the bank the $30,000 she borrowed while an addict against the house \\"where she and her mother were born\\" before the bank sells it.In fairy-tale worlds, heroines have fairy godmother who, with the wave of a wand, can transform pumpkins into carriages, mice into footmen, and hand-me-down clothes into fabulous, one of a kind, Neiman-Marcus gowns. With no parents, no job, no support system-just a house that she expects to find \\"padlocked, with an overgrown yard and \`a FOR SALE sign sticking up in the middle'- fresh from rehab, Regina needs that breed of godmother. In Aunt Abbie, Regina's father's third sister with whom Regina has had no contact since her parents' funeral, who somehow knows that Regina is in rehab and the exact day on which she will be released, Cleage creates one for her. Though Cleage gives this character no wand, she does give her extraordinary powers. Not only is Aunt Abbie able to transform Regina's house into a \\"generally spiffed up, freshly painted house with neatly trimmed grass,\\" but in true god-mother style, she knows that Regina must take the job she has been offered in Atlanta so that she can meet a man there with \\"blue eyes\\" who has been looking for her across time, and release a \\"damsel in distress from a dragon.\\" And, despite being nearly penniless herself (this is a modern fairy tale, after all!), knowing that Regina hates planes, she is also able to vanquish that worry as well with expensive sleeper accommodations to Atlanta on Amtrak.In Atlanta, the fairy tale continues. Prince Charming is recast as \\"Blue Hamilton,\\" a three-time married man with turquoise-blue eyes who looks like \\"a painting of an African warrior king,\\" and who, in true-fairy tale fashion, not only has no problems from three marriages (wives, children) that will complicate his entering into a new relationship, but rents rooms in the house where he lives to two young, attractive single women, Aretha and Flora, who are as kind and helpful to Regina as they are uninterested in Blue as a potential mate!And what an attractive potential mate he is! Prince Charming \`s lifestyle is bland pudding compared to his. He owns not just one house, but two-- the house where he lives and a second home, a large beachfront house on an island--two cars, one of which is a limousine, is industrious, gives huge $100 tips, and is able to make the neighborhood where he lives, his kingdom, West End, one of the most crime-ridden neighborhoods in Atlanta, so safe that men do not even whistle at attractive women who walk past them.When Cinderella gets her prince, the story ends and she has nothing left to do but go off to do whatever poor girls who manage to wed princes do. However, true to her 21st century pedigree, once Cleage's Cinderella (Regina Burns) lands her prince, her story is not over. She mutates from a woman in search of a prince into her male counterpart in fairy tales: a heroic figure able to easily complete impossible tasks. And the task she has would castrate even the most fearless fairy-tale hero! Regina's employer, the renown public figure, Beth Davis, wants Regina to orchestrate a ceremony honoring her son, who died in the 9-11 tragedy, with a building named for him at his alma mater, Morehouse. And, she wants Regina to do this without tarnishing his image by revealing that her much-respected son had a child with a stripper (of all people!) out of wedlock. That Regina is able to publicly disclose the son's secret life with a stripper and introduce their illegitimate child at the ceremony honoring the son without alienating her employer or losing the salary that she owes to her banker is final proof that Cleage's novel is a fairy tale. Where else but in a fairy tale could an audience love a public figure who pretends to live a life worthy of emulation when all the time he has had a relationship and a child with a woman who shows her body to others for a living. Where else but in a fairy tale could such a travesty end happily? Where but in a fairy tale could Cleage end her novel with her book's heroine leaving Atlanta ( read: \\"riding off into the sunset\\") for her NY hometown and her aunt Abbie with both her prince Charming and the money she needs to free her ancestral home from her weasel banker?When comparing Cleage to Toni Morrison, Maya Angelou, and Terri McMillan, three black writers who share her audience, we can say that Toni Morrison's novels reveal a mastery of theme; Maya Angelou's of style; Terri McMillan's of plot. Although exactly what Cleage masters in her newest novel is subject to debate, what cannot be debated is that in it she does something I never thought she'd do- reduce the perennial struggle of black women for a suitable mate and a safe home to a fairy tale."},{"Title":"Some Things I Never Thought Id Do","review":"Ok, I've read Cleage's other books and I was not expecting this one to be any different. It is. First off I don't understand her throwing in the past life of Blue and I really wanted to know more about him and Regina who is a recovering cocaine addict.(not crack...there is a difference really?)Anyway, although the story was interesting, strange I kept waiting for it to get better. I'm still waiting. This is not one of her best."},{"Title":"Some Things I Never Thought Id Do","review":"The first chapter is a real attention grabber and on the whole the plot is good, smudged a bit when the author takes the reader down a path of past lives and supernatural issues and the ocean blue eyes of Blue Hamilton. Too bad becasue her story about living in a safe, secure neighbourhood where a woman doesn't have to \\"notice a man coming up behind her and it's okay\\" (pg 282) is right on.The author excelled in the many nuances throughout the story. On page 23 I found this African proverb very interesting. \\"The hunter is always the good guy until the story is told by the lion.\\" Then on page 193 the author criticizes a pop culture \\"in which manhood is defined by cars and clothes and random sex and money made by any means necessary\\" rather than being tied to family and community by \\"ribbons of love and protection and responsibility and caring.\\" Excellently put and I agree with her wholeheartedly."},{"Title":"Some Things I Never Thought Id Do","review":"This was my first Cleage Novel and I was pleasently pleased. I found her writing creative and quite artistic. While it's a bit of a fantacy novel toward the end, it didn't take away from the real world issues and characters. This was not your typical romance, but a romance with a purpose and that much better."},{"Title":"Some Things I Never Thought Id Do","review":"After reading the Oprah Pick, \\"What Looks Like Crazy on an Ordinary Day, I was very disappointed in \\"Some Things I Never Thought I'd Do.\\" It took me two long weeks to finish this slim novel and I lost interest after about the first fifty pages. I don't think Pearl Cleage is a paticularly talented novelist; I think she can write realistic,sometimes dynamic dialogue between her black characters, but the story is lacking.I loved the very first part of the book where Regina Burns has just gotten out of rehab, is losing her anscestral home, so she goes to her aunt Abbie for help and comfort and Abbie introduces Regina to the notion that life is not a lost cause--that is the story I wanted to read. Instead, what I got is a very political story infused with the author's belief that black men especially need positive role models. I believe we ALL need to be and have positive role models, that it is not just a black thing.I wanted to read more about Regina and Blue. I felt as if that part of the story was horribly under developed. I hope that Pearl Cleage's next novel is better than this one, but I'm sorry to say I don't hold out much hope."},{"Title":"Some Things I Never Thought Id Do","review":"I am a huge fan of Pearl Cleage's books. I really loved this latest tale;however, I had a problem with the way Regina's drug habit is presented. Quite frankly, I find it unbelievable that she could have a nasty enough cocaine addiction that she would loose her house and most of her belongings, yet be so &quot;recovered&quot; that she could dring cognac, champagne, and get a &quot;buzz&quot; on. Since when is this appropriate behavior for a recovering addict? Also, there is nothing in the story about Regina's journey to stay off of drugs and her rehab. She doesn't go to any Narcotics Anonymous meetings, doesn't check in with any counselors, etc. Sorry, but this all seems a bit unbelievable. Other than that, this is a terrific book and I can't wait for the next!"},{"Title":"Some Things I Never Thought Id Do","review":"SOME THINGS I NEVER THOUGHT I'D DO is a riveting modern-day fairy tale. Cleage challenges readers to imagine what life could be like if we all took charge of our lives and our communities. In many ways this is a work of speculative fiction-- a novel that asks \\"What if?\\"What if we protected our children from predators? What if we harnessed our political and economic power to change our reality? What if brothers and sisters could come together to make love and make change and make peace?This is a love story, a romance. But like all of Cleage's stories, there is powerful message intermingled with the sweetness."},{"Title":"Some Things I Never Thought Id Do","review":"I read this book after it was recommended to me and I came with high expectations, maybe too high. While I respect the writer as a sucessful author I was quite disappointed with this book. It was not the type of writing and storyline I expected. The book forced me to ask myself if I was starved for more drama or could a simple, fairy-tale story satisfy my thirst? I did want to see more. When I noticed that I was getting very close to the end and nothing happened yet, not even a sex scene, I was wanting something to explode, some gun to go off, something to put me on the edge of my seat and cause me to escape, SOMETHING! I found myself skipping over pages while reading because I was uninterested in conversations, hoping to get to something, something that would drive me and make me say, \\"I didn't see that coming!\\" But that didn't happen. Everything was predicable to the very end. And the end was just that, the end, as one reviewer wrote, \\"The ride off into the sunset\\" toward D.C and while I wanted very much to feel good and say \\"Ah, wasn't that sweet?\\" it wasn't the heart candy that I believe the author was trying to give us. It fell very very short of that. The past life time storyline was just too ill-developed and not at all believeable even if I am one that believes in such possibilities. I would have loved to have seen that developed more! With that said, I am very sure I will read another book by this author because I know she is an excellent writer. I will give her another try. She's proven herself, but this book just didn't do it for me."},{"Title":"Some Things I Never Thought Id Do","review":"Have you ever read a book that made you feel you were sampling a sinfully delicious dessert? This is exactly how the newest addition to the genre of contemporary African-American fiction by Pearl Cleage felt like. We meet our protagonist Regina Hall, freshly recovering from the downward spiral of cocaine addiction following a love gone wrong. Needing to repair burnt bridges (and to save her family home from foreclosure) she reluctantly journeys to Atlanta to amass some badly-needed capital via a consultancy extended to her from her former boss Beth Davis. Armed with little more than wild speculation on what awaited her there (courtesy of her &quot;visionary&quot; post-menopausal Aunt Abbie), she encounters new truths about the man who left her life and stumbles upon a new mysterious gentleman &quot;who has the ocean in his eyes&quot; that coincidentally has an eerie resemblance to the man Aunt Abbie described in her vision...Like her past best-selling efforts, &quot;What Looks Like Crazy on An Ordinary day&quot; and &quot;I Wish I Had a Red Dress,&quot; Cleage infuses her narrative with an intimacy and appealing eclecticism among her characters that makes them interesting and ultimately effective dispensers of truth. Themes familiar in her other works such as the Black man as protector (and the Black woman's response within this paradigm), the idea of creating a safe haven in communities of color and the notion of self-renewal as a prerequisite to community revitalization are deftly interwoven into the fabric of this work without being preachy or self-righteous.This is truly a story I did not want to end. It gently illustrates what can happen when we remain open to gracefully accepting what we've asked the universe for-regardless of the actual packaging it shows up in. As readers and witnesses to this phenomenon in the experience of our protagonist, we are nourished, strengthened and that more receptive to the gifts that make their way into our lives through the most unlikely of channels.Idara E.

Narrator Regina Burns is warned by her aunt that there is someone in ATL, an attractive man with 'the ocean in his eyes', so when eventually Regina meets him, she knows exactly who he is, or does she? Regina's encounters with this man, and with her new neighbors who are passionate about life and their surrounding community, changes her life and help to open up her heart. She is both brave and timid, sometimes releasing herself to accept what she feels deep inside so she can grasp the new and precious things that life has to offer. Pearl Cleage's writing sings in this refreshing and vivid novel, and her mastery of language is admirable. Cleage takes all manner of words, and connects them together like a fine piece of tapestry to create a moving and enriching story. Your social sensibilities might be stirred, and you may even find a little romance in this highly recommended novel that celebrates humanistic strength and integrity."},{"Title":"Some Things I Never Thought Id Do","review":"Ms. Cleage does it again and again.

I think everyone will agree that WE KNEW Regina would find BLUE...after all, back in the day....and even now, when our elders tell us something is going to happen...you can run to the bank with it!

I was going to write it off as melodramatic; a writer writing about what she wishes were true rather than what is. Then it occurred to me that I was railing against this story because Dan Rather, Tom Brokaw and Peter Jennings won't let me believe that Black Men like the character Blue really do exist. I am still fighting the conditioning and the subliminal messages of the dominant culture that tell me, &quot;Brothers ain't no good.&quot;We don't see them, and maybe that is the intent (to not be seen), but there are Black Men who believe in taking care of and taking charge of their communities. Ms. Cleage presents this story easily and mystically with a backdrop of reincarnation thrown in. It works. It works beautifully. My spirit and belief in Black Men has been ignited even further. The only criticism I have is that we didn't see more of the main character's struggle with sobriety.Wonderful, magical and empowering novel."},{"Title":"Some Things I Never Thought Id Do","review":"Pearl Cleage returns to the literary scene with her much anticipated novel SOME THINGS I NEVER THOUGHT I'D DO. In the story, Regina Burns, fresh out of rehab and skating on thin ice with her mortgage company, agrees to work on a project for her former employer Beth Davis. Also the mother of Regina's lost love of a lifetime, Beth is a motivational speaker for single mothers who strives to inspire and lift them up. However, while her orations are uplifting, Beth's personal relationships leave much to be desired.Guided by her Aunt Abbie's post-menopausal extrasensory visions, Regina heads from DC to Atlanta to pay both tribute to Beth's son and payments to her banker. In Atlanta she meets Blue Hamilton, a black man with eyes the color of the sea. He owns the building where she decides to board, and as she learns, she has known him before in a less traditional sense. Once Regina gets to work she finds that her aunt's visions are much more than the ramblings of an old woman and that her task is much larger than saving the house where she was raised.Pearl Cleage is one of those great storytellers that knows how to work virtually any situation. I was enraptured with this book, and each page added a litany of emotions to my soul. The primary characters are spectacular, but the other characters she included are just as real, and they each add an important piece to the story.

He is strong, intelligent, sexy, but most of all, determined to protect his woman and all of the women around him. Once again, Pearl Cleage gifts her reader's with a strong, electrifying black male character. He is Prince Charming wrapped up in nubian wrapping paper.The story flows and moves with a fluidity that is only surpassed by the strong dialogue and the extremely believable characters. Even though Blue and other males in the book represent what many of us would like to see among our \\"menfolk\\" Cleage leaves hope for the reader that this doesn't have to be fiction. She leaves the door open for her readers to believe that real men do exist and are just waiting to be the men that they can be.

So, while I have enjoyed Cleage's earlier work, I felt a bit hesitant in purchasing this book. However, I can unwaveringly say that she did not let me down. Consistent with her other books, Cleage weaves a story filled with bold characters who seem so familiar to you. Strong role models, comforting sista friends, upstanding men, fearless women, etc. Not only can you envision yourself as part of the community that Cleage describes, but you desire to be in it - which makes the book an enjoyable and easy read. At times, the story gets a bit hokey with Cleage's touches of mysticism and reincarnation. However, she keeps it as an undercurrent to the story, which allows those of us who are not big fans of the esoteric to ignore it and enjoy the reality of the story line. Although the ending is a bit anti-climatic (or less-than dramatic), it is honest and redeeming.

As a Pearl Cleage fan, I purchased the book sight unseen and could not have been more pleased. It restored my belief in true black love community and sisterhood. An endearing read, I couldn't put the book down. Cleage's innate storytelling ability makes all the characters come to life and your eager to find out how they work it out. My only disappointment was finishing the book."},{"Title":"Some Things I Never Thought Id Do","review":"Is the enjoyment of a book lessened if you know from the start how it will end? In the case of SOME THINGS I NEVER THOUGHT I'D DO, the answer is no.Right from the start of the book Regina Burns knows her fate, as told to her by her visionary advisor, her Aunt Abbie. A recovering drug addict, Regina has lost her job, her love, and is close to losing the home that belonged to her mother and her mother's mother. But her &quot;vibrant, self-sufficient, patchouli-smelling&quot; Aunt Abbie predicts ... no, she knows that all will be well. &quot;There's a man in Atlanta who's been looking for you across time,&quot; she tells Regina. Voices are telling Aunt Abbie that her niece will travel to Atlanta to &quot;complete a task for a fallen friend&quot; and &quot;rescue a damsel in distress.&quot;It's heady stuff for sure, but Regina takes it in stride as she heads off to Atlanta to work for the one person who would hire her: her former boss Beth Davis, a motivational speaker and the mother of her former fianc&eacute;. She's not keen on working for the woman who contributed to the demise of her relationship, but it's work and it'll save her mother's house. Beth has employed her to archive her deceased son's papers and work on a memorial to him ... to &quot;complete a task for a fallen friend.&quot;Once in Atlanta she finds a neighborhood that verges on too-good-to-be-true. There's no crime, the streets are clean and bright, and the neighbors are all friendly. One man --- Blue --- gets all the credit for the town's charm and it turns out he also gets Regina's heart. Eyes the color of the vast ocean, Blue has indeed been looking for Regina and the spark is instantaneous.The &quot;damsel in distress&quot; will reveal herself soon enough, so I won't spoil that for you. I will say though that this is a magical story. Passionate and engaging, Regina is a lovable character for whom you can't help but root. You may know from the start what awaits Regina, but the lovely unfolding of the story will keep you reading until the damsel is saved and all in Regina's world is what Aunt Abbie knew it would be.--- Reviewed by Roberta O'Hara"},{"Title":"Some Things I Never Thought Id Do","review":"Once again Pearl does her thing.

I won't spoil the book with too many details, but I guarantee, you will not be disappointed. This book makes you look at your self and shake your head, at some of the things you thought you'd never do. In the year 2030, this will still be a great read. Pearl Cleage, take your seat at the table of literary masters."},{"Title":"Some Things I Never Thought Id Do","review":"The best part of the book are all the references in it to Atlanta places and the West End. It was fun to read about all the places in and around the West End, if you grew up in the ATL. The book overall was a bit disappointing. Not what I thought it would be as I read through chapter after chapter. The ending was okay, but left you feeling a bit &quot;flat&quot; and did not end as I expected. This was not what I expected for a Peal C book."},{"Title":"Some Things I Never Thought Id Do","review":"Big Cleage fan, but this one didn't &quot;hold me hostage&quot; like the others. I kept waiting for something to happen, but by the end of of the book, it was pretty boring. It was almost fairy-tale-ish with the visionary aunt (fairy godmother), then everything falling so neatly into place with the whole Blue Hamilton thing. I guess I can assume that he &quot;knocked off&quot; anyone who didn't &quot;act right&quot; within the bounds of his territory. Still kinda lost @ how the whole &quot;he's been searching for you across time&quot; thing works, but maybe it was just me."},{"Title":"Some Things I Never Thought Id Do","review":"I had a chance to listen to Cleage's novel as an audio book, so I was a bit of a captive audience. The Morehouse Man in me enjoyed experiencing a story set in West End Atlanta and listening to travelog descriptions of stores and land marks that I remembered. The setting does become a kind of character in and of itself and provides a short hand method of characterization for Cleage, in that characters that are educated and community minded reside in West End, while those characters that deal in flesh and violence and pain inhabit Stewart Ave.I like the social consciousness of the book. R&B; singer and enforcer of Black manhood Blue Hamilton creates a West End where women can walk securely after dark and pimps, pushers, and abusers are afraid to transgress. Cleage's characters are aware of their culture and communal obligations as Black people. Her West End is a kind of Duboisian Black Utopia in which the Talented Tenth actually share the fruits of success.At the same time, it's hard to mix social consciousness, prophetic dreams, and romance. In Cleage's book the three don't exactly blend well. In truth, the book isn't all that romantic. Now, I'll confess that's fine with me, as I'm not a fan of romance stories posing as literature anyway. Black sections in bookstores are already overfilled with disposable gossip novels. Cleage promises a romance story, but the prophecies and predestination create a build up that the actual courtship of Regina and Blue doesn't live up to. Their relationship seems too easy and sudden, even taking into account past lives and reincarnation.I think Cleage finds herself in an awkward position as a writer. As a Spelman College professor and the daughter of the founder of a Black Revolutionary Christian church, the Shrine of the Black Madonna, Pearl Cleage has serious motivations and a desire to make her readers, especially her Black readers, think. But she's limited by the confines of the romance genre, which usually seeks more heartbeats than revolutionary heroism.Pearl Cleage's more serious aims might better fit more serious literature."},{"Title":"Some Things I Never Thought Id Do","review":"Pearl Cleage's latest novel, Some Things I Never Thought I'd Do is a tale of recovery, redemption, and a love that transcends time. Regina Burns, a talented speechwriter, is fresh out of a Washington, DC rehabilitation center and ready to begin her life anew. She has rebounded from cocaine addiction propelled during a period of depression after breaking up with her fianc&eacute; and having her habit fueled by her inheritance from her recently deceased parents. Desperate for money, she embraces responsibility and reluctantly accepts a short-term job in Atlanta with her \\"would-have-been\\" mother-in-law (who was really the cause of the break-up) to save her family's home from foreclosure. If this sounds like a challenge, it is; however add in her visionary aunt's premonition regarding Regina's destiny to save a damsel in distress, slay a dragon, and meet a handsome man with \\"the ocean in his eyes\\" and the level of complexity, suspense, and drama goes through the roof!This novel is in sync with Cleage's other works, in that she exposes human nature to the bare bones - she skilfully wraps issues surrounding love, class, sexuality, and race into a wonderful story. Her characters are warm and likeable; her sense of humor is witty and perfectly timed; and her pacing is great. It is a delightful \\"feel good\\" novel in that in the end the prophesy is fulfilled, cosmic justice is served, and a message on doing the right thing is delivered. This is a wonderful summertime read!Reviewed by PhyllisAPOOO BookClub"},{"Title":"Some Things I Never Thought Id Do","review":"I have read and enjoyed several books by Ms Cleage. This book is also well written, with realistic dialogue and lots of clever observations.I was saddened, however, by the fact that the only white people who appeared in the book are villains. For instance, Ms Cleage dubs the mortgage banker who cuts Gina a break and lets her -- after months of crack-junky irresponsibility and non-payments -- have another chance to save her home \\"the weasel.\\" The only other white people mentioned in the book are the saccharine, cookie-cutter Republicans trying to corrupt Beth. I'm certainly no fan of the GOP and its treatment of Black Americans, either, but Ms Cleage's treatment of white Americans (or Asian, or European or any other kind of people) in the book was really strange. In this respect, the book reminds me of the \\"feminist utopian\\" novels written by lesbians a few years ago - books depicting an \\"ideal world\\" -- with no men.I was also disappointed with the one-dimensional character of the former emperor Blue. Ok, we get it - he's hot and he's strong and he protects his own, but there's no depth to him. The whole emperor story is bizarre, too - it's briefly mentioned but there's no story there.Pearl Cleage is capable of so much more. I was disappointed with this book but since her writing is still interesting, even when the plot is not well developed, I gave it four stars."},{"Title":"Some Things I Never Thought Id Do","review":"I would strongly recommend this book to other aspiring writers. The writing is excellent and although I found myself questioning Regina's troubled past, the story was written well enough for me to keep reading. I read it in a matter of days and wouldn't hesitate to read one of Mrs. Cleage's other novels."},{"Title":"Some Things I Never Thought Id Do","review":"This book is not what i thought it would be. The story of a recovering drug addict trying to start over was a good start, but her story just took a wrong turn, or didnt know where to turn. The storyline was all over the place. Ms Cleage didnt seem to know which direction she wanted take the book. And there were a couple of unanswered questions that would have made the book interesting.1. What was the \\"coming from a past life\\" story about?What did that have to do with the main story. She just dropped that in there for shock value and didnt develop it. And that was the most compelling part of the book. The whole concept had no place in this book, it just seemed out of place. Unless she plans to write a sequal continuing that part of the story.2. What happened between the main character and here ex boyfriend that drove her to become a crack head? This part of the story is left to our imaginations.There are other things that just dont add up. It took me a week to finish this, which is unusual for a Pearl Cleage book.Maybe Babylon sisters will be better."},{"Title":"Some Things I Never Thought Id Do","review":"It's hard to write this review since I love Pearl Cleage's style of writing and her book called, &quot;What Looks Like Crazy On An Ordinary Day.&quot; I read &quot;Some Things I Never Thought I'd Do&quot; cover to cover. The whole time I kept hoping something really exciting would happen, afterall, it's a novel right? Well, it never did! It never quite climaxed! The strength of this book was in how honestly she spoke of the dreams and problems between black women and men. The idea of Blue Hamilton was wonderfully imaginative. (Oh how I wish there were real Blue Hamilton's in &quot;Our World&quot;) I love how she wrapped this hidden wish into the fictional pages of this novel. It's always priceless to me, to read a book where the authors speaks of the physical, emotional and spiritual beauty and complexity of &quot;Black&quot; people. Ms. Cleage is a wonderful writer but I couldn't get excited about the plot. It was like reading the diary of this one, kinda eccentric, woman's life. Overall, I have mixed feelings which explains my &quot;4-star&quot; rating. At one point the characters are connected on this rather odd belief which either should have been developed more or left out completely. Of course, the inside flap tells us that this is a book about sisterhood (true!), unexpected love (that part was cute!), and just a little magic (hold up, that's where it got WEIRD!). But, if you like Ms. Cleage's unique way of pulling us in with ordinary, at times, humorous, lives of &quot;sistahs&quot;, you'll enjoy this book. It was interesting enough to finish reading, so have your go at it. Afterall, we're all entitled to our opinion!"},{"Title":"Some Things I Never Thought Id Do","review":"A true Pearl Cleage fan has waited, and now another good one hasarrived. I must say that the title really grabbed me. For a minute I wondered if Ms. Cleage wasn't going into the realm of some lame contemporary African-American literature. How could I doubt her? She has pulled off another good book. First let me do a little critical observation. Ms. Cleage definitely has something to say here.If anything I think she is telling the African-American community to wake up and do more to save ourselves. Through the community in this book, Ms. Cleage gives us hope and inspiration of what our communities could be (and possibly what they once were). In this book strong black men have a place and that place is right beside the black women and children that they love. The magical aspects of this book appeal to our African past and sensibilities.I often wondered if Ms.Cleage wasn't suggesting that we need to look back in our history for strong shining examples of black man/woman hood to move forward. That is what the magic of main character, Regina's, past life with Blue says to me at least.More importantly, Ms. Cleage nicely underhandely gives us some suggestions for African-American political empowerment through characters Beth and Precious.Stylistically, as I always I loved the language. There are no over-the-top love scenes. The book is almost thoroughly &quot;fleshed out.&quot; I did long for a little more about Regina's struggle with her cocaine addiction. The structure was pretty even. There are some really memorable characters here. And thanks Ms. Cleage for giving us real black girls a voice again and again. We can still have faith in black men, women, children, and black love.Peace"},{"Title":"Some Things I Never Thought Id Do","review":"In two words this novel moved me. I do not have the words in my vocabulary to expound on the effects this story had on me. When I finished reading it, the tears from my heart flowed freely. I was so engaged in the characters the ending was like a loss of life.Pearl Cleage has the ability to write characters that are not perfect, but are human. Her characters have human frailties and must deal with the ups and downs of life. Regina Burns is one of those characters. We meet Regina as she is literally begging a loan officer to not sale her house she borrowed against during her addiction to cocaine. From there we see Regina taking a chance and things falling in place. Her aunt tells Regina of her vision and what she sees in her future. Whether Regina believes it or not Atlanta will be the starting point.There are a host of characters you are drawn to and some you want to handle with a long handle stick. Once Regina arrives in Atlanta she meets the blue-eyed stranger that is part of her aunt's vision. Blue as he is called will be the past and future for Regina. We also meet Flora, Lu, Aretha and bad guys DooDoo and King James. We also meet Regina's mentor, Beth, who needs her expertise and gets more than she bargains for.Ms. Cleage has the ability to make you believe in hope, courage and honor. She however never lets us forget that the world is not perfect and no person is perfect in it. She uplifts the African-American males by portraying the good males alongside the no so good males. She upholds the spirit of community and neighbors. All though there is romance there is also love of family, friends and neighbors and shows us an endearing side of our African-American communities.The one thing that touched me and really expresses the title of the book is one statement that is made in the novel. That one statement is that no one is perfect, but we all have possibility of perfection. So profound and so true. No one is perfect but there is room for the possibility of perfection. That is what we should all esteem to be. Regina does as well as the other wonderful characters in this book.This is a page-turner from the opening lines. Well written and crafted by a gifted storyteller and writer. Thank you for moving me with this wonderful story. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"William Faulkner: American Writer","review":"... leaving a dried mass hard to swallow, not to mention digest. However it is possible to savor some flavors from the man's life, and there are moments of insight embedded in all the verbiage.It was a glorious spring Sunday morning in 1993; I was on the square in Oxford, and a wonderful bookstore was open \\"for services.\\" A fitting place to buy the book, and later wander with it around Faulkner's estate of Rowan Oaks; I was blessedly alone since it was closed for renovations. Clearly the setting set high hopes for the book, yet still...Make no mistake; it is all there, starting with the larger than life character of his great-grandfather, the \\"old colonel,\\" through his own life as a returning WWI \\"war hero,\\" with embellished tales of service, and trying to gain traction as a writer through most of the \`20's, which included joining the \\"Movable Feast\\" in Paris. Finally it \\"clicked\\" in the year 1929, the \\"annus mirabilis,\\" and in 30 days as he famously worked on the night shift at the water works, he wrote \\"As I Lay Dying,\\" the title inspired by a line from the Odyssey. \\"The Sound and the Fury,\\" and \\"Light in August\\" were complete in a short period, and within 20 years he was seated next to Bertrand Russell in Stockholm, receiving the Nobel Prize for literature. He had only 12 more years of life, one highlight of which was a year at the University of Virginia.His personal life is also there, from the need to embellish war service, to the numerous rejections for women, to the alcoholism and the later philandering, no doubt making up for those earlier rejections. Faulkner once said that he spent a lot of his life \\"fumbling under women's skirts.\\" But Karl does not convey the passion of any of this; it is dealt with in that dry academic detached style.More useful is certain descriptions of the mythical Yoknapatawpha county, as rendered on page 182, how pretty it looked from a distance, which hid such graphically conveyed matters at the \\"...drying spittle of religious controversy...\\" Later, (p286), Karl summarizes Faulkner's genius: \\"This transformation of what appeared on the surface a rather low-keyed place into a beehive of rancor, hatred, and violence, intermingled with routine life, was a great act of imagination, and Faulkner's greatest contribution to American fiction.\\"Karl describes the influences of other writers, such as James Joyce, on him, and in turn how Faulkner influenced a generation of Latin American \\"magic realism\\" writers. In \\"The Unvanquished,\\" a chapter is entitled \\"The Vendee,\\" and in an interview with Coindreau Faulkner said that from his reading of Balzac's \\"Les Chouans,\\" he felt \\"Southerners and people from La Vendee had much in common.\\" Later (p725) Karl quotes Sartre, who said: \\"for the youth of France, Faulkner is a god.\\"Five years before this book was published, Joseph Blotner also wrote a \\"door-stop\\" biography of Faulkner, yet at \\"only\\" 788 pages it was considerably less than this tome. It is a shame, perhaps some in the academic world proclaim these works, but the general reader could use a livelier, briefer biography of perhaps the greatest American writer."},{"Title":"Vilhjalmur Stefansson,young Arctic explorer;","review":"After reading another book by this author. My son begged me for all the other titles that were written. He is still reading so life is good"},{"Title":"Oil! a Novel","review":"One of my favorite books of all times. Upton Sinclair is a literary master. The book is intense, and moves through all its nearly 600 pages. It seems that the series Dallas had its origins in this old book. The characters and events are all believable. I highly recommend reading this book and learning about early California oil days."},{"Title":"Oil! a Novel","review":"Upton Sinclair wrote the novel \\"Oil!\\" to indict the Harding administration and the subsequent Republican presidency of Calvin Coolidge, but 'the business of America was business' in the Roaring Twenties, and Sinclair's call for political change was not heeded. The novel also contains other observations of the decade of excess: the new ministers of religious revivals, loosening morals, and the great American entertainment culture, particularly in Hollywood and athletics. Sinclair also bemoans the American attack on Communists and Bolshevism at the conclusion of World War I, highlighting a little-known police action in Russia called the American Expeditionary Force in Siberia.The main character of the novel is J. Arnold Ross, Junior - known as Bunny - who is the son of an oil scion that becomes embroiled in the Teapot Dome scandal. One can see how Harry Sinclair and Edward Doheny, the two oil operatives indicted in the oil reserve scandal, don't feel as though they did anything wrong after reading about J. Arnold Ross, Senior. They were businessmen jist using generally accepted business practices to deliver oil to an increasingly-modernized society that demanded fuel for its latest appurtenances. \`Jist' is an affectation of Bunny's father that became an overused pun in the novel.The oil reserve scandal resulted from unused lands reserved by Presidents Taft and Wilson for the navy. These reserves were considered necessary for national defense, given the importance of oil to the effort. The idle reserves at Teapot Dome in Wyoming and Elk City in California were eyed hungrily by oil moguls after World War I. A plan was hatched by some oilmen to contribute heavily to requests from the Ohio Gang that helped elect Warren Gamaleil Harding as President. Attorney General Harry Daugherty urged Harding to appoint Albert Fall as his Secretary of the Interior and convinced the Chief Executive to sign an order transferring administration of the oil reserves from the Navy to the Department of the Interior. Fall leased the oil rights to the two properties to men that made the Secretary of the Interior a $100,000 loan and a $300,000 loan. The loans did not bear interest, and - in fact - there were no plans arranged to repay them. Obviously, these cash transfers were only called loans after the scandal were publicly exposed by an investigating committee in Congress, in an attempt to mitigate the offensiveness of the scandal.Sinclair explores the business culture that allowed two oil executives to create such a bold plan to taint the Executive office. As the business of Southern California oilman J. Arnold Ross began to grow, he felt intense pressure to conform to industry standards in order to remain competitive. If Ross didn't sign up with an oil cartel, he couldn't find buyers for his oil. The company that once provided reasonably fair working conditions to its employees had to conform to industry standards which prescribed a series of decisions unfavorable to labor. The partner that Ross joined with, Vernon Roscoe, is loosely based on Edward Doheny, one of the participants in the oil reserve scandal.Such a twist to the story allows Sinclair to explore the labor movement, one of his pet issues. Labor organizations were riddled with Communists and Socialists at a time when America was plagued with the Red fear. Communists were the leading opponents of conscription to raise an army to fight World War One, and the government arrested the most prolific protestors for violating Sedition laws. The Supreme Court upheld these laws in 1919, with Judge Oliver Wendell Holmes likening the protest to \`falsely shouting fire in a crowded movie theatre.' Exactly what Charles Schenck and Eugene Debs wrote or said that was false has never been explained.Actually, the case of Charlotte Whitney has the most parallels to the happenings of this novel. Whitney was related to former Supreme Court Justice Stephen Fields, the judge most prominent in nudging the Supreme Court to adopt laissez-faire policies for business. Yet this child of means drifted to the left, similar to the path of Bunny Ross. Whitney was arrested for conspiracy to overthrow the government, much like the charges used on Paul Watkins and other labor activists featured in the novel. Whitney was hardly a revolutionary, but the prosecution charged that she was affiliated with organizations that were. Whitney was pardoned by New York Governor Al Smith, who reflected a more tolerant attitude towards free speech that was probably shaped by novels like Oil!The Twenties were a time where movie stars and professional athletes were covered extensively by the press. Some of this had to do with the personalities of the stars: Babe Ruth was eminently quotable and likeable. Some workers had more time to attend sporting events and watch movies in the Twenties after some changes of the Progressive Movement improved their lot.Naturally, some people wanted to imitate the lifestyles of new American heroes of the tabloids. Affordable automobiles produced by the assembly line of Henry Ford allowed them to do so. Mobility enabled people to live in suburbs and commute to work - it also provided young adults more freedom to socialize without chaperones. Some of the girlfriends of Bunny Ross in the novel, particularly Eunice Hoyt and Viola Tracy, were examples of the sexually liberated flappers that appeared during the decade. However, the Twenties were a far cry from the Seventies. Conservative women like Ruth Watkins, and attitudes like her brother Paul (Stay away from my sister!) were still the standard in the Twenties, and several decades after.Sinclair was opposed to the First World War, then supported the country after President Wilson declared war, and reverted to his original stance in its aftermath. Undoubtedly, the guard duty in Siberia had some influence over Sinclair's opinion, though he was jist as likely to reconsider his original view after the glow of patriotism wore off. You can find plenty more about this intervention by looking up \`US Army in Russia 1918-1920' on the internet. One character in this novel, Paul Watkins, regretted his decision to enlist in the US Army because of his detail in Russia. Watkins equated many events of the Red Scare to the same underlying reasons why the United States was involved in the policed action in Russia.Oil! is similar to Sinclair's early novels, such as the Moneychangers, where Sinclair shuffled the cards and created nearly all fictional characters to tell his story. His best novels, those of the Lanny Budd series, included liberal appearances of actual historical figures. The size of this novel (548 pages) and its willingness to take on a myriad of issues in the Twenties while remaining true to the main issue of the Teapot Dome scandal make it more similar to the Lanny Budd novels. Some memorable scenes of the Lanny Budd series were first given test runs in Oil! His father shows an interest in the sort of spiritualism that John Edward made famous to today's readers about ten years ago. One of the mediums brings to mind Madame Zyzinski. Upton Sinclair dabbled in this practice more heavily after he wrote this novel, so the briefly-mentioned crossing-over scenes here became a part of the plot in the Lanny Budd novels. The battles between pinks and reds aren't as pointed as they become in Lanny Budd, but there are characteristics in Paul Watkins that evoke the communist in the early Lanny Budd novels - his Uncle Jessie Blackless.Upton Sinclair cared little for religion, but was nevertheless fascinated by it. The character Eli Watkins becomes a preacher in the Four Square Church, which was started in real life by Aimee Semple McPherson. Watkins is also loosely based on McPherson: in fact, Upton Sinclair wrote a poem about her abduction in 1926. The poem called \\"An Evangelist Drowns,\\" is not too hard to find on the internet. For a more in-depth portrait of McPherson by a novelist, try Elmer Gantry by Sinclair Lewis. The title character of the book forms a partnership with Sharon Falconer, and it is not too hard to detect the similarities between the real-life McPherson and the Sinclair Lewis character.Sorry about the earful, mac, but this book is the bee's knees."},{"Title":"Oil! a Novel","review":"He was a great writer. The first 50 pages are just driving down the coast of California in some of the first cars. This is worth reading the book for alone. Then he goes into the oil business, which the movie focused on.

We are able to take a peek at life in the 1920\`s as though we are there. The social milieu is described so much in depth that the interest in the book does not let up, even though it is somewhat long.

I found his writing style interesting: a strange mixture of omniscient and 3rd person viewpoint with Bunny the central character. Sinclair also uses 2nd person a lot, but it's hard to know whom he is addressing by \\"you\\" -- the reader? the reader if you were Bunny?For me, the father/son story was the most interesting and the Hollywood starlets the most boring. Like a George Barnard Shaw play, Sinclair uses his characters as mouthpieces for the various points of view at the time. Though it's clear that the author leans toward socialism, I thought he gave the capitalist father a fairly sympathetic airing, especially early in the book, and I squirmed at his portrayal of Bunny as the chicken-livered \\"liberal\\" that I recognize as myself.Certainly a memorable book.Dana Bagshaw"},{"Title":"Oil! a Novel","review":"It must be pointed out that the film-makers of There Will Be Blood were INSPIRED by the book, they didn't suggest that the film was actually BASED on the book, therefore the movie and novel are different.

A lot of his \\"message/topical novels are now unread.

Upton Sinclair was a much more talented and subtle novelist than the screenwriters who adapted the book for Hollywood. Instead of the one-dimensional greedy and homicidal sociopath of the movie, Sinclair's oil man is much more nuanced and believable, and therefore more interesting. Not that the novel is any more favorable to the oil business. Just asThe Jungleshows inside knowledge of Chicago meat-packing industry and immigrant communities, Sinclair did his homework here, and clearly knows in detail about the oil industry of the period. The result is an interesting story of the oil industry and Southern California society in the teens and 1920s.But just as in The Jungle, as the plot progresses, Oil! increasingly bogs down in the tar pit of Sinclair's socialist propagandizing. This aspect of the novel seems today quaintly nave. In the novel, all socialists are pure and idealistic. The Soviet Union is the wave of the future, and stories of Soviet prison camps are only evil capitalist lies meant to fool the working class. In the hands of a lesser novelist, Oil! would be just a period piece of 1920s socialist propaganda, but Sinclair's writing talent shines through none the less."},{"Title":"Oil! a Novel","review":"If one can look through the Muckraking Sinclair is doing, the book paints a detailed portrait of the oil industry, movie industry and overall life in southern California in the 1920's."},{"Title":"Oil! a Novel","review":"Take about two chapters out of the book and make a movie that is 10 times better than the book was. I hate to start a book and not finish it, and I stuck with this one. But one of the worst books I have ever read. Characters were so silly and the whole book was a propaganda piece for socialism."},{"Title":"Oil! a Novel","review":"It's the year 2007. America is hastily at war over something it's politicians still won't answer too. Resources, religion, and patriotism are have woven together to form a toxic mix of cross-divisional nepotism. In short, not much has changed since the Harding Administration.Who will decide the election of 2008 is the oil industry. You're either for it or against it. If the victor is someone like Barack Obama, and Iraq is (rightfully) abandoned, the immediate tied supply of oil to this country in the middle east will diminish, possibly forcing that giant military budget and expenditure to be transferred to progressive research of electrical engines and other reusable alternatives to maintain economy of life. If not, and the victor is John McCain or Rudy Guiliani, expect to be at war for another five years to maintain a fair cost of transportation (esp. for popular American vehicles such as trucks and sport-utility-vehicles). That's what happens when one powerful political faction is sponsored by the most profitable business in the world...and that business, in the next 20 years, may be depletable. It's oil vs. the cost of life...when you vote, you're inevitably chosing one.Although first published in the 1920's (as \\"Oil!: There Will Be Blood\\") Upton Sinclair's novel plays out as a perfect metaphor for our time sprawled out in the southern California oil boom of the early 20th century. The story centers around a man named John Plainview, whose father purchases land near the Cali/Mexico border with the intention of making a profit during the intense southern California migration that occurred at this time. Instead, the man dies and Plainview, by accident, strikes oil on the land and becomes a small-scale prospector intent on making it rich. Soon bigger facets of the industry take notice (including mass-bully corporations that allude to real companies and oil barons like J.P. Morgan), and begin buying and setting up industry around Plainview's claim. All the while, the exponentially growing population becomes enthralled with religious revivalism in the form of the preacher Eli Sunday, who upon arrival, is befriended by Plainview and is seen as a surrogate son. As Plainview refuses to submit to taking the bribes offered by the encrouching companies for his land, Sunday must take a side.The novel is very dense, and like other Sinclair works, such as \\"The Jungle\\" (the book for whom he's most known), strong socialist themes and sentiments run throughout. By the end, Plainview remains a man whose self-made dreams have been vanquished and beaten by capitalism. Up against those with limitless funds, there is no victory in sight...only a small, impending fall from grace.Recently it was announced that this novel (which if you've read it, will instantly seem unadaptable) will be made into a movie. I groaned when I read it, but I also immediately plowed my way to [...] and typed in the title....and low and behold I was speechless. Daniel 'the greatest living actor' Day-Lewis as Plainview! Jack 'jackie-jack, mr. Spacek of \\"The New World\\" himself' Fisk as the film's production designer!! Photographed by Robert 'master-steadicamist and \\"Syriana\\" I-know-my-s#it cinematographer' Elswitt!!! Scored by the great Jon 'you-need-to-work-with-Aimee-again' Brion!!!! And written and directed by.. 'drum-roll please' PTA!!!!!So yeah, no matter how much of the story is kept intact, the authenticity and timeliness will certainly be there. It's being done by the best. Set to be released Dec. 2007. Nine short months. I can't wait!"},{"Title":"Oil! a Novel","review":"Although I, like numerous others, started reading this because of \\"There Will Be Blood\\" (which I found disturbingly fascinating), I can't say I enjoyed this book at all. I'll just reiterate that it is NOTHING like the movie.Before I got Kindle for iPod, I ordered this in paperback, which I never received OR was reimbursed for, so I read \\"King Coal\\" by the same author instead. It was a real slog and was so predictable and overwrought that I didn't even bother reading the last chapter or so. It's very rare that I've not finished a book after hours and hours of reading, but it was just too much work and not nearly enough intellectual stimulation.I found \\"Oil!\\" to be cut from the same cloth once I got past the first few chapters. If you want to be beaten over the head with the evils (perceived or genuine) of Capitalism, be my guest. I haven't finished the last chapter or two of this book yet either for the same reasons as stated above although I have done my best to persevere. The fact that I got it last November does not bode well for reaching the end.Although I normally like stories set in this era (circa 1900-1920), I find this book odious mostly because it deals with serious issues in such flippant ways by many of the characters in such an inconsistent way. I suspect that the body of this author's work in general is an absolute chore to read. On the other hand, however, many of the author's insights on the oil business itself are frightenly accurate. For that I give Mr. Sinclair kudos.By about the middle of the book, our idealistic \\"hero\\" (who goes by the nickname \\"Bunny\\" - which is just irritating), can't seem to make up his mind about nearly anything - especially the people he chooses to associate with for vastly different and mostly selfish reasons - or to follow any convictions he may espouse or propose to espouse. He hates the corporations and encourages the workers' movements (in complete opposition to how he himself became so wealthy and privileged), but can't seem to pry himself away from either of these factions long enough to give himself any true respectability or certainty in whichever forum.It's a preachy trudge by an author that can't seem to do much else in my (admittedly limited) experience. His writing is repetitive, politically wishy-washy on most points in regards to his protagonist and just generally becomes really boring.Stick with the movie."},{"Title":"Oil! a Novel","review":"This is a great book. I also got this book in a timely manner."},{"Title":"Oil! a Novel","review":"This book makes no sense whatsoever, like the other books by Upton Sinclair. It is a 500+ page rant about how everyone will be rich if everyone becomes a socialist and goes on strike, even though the reality is that everyone will be poor if this happens.Having said that, it is useful to read even if you smart enough to understand that socialism is bunk because it shows that socialists have great difficulty arguing against capitalism UNLESS the so-called \\"capitalists\\" are paying bribes to public officials.I am a capitalist. And, I hate people who pay and receive bribes. I believe that all people who pay and receive bribes should be locked in prison. These people are not capitalists and they give a bad name to capitalists since socialists falsely claim that these people are capitalists.Therefore, this book is a useful \\"wake up\\" call to capitalists to fight corruption so that socialists cannot use corruption as a reason to implement socialist government, which is the ulimate form of corruption.Besides that, this book is also useful because it is a portrait of Southern California life at an interesting time in history.John Christmas, author of \\"Democracy Society\\""},{"Title":"Oil! a Novel","review":"I saw the movie and thought the book would be a good read.

While interesting in the beginning, I was hard pressed to finish it, though I did. If you really want to read this liberal trash, rather than buy the book, I would borrow it from the library. Not worth owning..."},{"Title":"Oil! a Novel","review":"After seeing what is certainly the most thought-provoking film of the present millennium, \\"There Will Be Blood,\\" and receiving a recommendation from a friend, I decided to give Upton Sinclair another look. In college English courses he's usually acknowledged but passed over quickly--categorized and dismissed as an \\"issues\\" author--a muckraker, a social critic, a purveyor of \\"period piece\\" literature--but unworthy of the attention afforded Hemingway, Fitzgerald, and of course Faulkner.Give Faulkner his due (after reading enough of him, you'll understand why race matters, why one can have immaculate white skin and still be black, why blackness is humanness), but I'm nevertheless convinced that academia has done huge injustices by much American literature. Writers like Edna Ferber, Theodore Dreiser, James Michener, and Upton Sinclair--once popular but now considered \\"out of date\\"-- write with pens that are vibrant, thunderous, and universal.The danger that's always lying in wait for writers who aren't afraid to hold the mirror up to the injustices of their time is that they invoke images and vocabulary that a later generation may perceive as propagandist, as \\"old news,\\" or \\"politically incorrect\\" (this latter perception is as good an excuse as any not to read someone).Sinclair pulls off the improbable--he humanizes then reduces to caricature a character who represents an American ideal--the American dream, the radical individualist, the admirable entrepreneur, the creator of new frontiers, the bold adventurer and almighty conqueror, the practitioner of a relentless work ethic who becomes a captain of industry--an American prototype that is at once the embodiment of civilization at its apex and the bearer of bestial, primitive, degenerate, immoral and amoral impulses scarcely recognizable as human let alone civilized. The revered becomes the reviled; both are made of the same cloth. It's selfishness and pride (the worst of the seven deadly sins) that ultimately explain the character and condemn the entire economic-social machinery of a bloodless and blood-letting free-enterprise, capitalistic system.In making his point, Sinclair at one point invokes an image that he knows his Puritanical American audience (or Victorian British reader) is all too familiar with: the African \\"savage.\\" (Horrors! How can Sinclair's protagonist, this avatar of \\"progress,\\" be compared to the most primitive specimen of non-civilization?) It was meant to be shocking, and no doubt it was. It's ironic, to say the least, that the present-day enlightened reader is likely to be shocked not by this characterization of American \\"progress\\" but by the portrayal of the African in such unflattering terms.In the 1920s Duke Ellington lured white wealthy customers to Harlem's Cotton Club by offering what he billed as \\"jungle music.\\" The invitation was readily accepted by the unsoiled rich as an opportunity to have a taste of the exotic and the naughty, a quick thrill provided by momentary \\"slumming.\\" But not for a moment did those same customers imagine they were seeing a mirror of their own condition, any more than they would confuse the Cotton Club with the Metropolitan Opera House or Carnegie Hall. The \\"wording\\" of Sinclair's metaphor may no longer be socially correct, but the metaphor's meaning is unmistakable: America's magnificent obsession is also its most flagrant self-deception. What Sinclair describes as a \\"progress\\" that has taken us back to a Darwinian jungle, Fitzgerald at the end of \\"Gatsby\\" describes as immigrant boats beating against America's offshore currents in vain, forever being carried back out to sea.Fitzgerald's metaphor plays better in the classroom (though its oblique symbolism and muted cynicism often fail to make an impression on literalist, easily distracted, young minds); Sinclair's more controversial one at least receives attention and raises questions--about progress, selfishness, consumerism, the American Dream reduced to the worship of mammon, cars and oil. The political correctness issue is a small price to pay in exchange for provoking some serious reflection on these momentous, acutely timely matters."},{"Title":"Oil! a Novel","review":"This is one of the best political books I've ever read. It doesn't pack the punch of Orwell's \\"1984,\\" which was nearly complete in its condemnation of human political interests. Instead, the tone of Oil! is almost playful with a strange jockular voice narrating it. Still, it is dead serious in its use of oil as a theme to tell about the warring factions of capitalists, socialists and communists.The story begins on a small scale with a young man (Bunny) and his father (always referred to as \\"Dad\\") rushing to a meeting in their car. They are driving at speeds up to 50 mph! And Dad describes all the ways that motorcycle cops might catch them and how they could be bribed. The topic of bribery gets larger throughout the book as Dad and his cronies buy the election of Warren G. Harding so they can get oil leases which belong to the navy.Those who saw the fine movie \\"There Will Be Blood\\" will find that only the first part of the book is in the movie. Interestingly, the son is the main character in the book and was secondary in the movie. Also, the movie featured Eli Watkins as a revivalist preacher when the larger character in the book is the other brother, Paul Watkins, a revolutionary.One interesting thing about Oil! is that it is so readable. There are few stock dramatic scenes. In fact, it's almost told from a distance as if some not-too-bright person is relating something they don't fully understand.As I finished reading Oil! I became more and more angry about the political system and the influence of money in government. It happened then and it is happening right now. Read it, and do something about it."},{"Title":"Oil! a Novel","review":"The film \\"There will be blood\\" is a shameless travesty of the book, which analyses the corruption in the oil industry and the intimidation of the unions. Anyone who admires the works of Ayn Rand should get a dose of this by way of a cure. Even the well-intentioned main characters get sucked into the maelstrom of big business. Unfortunately after 300 pages it becomes a bit boring, as the author tries to put in too much, but by then 99% of the readers will have learned a valuable lesson."},{"Title":"Oil! a Novel","review":"After the first chapter this book takes off. The story chronicles the tale of a father and son. Or is it the story of oil development in Southern California, or perhaps a the story which pits labor vs. business? Well it is all of that and much more. His tale is finely woven with elements from early parts of the story coming back which wraps the story very tightly. This authors style reminds me very much of James Michener. For me when a story is good I am able to imagine the actors that would portray the parts. In this story I imagined Brian Denehy as the father and Matt Dillon as the son. To keep the story fictitious the author uses \\"Angel City\\" and vicinity as the setting, but you easily convert all of Southern California in your mind. Since the story is very much about a father and son relationship, I see this a very male oriented book. But there are also themes of greed, love, jealousy, and alturisum. It will now be interesting to see the movie. UPDATE: I saw the movie and it didn't even come close in doing justice to the book, the book is soooooo much better."},{"Title":"Oil! a Novel","review":"This is a great fictional story based on the real life of Edward Doheny, who was from my home town of Fond du Lac, Wisconsin. Doheny was a larger than life character and is well known in California.I somehow missed reading any of Upton Sinclair's work over the years and now I know what I have missed. This is a fast moving story that tells of the early years, and greed, of the oil industry. Sinclair's descriptions are so real that I can smell the orange groves and the oil from a gusher and his characters are portrayed as real people. This is a very informative and enjoyable read. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in the history of the oil industry in California."},{"Title":"Oil! a Novel","review":"Sinclair is a writer with an agenda, and his cause is the promotion of socialism. This was somewhat apparent in his most well-known novel, The Jungle, but that book also included an interesting story and a most horrifying picture of the meat packing industry, which caught the attention of the public and actually led to legislative changes. Unfortunately, Oil's story line is less engaging and the abuses revealed of oil price-fixing and government corruption are less immediate (and less fixable, perhaps) than was the problem of unsanitary meat. The edition I read is a re-issue, because the movie There Will Be Blood used the novel as inspiration. (More about that later.)The novel tells the story of Bunny Ross, the privileged heir to the fortune of a self-made independent oilman, following his life from the age of 9 or 10 until his mid-20's. Through his (somewhat contrived) life story, the reader meets wildcatting wheeler-dealers, corrupt politicians, self-involved rich college students, Hollywood starlets, a cynical evangelist, and various idealistic socialist and communist young people. The plot is episodic and seems to be tacked together so that Sinclair can air his views about various segments of America's capitalistic society and promote socialism as a solution to the country's problems.This sort of didactic writing can be effective when the central characters are fully realized and sympathetic (as in The Grapes of Wrath), or when the plot is inventive or suspenseful (as in 1984) . Unfortunately, Oil lacks both these elements. Sinclair is a very capable writer, particularly in his descriptive passages, but in this book he seems clearly to be more concerned with persuading and airing grievances than with telling a story well.The movie There Will Be Blood focuses on the father rather than on Bunny and follows the novel's plot only at the beginning, before totally departing to create a new, very different story-line.This is interesting to read as an overview of socialist theory, but less than interesting as literature."},{"Title":"Oil! a Novel","review":"I have been wanting to read this book for quite some time now. I finally bought it and jumped right in. The first quarter of the book is enthralling and very interesting. If you loved the movie &#34;There Will Be Blood&#34; the beginning will also be your favorite part. It is the basis for the whole movie. After the first part of the book, however, it takes a very different turn and becomes a commentary about social injustices and the unfairness of the oil industry and labor in general. This truly is a book on class warfare and how to even the odds for every man. No doubt interesting, but very long and gets irritatingly repetitive. I believe it is worth reading once, for sure. More than likely will not become your favorite book but it is a fun read."},{"Title":"Oil! a Novel","review":"The great Upton Sinclair knew the oil industry's economics were unfairly split, not only among workers and management, but society as well paid greater taxes and felt then and still feels now the sting of corporate greed. Sinclair's depth of understanding of how that industry functions led him into politics, and he was, in fact, the Democratic candidate for Governor of California in the 1930's. He exposed the bad guys for his whole working life. OIL is great, not simply because it was written by an important twentieth century American artist, but because it was written the great societal contributor, Upton Sinclair. He was a great historian."},{"Title":"Oil! a Novel","review":"I read this book the first time when I was around 13. I read a lot back then, and it took me a good while to read the first time.

Nothing like the movie but still a good read."},{"Title":"Oil! a Novel","review":"Unlike Sinclair's best-known novel, \\"The Jungle,\\" with its bleak story and gloomy characters, \\"Oil!\\" is a fast-paced, lively and colorful story. Although Sinclair uses it to preach his political views, it is nevertheless a good piece of literature and an interesting historical testimony to the era in which it was written. Another striking thing is how Sinclair's descriptions of corporate manipulations tend to mirror very recent events. Interesting also is that Sinclair uses one of the oldest cliches in American literature, the coming-of-age story, as the vehicle for this epic; at the same time, there are indications that Sinclair seems to mock this manner of story-telling - from the main character's rather silly nick-name, \\"Bunny\\" to his perennial inability to make up his mind about where he wants to go with his life, i.e. he never really 'comes of age.' Other reviewers have noted Sinclair's apparently naive promotion of socialism/communism/the Bolsheviks, which is a valid criticism, although to me it seemed more a case of the author throwing out ideas to provoke readers into thinking rather than an attempt to persuade them. In this sense, his use of the family of a wealthy California oil baron as the main protagonists is quite telling: although Sinclair does take the opportunity to highlight the hypocrisy and greed of the moneyed classes, he also makes a genuine attempt to portray them as real people rather than just grotesque caricatures. I also noticed that many of his characterizations of the working class/poor are often less than flattering. Regardless, this is a really entertaining novel, probably Sinclair's best."},{"Title":"Oil! a Novel","review":"When Warren G. Harding died suddenly in California in 1923, he was one of the most beloved President's ever. It wasn't long, however, before that opinion changed, so that today he is considered among the worst. The revelation after his death of the Teapot Dome scandal that occurred during his administration was paramount in destroying his reputation. And it involved oil (the naval oil reserves in Wyoming were being sold off by corrupt politicians close to Harding). Sinclair based this novel on Teapot Dome. It basically shows how a decent man and his son Bunny Ross are up against insurmountable odds in the oil business, what with corruption all around. Sinclair's solution was dramatic: for him socialism was the answer; capitalism was too corrupt. A big, brawling novel, not particularly memorable for its style; but its muscular approach and willingness to tackle important issues make it worth reading."},{"Title":"Oil! a Novel","review":"Anyone who wants a vivid, first-hand account of Southern California life in the 1920's will love this novel. It captures the go-go energy of the times, peppered with jazz-era slang, which perhaps was so fresh at the time this novel was written that Sinclair chose to put these terms in quotations. (Modern readers will be surprised that most of this slang is in common use today). Of course, one can't ignore the larger political, social and cultural themes that explode upon these pages. The oil boom that grips everyone in Southern California is just the tip of the iceberg. The weirder aspect is how little has changed in the past 75 years, We are still grappling with the same issues of political corruption, wage inequality, excesses of capitalism, cult of celebrity, and lest we forget, the youth and car culture. Even more disturbing are the passing references to American oil interests in the middle east. There's some laugh out loud passages; one of the most memorable concerns an Oklahoma oil man who lays on the down-home drawl to intimadate European diplomats. Hmmmm, now that sounds familiar...."},{"Title":"Oil! a Novel","review":"I came to \\"Oil!\\" for two reasons. One, I had recently read \\"The Jungle,\\" and became enamored with Sinclair's wit and prose; two, I had watched \\"There Will Be Blood,\\" and found it such a thought-provoking film that I had better read the book that inspired it. (This tactic worked recently for me, with \\"Blood's\\" ideological counterpart \\"No Country Old Men\\", which got me hooked on the writing of Cormac McCarthy.)I hesitate to throw out a disclaimer, but I must assume that many potential readers will come to this book through the movie, so I have to say it: The book is nothing like the film (which directer Paul Thomas Anderson has stated); the movie gets its start from the first few pages of \\"Oil!\\"; which means, since there's over 500 pages left, that there's quite a bit of story yet to tell.I say this simply as a disclaimer. By all means, buy the book and read it. Upton Sinclair was known for his Socialist sympathies (\\"Oil!\\", like \\"The Jungle,\\" reads like a Socialist manifesto), but what interests me about his writing is how his prose is still poetic and witty. Yes, there are some political points that, now having experienced WWII and the Cold War, seem dated; but in 1927, Sinclair was a borderline-revolutionary, and his Socialist sympathies put him in danger. He managed to convey that fear to \\"Oil!\\", which details an oil tycoon's son, as he slips into the Socialist world and ends up fighting the industry that made his dad a success. I wouldn't say \\"Oil!\\" is as cutting-edge as \\"The Jungle\\" was, but it certainly is a social commentary/satire that cuts straight to the bone of American capitalism. Written eighty years ago, it still holds power today; if that isn't a sign of great literature, then I just don't know what is."},{"Title":"Oil! a Novel","review":"THERE'S NO BUSINESS LIKE THE OIL BUSINESS, LIKE NO BUSINESS YOU'LL KNOW.A bit different from the movie, \\"Oil\\" is a story written from the third person narrative of Bunny Arnold Ross Jr, son of oil tycoon, Arnold Ross. The story follows Arnold Ross from scroungy wildcatter to oil tycoon.\\"Oil\\" was written at the turn of the century by \\"muckraker\\" Upton Sinclair. I've read a lot of Sinclair novels and have come to own many of his first editions, but his appeal to me was not immediate. The Jungle, for example, was written about the Chicago meatpacking industry. It's publication-first as a special edition for members of the Communist Party- provoked the government to pass the meat inspecting standards that we now have-\\"USDA Inspected\\". Sinclair novels often lack denouement and the plots are thinly disguised vehicles for presenting a litany of horrors perpetrated against the poor by greedy capitalists. The list of horrors can be shocking-workers lost limbs in vats of meat and production was not stopped to recover the limb or help the dying man-but even lists of horrors need to be presented with strong plots.What is present in \\"Oil\\" the novel that is not present in \\"There Will Be Blood\\" is that Bunny argues fervently with his father on behalf of his father's oil workers. In the movie, we see Daniel Day Lewis stopping work for a day when an oil worker is crushed at the bottom of a well. In a Sinclair novel, the worker would have been left at the bottom of the well as long as he wasn't clogging flow. Or you see Daniel Day Lewis tenderly adopt the orphaned child of a friend. In a Sinclair novel, an orphaned child that needed feeding and couldn't work would have been left to die in the desert. Sinclair presented the difference between capitalists and socialists starkly. Capitalists were always and completely without humanity.The novel actually explains a lot of holes in the movie. The parting of Arnold and his son when Arnold is grown didn't make a lot of sense to me in the film. Arnold writes off his adopted son indifferently and there isn't anything in the movie which predicates that kind of reaction. We see Arnold grooming his son, sending him to a special school after his eyes are burned, yearning for him when he is gone. Writing him off when he's 20 seems to make no sense at all. But in the book Bunny and Arnold have spent a lifetime arguing the socialist agenda and Arnold feels that a man with Bunny's convictions can't be his son and lets him go. What is also missing in the film but explained in the book is the sudden and unexplained disappearance of Arnold's best friend. I guess the film didn't want to risk appearing socialist but I'm not sure the script makes sense without the presence of socialist ideals in it.No socialist portrayal of the world would be complete without running down the opiate of the masses, religion. Sinclair's novel depicts religion as hoodwinking the oppressed rather than helping them. Arnold's struggle in the movie isn't just against the socialists who have claimed his son, but against religion which is threatening to claim existence.Sinclair novels are historically important if not always the greatest page turning reads. In a day and age when the media is manipulated by corporate sponsors and free speech is suppressed by the government, it's interesting to read novels from 70 years ago that changed the course of American life. Novels like these will make you yearn for honest publishers who were willing to take a chance on something that might change the world. But be prepared to shift your expectations when you go from modern literature to a Sinclair novel. Read it from the point of view of someone that lived a hundred years ago and you'll appreciate it. If you compare it to your page turning novels of today, you'll be disappointed."},{"Title":"Oil! a Novel","review":"\\"Oil!\\" can barely be said to be the basis of the movie \\"There Will be Blood.\\" The movie is a new millennium monologue representation of a dialogue showing the struggle of two classes dramatized in the book. In \\"Oil!\\" the oil man's son is the vehicle for the struggle of ideas between his capitalist father and his worker-oriented union organizer friend, Paul. In a perfect caricature of present-day society, the movie entirely omits the working-class side of the debate which in the book is viewed through the eyes of the oil man's son. In a world where huge media corporations now dominate the worldwide flow of ideas, a world from which ideas favorable to the working person are entirely absent, the movie \\"There Will be Blood\\" takes a book which is about a dialogue between two classes and turns it into a monologue. In other words, the movie ripped out the guts of the book.The really interesting questions in the book were entirely omitted such as:In the book the father struggling against the huge oil companies---reflecting the fight of the medium and small business person to survive against huge corporate interests.Most importantly, the son being friends with Paul, the radical labor organizer. This friendship and the pull of Paul's ideas places the \\"young oil prince\\" in a severe conflict with the circumstances of his birth, and that is the basic conflict of the book--entirely missing not only from the movie but from \\"mainstream\\" media. If you've seen the movie, the book becomes particularly interesting so you can see what is being withheld from you.If you do decide to read the book, the prose is in an older historical style, not the style that flows from computers, so be ready to adjust to a different style. Also, there are some long paragraphs about how wooden oil derricks are constructed, and I recommend that you skip these unless you have some tremendous interest in wooden oil derricks of the past."},{"Title":"Oil! a Novel","review":"I am sure that many people have compared _Oil_ with \\"There Will Be Blood,\\" the film loosely based on the novel. Each is excellent in its own way. _Oil_ is a well written, stirring novel, with richly developed and complex characters. The film's screen writer chooses to tell how greed thoroughly warps and corrupts a self-made oil barren. The oil man in the book, J. Arnold Ross, Sr., is a far more complicated man. Although a \\"greedy capitalist\\" as is the entire capitalist system according to the author, Upton Sinclair, Ross, Sr. is often a compassionate man. He agrees to post bail for friends of his son's imprisoned for holding \\"communist inspired meetings\\" calling for abolishing the enslavement and exploitation of working men by the capitalist system. Ross Sr. sympathizes with some of the wage demands of his striking workers, but is stymied in his support of them for fear of ostracism from a corporate federation to which he belongs.Ross, Jr., nicknamed Bunny in the novel, is a sensitive, intelligent, and well educated young man. While Bunny loves and admires his father and is the heir to Ross Sr.'s millions, Bunny works against what his father believes, and heartily sympathizes with the ideals of his \\"Bolshevik\\" friends. Bunny's sister, Bertie, firmly against and embarrassed by her brother's socialist activities, believes that his behavior is preventing her being invited to join the monied class to which she feels entitled.Bunny, from childhood on, becomes close friends with Paul Watkins, one of the sons of the family from whom Ross Sr. cheaply bought the land from which his oil wells were drilled. Paul, a true believer in the radical movement, is one of the most important influences in Bunny's life. Bunny becomes involved with Vee, a movie starlet, who, like his sister, is also against Bunny's socialist leanings. Vernon Roscoe, Ross Sr's partner and perhaps the most corrupt character in the book, believes in industry working closely with and even bribing government officials, which Vernon believes is for the benefit of all.The last section of the novel, where Bunny becomes particularly close with Rachel Menzies, a Jewish girl who shares much of Bunny's beliefs, is fast paced and engrossing, as is much of the book. One of the only negative aspects of the book is the author's and some of its characters' naive belief that Soviet Russia held promise as a model for a worker's state. This can be forgiven because the book ends in the 1920's before many of the Soviet Union's failings, particularly under Stalin, were uncovered. Although the novel ends tragically, there is some promise held out for a better and fairer world for the members of the working class."},{"Title":"Oil! a Novel","review":"Sinclair's writing style is gregarious, repetitive. He hits you on the head with the 'poor working class stiff' schtick, but if you can get past it, what he's describing is actually quite interesting. Sinclair's book is a worthwhile read not only for its striking similarities to our own times, which many people have already stated. But his depictions of the early 20th century in southern California, the social mores, the living conditions, the locations -- are all his images, as he experienced them, or imagined them. They may not have been 'real' but they are certainly what we no longer experience. Los Angeles and Long Beach with derricks, dirt road travelling, working class lives, oak forests in places no longer existant, oil derrick explosions. It was incredibly interesting to read Sinclair's version of how derricks were built, maintained, and occasionally destroyed. Highly recommended for California early 20th century history buffs."},{"Title":"Oil! a Novel","review":"\\"Oil\\" may be the title of Upton Sinclair's expansive work of historical fiction first published in 1927, but the meat of the novel is about the incipient titanic struggle between Communism and Capitalism dating to the closing days of World War I. In Sinclair's view (one which has largely been censored from popular views of American history), Russian Bolsheviks quickly became the nemesis of American and European Capitalism. Efforts at \\"containment\\" started immediately after the war with the maintenance of a large American garrison in Vladivostok to protect the railway and munitions assets of J.P. Morgan that were securing a loan to the British government. According to Sinclair, the U.S. government also financed and encouraged multiple mercenary armies (most notably in Poland) along the Russian borders in an effort to neutralize the Communist takeover. This was all done at the behest of \\"big business\\" interests in the U.S. who expected that our armed forces would protect them and their assets anywhere in the world. This is one of the main threads that Sinclair continues to develop for the remainder of the novel. The author is remarkable in his ability delineate the opposing viewpoints in this monumental battle which has affected so many of the events of the past 70 years. Here's a prescient quote from 1927. \\"You really think there'll be another war, Paul?\\" \\"Paul answered that armaments produce wars automatically; the capitalists who make the armaments have to see that they are used, in order to get to make more. Bunny said that the idea of another war seemed too horrible to think about; and Paul replied, \\"So you don't think about it, and that makes it easy for the business men to get it ready\\" In view of our current involvement in the Middle East, one has to wonder when if ever we will be able to get onto a different path forward."},{"Title":"Oil! a Novel","review":"Upton Sinclair was born in Baltimore, Maryland in 1878, but is associated with the state of California. Until Sinclair, the state was considered rock solid Republican, a conservative bastion reflecting the rugged individualism of the Gold Rush. San Franciscans supported the Republican Abraham Lincoln. Los Angelenos were literally \\"recruited\\" by General Harrison Otis and his son-in-law, Harry Chandler; hard-working Midwestern farms and Southern evangelicals who would comprise a WASP citizenry to make their city great.After World War I, slowly change occurred. The film industry grew, and they brought with them strong liberal tendencies. Unions gained power in San Franciso. When the Okies arrived during the Dust Bowl, the Left used their plight to advocate for change. Franklin Roosevelt, the New Deal and the Great Depression had a profound affect on the state. Enter Upton Sinclair.His 1906 novel The Jungle was a classic muckraker, exposed terrible conditions in the U.S. meat packing industry. Written after posing undercover for seven weeks as a worker in a Chicago meatpacking plant, the public furor helped pass the 1906 Pure Food and Drug Act and the Meat Inspection. Time magazine called him \\"a man with every gift except humor and silence.\\" Sinclair singularly helped launch the union movement, particularly in California. He was pitted against General Harrison Gray Otis. In 1910 union thugs bombed General Otis's L.A. Times building, killing 21. General Otis used his paper to besmirch all of the union movement, claiming the bombings were emblematic of all union activity nationwide. In so doing, he went too far and faced a backlash of sympathy, in large measure caused by Sinclair and his dramatic depictions of non-union factories.Sinclair ran for Congress as a Socialist and had a Utopian colony he founded burn down, probably by Right-wing extremists. He worked closely with the Leftist British filmmaker Charlie Chaplin and moved to Southern California in the 1920s.While The Jungle was a huge hit with immediate social impact, his novel of oil pioneers in California, called simply Oil!, remains a picture, a snapshot of what Left-wing radicalism looked like and how they thought in the 1920s. Communism has been demonized for decades. Today, the Right and the left are squared off against each other in bare knuckles struggle, played out daily on Fox News, CNN, the blogs and talk radio. To some extent, the two sides are so pat in their opinions, so protective of their bases and interests, that it seems they have always been that way. The history of the two ideologies is lost in the mix. Juat as it is eye-opening to look back at the crass language and open hostility of McCarthyism, so to is it instructive to see just what the Left thought, felt and advocated during this vital time.Sinclair was committed. So was the Right. During and after World War I, arrests, deportations and even executions of radicals/anarchists were commonplace. J. Edgar Hoover minced no words: they were the enemy. Sinclair was one of them, in conscience if not in criminal action. Sinclair saw his Utopian colony burned to the ground. He viewed it as a war, too.Oil! was written in the wake of the Teapot Dome scandal that scandalized Republican President Warren Harding and is loosely based on Edward L. Doheny, who made mega-millions creating an oil pipeline from Kern County to the Pacific Ocean, and was a major benefactor of the University of Southern California. USC is today thought of as a rich private school, satirized as the University of Spoiled Children. At least until recent years it was considered a conservative Republican institution producing most of the Richard Nixon and a lot of the Ronald Reagan Administrations. A great deal of jealousy, particularly from the liberal public school, the University of California, Berkeley, and the private Stanford University, both in the San Francisco Bay Area, has worked its way into the rivalries, oft-manifesting with socio-political imagery during halftime band programs. Much of this animosity stems from the image Sinclair paints of the fictional USC stand-in, Southern Pacific University.The university stands for everything he hates: elite wealth, arrogance, disdain for the poor, prejudice against minorities, particularly deserving Jews. A series of characters are introduced, much of it set against the background of the Red Scare. It is a no holds barred expose of radical thought, of anarchistic hatreds towards traditional America, of a desire to tear all the institutions down and replace them with revolution. Oil becomes the symbol of complete evil. Belief in God is anachronistic. The environment stands in for it.While much of this is predictable, the most telling part of the novel is its depictions of Bohemian culture within radical circles. Drugs and free sex are not merely pastimes, but part of a holistic political lifestyle meant to unshackle boundaries. In this we see the origins of the Beats, the 1960s drug era, the Summer of Love, the sexual revolution, and its political dynamics. The Communists used \\"free love\\" as an inducement to convert people to their cause, a fact that has been all-but forgotten in recent years, perhaps because AIDS and homosexuality made this dangerous.Ultimately, bribery and greed, inter-changeable with oil itself, tell the reader that capitalism and, in affect America, are corrupt and can only be cleansed by the sweet social reformers who are heroes of the book. It was made into a classic 2007 film, There Will Be Blood, starring Daniel Day Lewis, directed by Paul Thomas Anderson. The film changes the dates and diverts from much of Sinclair's political message, but still centers on the image of oil as greed and corruption. The movie's sound track and haunting themes, which includes the violinist Anne-Sophie Mutter with the Berlin Philjarmonic directed by Herbert vob Karajan, seems more than just \\"sinister\\" (which Anderson said), but rather depicts the strong sense of demonic sin; not just the main character (Lewis as Daniel Plainview) but Paul Dano, too, as a false prophet-preacher, souls headed down, down, down."},{"Title":"Oil! a Novel","review":"I purchased the audiobook version of 'Oil', because I remembered enjoying reading 'The Jungle' in High School.This was a good story, and even though it is set in Southern California in the 1920's the story largely transcends time.

Sinclair Lewis is a master of Americana schmaltz -- Upton Sinclair is not. His great strength is descriptive literature about man's abuse to other men for capitalistic gain.Upton Sinclair is the great scrivener of and for the working man, whose triumphantThe Jungleamazingly delivers the reader to the turmoil, pain and anxiety of the Polish immigrant laborers at the Chicago stockyards. The description of the workplace is amazing - so much so that the meat packing stench of the carrion and charnel houses seem to pervade from the pages. That book is a masterpiece. This book is not.This book is not the same. It is about a father and son who strike it rich as wildcatters in California and the wealth and adventure of the two as the boy grows older and father grows wealthier. But, the dialogue can bother you. As age creeps upon the two, some things evidence maturation - while others do not. For instance, after bedding a big time Hollywood actress for years, earning millions with dad in oil, watching graft and worker oppression on a daily basis, the 20-something son continually says to his father \\"Why . . . [do bad people do bad things to not so bad people]?\\" The innocence of the questions are okay from elementary school boys - not Hollywood sexing, veteran of WW I, college-educated, worldly traveled people: what the son is!But, the mixing of fiction with real world personalities always makes evocative reading - where you must ask: who is this character in real life. And, good fiction which intertwines with real world events can be great - thinkThe Godfather.But, of the 90 or so books written by this author, this is not his best. Not his worst, I am sure, but not his best. But, in the end it parallels the great The Jungle when he states, \\". . . an evil Power which roams the earth, crippling the bodies of men and women, and luring the nations to destruction by visions of unearned wealth, and the opportunity to enslave and exploit labor.\\"By the way: the cover says that this book is the source forThere Will Be Blood.

The movie and book are nothing alike and shouldn't even be compared to each other. As for the book...I really enjoyed the story pace and the characters towards the first quarter of the book. I really enjoyed following the lives of Bunny and his father for the first part of the book. Once I realized the kind of man Bunny was becoming I began to lose interest. While I may not be politically active in many ways, I do believe in certain fundamental ethics. As Bunny grows into a man I was just disgusted with him on many levels for various reasons. The only people I felt any level of sympathy for was his father and Verne.I can honestly say the only reason I finished reading the book was so I could see the downfall of Bunny. I won't give the ending away but I will say this; I would not recommend this book to anyone who believes the rewards for their hard work should be portioned out to those unwilling or unable to achieve the same level of success.Having said all that, from a purely educational perspective it was a very intriguing read. The level of government corruption that was simply accepted, the obvious civil rights infringements, and the historical backdrop all are very well written and something worth taking into perspective.I will say that I think it's a true testament to a writer to be able to create a character that readers can passionately hate. :)\\"The problem with socialism is that you eventually, run out of other people's money.\\" - Margaret Thatcher"},{"Title":"Oil! a Novel","review":"Much better than the movie, which was wonderful in its own way, and an interesting, though lefty, take on the early 20th century oil boom.

However, Fr. Dimock does a wonderful job of conveying deep truths and solid catechesis while remaining readable and accessible to the non-expert. Within the span of 101 questions, Fr. Dimock is able to cover a broad range of topics related to the Eucharist - from the history of the Eucharistic rites to the theology of the Mass to details regarding the architecture of Eucharistic tabernacles - while giving clear, orthodox answers to the most common (and some not-so-common but important) questions a Catholic may have. I especially appreciated the questions Fr. Dimock addresses related to non-Catholics and the Eucharist - can Orthodox or Protestant Christians receive the Eucharist at a Catholic Mass? Can Catholics receive communion at a non-Catholic service? These are issues that a typical Catholic often faces in our diverse culture, and this book gives clear answers to the most common questions in this regard.This book should be required reading for all RCIA candidates, as well as any Catholic wanting to understand the principal sacrament of their Faith more fully."},{"Title":"101 Questions and Answers on the Eucharist","review":"Fr.

It is the central ritual of Christianity. It is, therefore, very odd and perhaps tragic that the rudimentary aspects of this sacrament are not known or understood by most of the those who participate in it.\\"101 Questions and Answers on the Eucharist\\" by Giles Dimock responds to this deficit in knowledge in the way the previous twenty-one books in this series did. By taking the most frequently asked questions about the subject and responding in an easily intelligible way that's accessible to the non-expert. Father Dimock goes over the history and development of the sacrament, the theology behind it, the components and various forms of the Eucharistic Prayer (which most people daydream through), and other Eucharistic rituals.While I highly recommend this book, I can't give it the glowing praise that the two previous reviewers (and, coincidentally, fellow Marylanders) have given it. In the latter stages of the book, Father Dimock seemed to be steering the questions back to familiar themes and the responses started to sound repetitive. Also, very little attention is paid to the broad spirituality of the Eucharist and how consuming Christ's body and blood acknowledges Christ's presence within each individual while at the same time the community's sharing of the one loaf and the drinking from the one cup expresses the unifying aspect of the sacrament. Instead, an inordinantly large amount of space is devoted to participation among non-Catholics. It's an issue the book should address but not dwell on (also, no one ever seems to ask why someone who adheres to the doctrines and teachings of, say, the Lutheran Church would want to recieve communion in the Roman Catholic Church).Despite these minor complaints, I would urge anyone seeking a basic, yet comprehensive understanding of the Eucharist to read \\"101 Questions and Answers on the Eucharist.\\""},{"Title":"Confessions","review":"Okay, so I'm horribly sorry to disagree with you, Ms. Snyder--but I just LOVED Confessions.

In essence it champions South Africa's case for the region in which two critical developments occurred during our long journey towards modern homo sapienhood: the emergence of anatomically modern humans along South Africa's southern coastline some 200 000 to 100 000 years ago, and the suggestion that Sterkfontein may hold the key to a &quot;speciation&quot; event in which the ape men began taking on the morphological form of Homo some 2,8 million years ago.It's an absorbing read, pacy and well-written, giving the reader an insight not only into the detective-like quest for our oldest ancestors but also laying bare the intense and sometimes irrational competition between scientists seeking fame and fortune through fossil hunting."},{"Title":"In the Footsteps of Eve: The Mystery of Human Origins (Adventure Press)","review":"The story of hunting for human origins; not so much a general overview of human origin, it is primarily focused on the earliest time period, and on a few species and their relationship.

As a layperson, I didn't entirely follow the species relationships and geographical arguments, but the book was very illuminating about what it's like to do this work. I appreciate the author's skill at explaining what we don't know and why we don't know it, and the reasons why some of these things are so difficult to be sure about.But I nearly put the book down on page 19 when he claims that humans and chimps are more closely related then dogs and wolves.

It is all here: the gaps, the egos, the deceptions. I have been looking for a book that would simply state what was known about human evolution, not trying to persuade the reader one way or the other about how irrefutable the facts are. The author assumes there is enough evidence to back human evolution, though he does believe the model will change over time as more evidence is found. What I found compelling was how little solid evidence there is and the egos that control the flow of information. Berger paints a bleak picture of people being pressured to find \\"significant\\" fossils to keep funding coming. He shows how much disagreement there is about each finding among this small group of scientists that control the information coming out of Africa. He also recounts an amazing incident where he is strong armed, in a scene right out of The Godfather, into changing his description of a bone by a group of scientist that included Tim \\"Great White Shark\\" White, one of the two discoverers of the Lucy fossils.

My ears popped as I heard my wife read out loud (we alternated chapters) about the 10 million hand axes and other stone tools just south of Kimberley and the tens of thousands of hand axes, choppers, cores, and other elements further to the west, illustrating the success of the transitional archaic Homo sapiens that lived there about 100,000 years ago. A fossilized sand footprint from 117,000 years ago, clearly human, was another exciting discovery.Professor Lee Berger is another bold, brash, ambitious personality in the tradition of Broom, Tobias, Leakey, and Johanson. (He wrote in his diary, while still a graduate student, &quot;Watch Out Richard Leakey.&quot;) Yes, he is a bit of an unabashed self-promoter like the others but is so engaging about it that its easily forgiven and it makes the book even more enjoyable to read. Its all in a good cause -- to bring Australopithecus Africanus back as a contender as forerunner to H. habilis and H. sapiens and to push Johanson's &quot;Lucy&quot; off into the shadows. Whether he succeeds in redrawing our family tree or not, and the jury is still out, Berger has reinvigorated the detective story about human origins. Recent Out of Africa -- Yes! but from which part? East, or South?Four stars, not five. There were just not enough pictures or charts, especially for a National Geographic Book and far too many typos. Parts seemed altered in page proofs or &quot;rushed into print.&quot; Let's hope there's a great second edition soon."},{"Title":"In the Footsteps of Eve: The Mystery of Human Origins (Adventure Press)","review":"This book is an interesting book on Human Origins that shifts attention away from East Africa to South Africa. It makes one aware of the vital importance of South African discoveries in the field of paleoanthropology due to the abundance of remains, but points out some of the South African finds' problems as well, such as the difficulty in dating cave remains. Furthermore, Berger provides a nice history of South African Paleoanthropology.Berger also reminds those interested in paleoanthropology about the controversial nature of the field and places himself right in the middle of the controversies of the 1990s with his long arms - short legs theory. This theory is Berger's contribution to anthropological controversy and tries to remove the title of &quot;mother of all humankind&quot; from Lucy and perhaps place it in South Africa (and for sure suggest that earliest H. sapiens come from South Africa). However, here is where his main faults come forth. His chapters on the scientific and technical reasons that Africanus's limb proportions are of importance is sloppy and not convincing. Furthmore, he seems to have taken a real beating from Tim White (co-discoverer of Lucy) who attacks one of Berger's claims of finding a chimp-like tibia associated with Africanus. Berger writes that he survived and even perhaps won this battle, but Tim White seems to me to be the true victor.Moreover, there are plenty of typos in the book, which make reading less smooth than it ougth to be and there are way to few pictures and charts.Even with these flaws, I recommend the book to those interested in paleoanthropology already because it brings one up to speed on all the new finds and re-classification."},{"Title":"In the Footsteps of Eve: The Mystery of Human Origins (Adventure Press)","review":"From the keyboard of a amateur, this is an engaging and thoughtful book about a powerful and fascinating subject.

If you have any interest in the current scientific thought on human evolution, you must read this book!"},{"Title":"In the Footsteps of Eve: The Mystery of Human Origins (Adventure Press)","review":"Lee Berger and journalist Brett Hilton-Barber have written an engaging and concise overview of the main events in the discovery and interpretation of human evolution, including the obligatory personality clashes and disagreements. This sort of thing has been covered before in other books, but what is new and important here is the focus on the significance of the South African hominid fossils. One of the unfortunate side effects of the apartheid era in South Africa and the economic and intellectual embargoes imposed upon it was the loss, for so many years, of the knowledge of some of the world's finest hominid fossils. Unearthed and then locked away in vaults, they languished unstudied and undescribed for many years. For students of human evolution, this was literally an undiscovered country. This book is a compelling look at these fossils, and the intellectual journey that Berger embarked on in order to understand them.Berger chose to go to South Africa at a time when it was considered inappropriate for academics to be seen dealing with that country. He was fully aware of the potential consequences of such a move, including the possibility of being barred entrance to Kenya (and access to its fossils), but for an ambitious student, the attraction of working with original and often previously unexamined hominid fossils was too powerful to ignore. And, as this book clearly illustrates, Berger was nothing if not ambitious.There has been relatively little work published on the South African fossils since the 1950s (most notably some analyses on their functional morphology), so much of what we see in textbooks regarding them is based on rather old work. As a result, there has been a tendency to pay little attention to the South African material in the popular literature, compared to the accounts of the phenomenal fossils that have been found in East Africa. The fact that the geology and depositional history of the South African cave sites is so enormously difficult to interpret has only added to this inadvertent marginalization, because no absolute dates can be attached to any fossil using conventional radiometric dating techniques. Despite the difficulties, Berger is insistent that the South African hominids are important to our understanding of human evolution, and he is right.Much of this book is devoted to how Berger arrived at his interpretation of the sequence of early hominid evolution based upon the morphology of Australopithecus africanus, a hominid often assigned to a side branch in human evolutionary family trees. He postulates that A. africanus, and not A. afarensis (\\"Lucy\\"), is a direct human ancestor. Even if his particular interpretation remains open to question (there was much he did not mention about how hominid fossil relationships are determined), he has helped to confirm the suspicion that the road to the genus Homo is rather more complicated than once thought. The analysis of hominid postcrania (the skeleton from the neck down) has often shown a sequence of evolutionary adaptation that is discordant with what the study of skulls and teeth alone has suggested. Traditionally there has been a strong bias toward the analysis of craniodental remains to the exclusion of the postcranium, not the least because the former is far more abundant and taxonomically important. The trick is putting these sometimes-divergent lines of evidence together. Berger thinks he has an answer, but time will tell.The main problem with the book is Berger's rather large ego and sense of self-importance. It is plain throughout that his intention is self-aggrandizement, even at the expense of others, and therefore the attempt to portray himself as a disinterested academic/administrator trying to create the best department he can doesn't entirely ring true. There is a niggling sense that Ronald Clarke was not well treated; perhaps Clarke's fears that Berger would \\"take over\\" the Sterkfontein australopithecine skeleton were not unfounded, and Berger's ambition throughout is too apparent to really take his protestations seriously. Berger is out to make his mark in the profession, and make it fast. He also sets himself up as a David facing down the Goliath of scientific consensus, embodied in the form of Tim White and his team of researchers. This may make for good dramatic tension, but the fact is, no matter whose jet the White team arrived on, Berger was under no obligation to submit to an inquisition regarding his work. Most researchers are more than happy to discuss their published work with colleagues, so I sense a bit of descriptive overkill here.The other big complaint is that a copy editor apparently never laid eyes on the text: It is riddled with an inexcusable number of typos, misspellings of names (of both individuals and fossils) and generally sloppy or nonexistent editing. One wonders if there was pressure on Berger or National Geographic to get the book out fast, for some reason. Nevertheless, there is no doubt of the importance of the material from the caves of South Africa, and Berger has put forth some interesting and provocative ideas about how human evolution proceeded. If one can stomach the lack of polish and Berger's overriding ego, the book provides a valuable insight into an often-overlooked part of the human evolutionary story."},{"Title":"In the Footsteps of Eve: The Mystery of Human Origins (Adventure Press)","review":"Published at a timely point in the debate over human origins and lineage, this is a valuableitem. The idea of human origins in Eurasia has been long displaced. Not only is it clear thatour beginnings are in Africa, as Darwin suggested, but for many years the birthing site wasconsidered to be the Rift Valley. Just when view appeared to be well established, along comesthis Georgia rebel relocating our origins to southern Africa. Not satisfied with a geographicaldisruption, he snaps branches from the conceived evolutionary tree. He builds a convincingcase with smooth assurance. We might be sitting on that beach on the African coast where&quot;Eve's&quot; footprints were found, listening to him relate their importance in a bigger picture.He's a fine story teller. There are few flaws in this book, although some aspects aredisconcerting.The popular press, in dealing with anthropology, seems unable to shun the term &quot;missinglink.&quot; As a result, we continue to view each new fossil as filling some niche in a line stretchingback from me to some barely upright savannah dweller. Berger wants to dispel this fallacy,becoming our tour guide in the field and workroom as we examine evidence. He takes usthrough the history of 20th century paleoanthropology, beginning with Raymond Dart'sisolated South African Taung fossil. Originally spurned by British academics, Dart's chiefadvocate is one of the most colourful characters in the field, Robert Broom. In post-wareastern Africa, first the Leakeys, then Don Johanson's Lucy brought fresh assessments of thehuman family tree. Dating the fossil was the key issue - if you can accurately date the fossil,you can place it in the human lineage with some accuracy. South African paleochronology,however, is shown to be a dicey support. The fossils are often better, but their place in time iseasily, and readily, challenged.Continuous disputes over dating and body plans due to inadequate evidence kept resolutionof these academic controversies unattainable. Berger's own analysis of hominid bodystructure offers a solution. Johanson's Lucy, with her human-like proportions is pushed outof the linear family tree with southern African progenitors assuming her place. Berger doesthis skillfully, showing how arm/leg length ratios provide the key. His position is convincingenough for most of us, but not sufficient for those with a stake in the consensus view. TimWhite [the Great White Shark], once considered a hero for deserting the Leakeys forJohanson, appears here as a modern Torquemada directing an Inquisition against thisrelocated Georgian.Consensus, particularly in paleoanthropology, is a moving target, as Berger reminds us.Whether Berger's analysis of the human lineage achieves a new consensus remains to be seen.His proposal, which still rankles many, is that there are many branches in the tree, but manyof them proved sterile, producing no further offshoots. The picture left us is confusing, butlikely accurate. Berger's use of the term &quot;thornbush&quot; is innovative, imparting his comfort withhis adopted country. More importantly, it shows how inappropriate simplistic thinking iswhen considering evolutionary processes.While Berger was revising the human family tree, his own academic nest hosted a cowbird. Ameasure of Berger's qualities is his succession to the post held by Phillip Tobias, one of thepre-eminent figures in the discipline, at Witwatersrand University. Along with seeking fundsand other administrative duties, he fell foul of one the major figures in the field, Ron Clarke.Clarke, whose career at Wits can only be labeled checkered. Berger's tale of his dealings withClarke and Tobias can only be called sordid. In a book of this nature, it's almost embarrassingreading. A little search on the Web will bring up the relevant South African newspaperaccounts of the fray. The story has relevance, however, in buttressing Berger's role of SouthAfrica as humanity's point of origin.It's not an academic exercise to read this, although another encounter with the term&quot;postcranial&quot; may leave this reviewer gibbering. When an author starts rolling &quot;curved lateralcondoyles&quot; and &quot;rounded semi-membranous detachments&quot; in tibias [knee bones] past the reader,it's time for some diagrams. Berger's target for this book seems as much his professional, anddistant, colleagues as it is for the rest of us. We're unlikely to challenge his conclusions, sincethat's in the realm of the professional journals. His text is clear and informative. It's just thatwe foot soldiers need a little graphic guidance."},{"Title":"In the Footsteps of Eve: The Mystery of Human Origins (Adventure Press)","review":"To a large extent this is a personal account of Lee Berger's career. Dr. Berger leads a university department focused on human evolution at Wit in South Africa. The book includes a nice review of the current knowledge of human evolution with a focus on Austalopithicus. The current dogma has been that Lucy's species, or A.anamensis, is our ancestor. Lee Berger presents evidence and conjecture this may not be the case. There is review of what is and isn't known about the genus Homo and about archaic Homo sapiens. Dr. Berger presents his theory that modern man may have developed 130,000 years ago in South Africa. The politics of the community of scientist working on human evolution are discussed.

It is very easy to read, and makes sense of the jumble of conflicting theories about the ancestors of humanity. Whether or not Berger's theories hold water will depend on future fossil discoveries. One of his most exciting revelations is the description of an apparently complete skeleton discovered at Sterkfontein under rather strange circumstances by Ron Clarke, that is in the process of being excavated.This book is largely autobiographical, and provides some interesting (and controversial) insights into the weird and wonderful personalities who populate the world of paleoanthropology.My main complaint is that the book has the sloppiest example of editing that I have ever seen, which is astounding in a National Geographic publication. Apart from the fact that it cries out for more and better illustrations - photographs and drawings - there are an unacceptably large number of typos. I counted at least ten places in which text was repeated or left out.

The science appears to be correct, it's just the style that makes the book harder to read than it should be.

He affirmed that this novel is very imaginative and painstakingly thorough literature. From the many conversations and messages in the novel, it is clear that what is being celebrated is more Lee's specific accomplishments as a soldier than the example of his performance as Robert E. Lee. That performance reached what may be said to be its dramatic, reverant climax on July 12, 1863 when Lee became the man in a gray uniform while writing a letter to his wife Mary about the need for divine intervention. It fortunately became part of his permanent southern image. Mary read, \\"Our success at Gettysburg was not...great. In fact, we failed to drive our enemy from his position and have withdrawn to the Potomac. Had the river not unexpectedly risen, all would be well with us. But God in His all wise Providence willed otherwise... I trust that our merciful God, our only hope and refuge, will not desert us in our hour of need, but will deliver us by His almighty hand.\\" If ever someone writes a history of this army, they will cite this march as one of the great exploits of the Civil War. One may only imagine that Meade's spies informed the Union general that Mary Lee was home in Lexington, Virginia rehearsing \\"The Song of Miriam\\". Although according to the novel, at 11:50 pm July 2, 1863 the Major wonders if the Army of Northern Virginia was like the Egyptian Pharoah's army just before arriving at the Red Sea.

Fictional characters have always proved more adept at extricating themselves from tragic predicaments than their real-life counterparts and the authors' leaders of the Army of Northern Virginia are no exceptions. One can only imagine what Meade was doing and thinking by reading my favorite part of the novel that takes place at 11:45 pm, July 2, 1863, at Headquarters, Army of the Potomac, Gettysburg. To appreciate the excitement with which Meade's omission was received in Washington DC, it is necessary to understand how different it was from the purely offensive war plan that Union leaders had been anticipating for the few weeks after the July 1-3 battle. President Lincoln drafted a letter to General Meade on July 14, 1863 from Washington, DC. He wrote, \\"I do not believe you appreciate the magnitude of the misfortune involved in Lee's escape. He was within your easy grasp, and to have closed upon him would, in connection with our other late successes, have ended the war. As it is, the war will be prolonged indefinitely. If you could not safely attack Lee last Monday, how can you possibly do so South of the river (Potomac)... Your golden opportunity is gone, and I am distressed immeasurably because of it.\\" This masterpiece is a fictitious attempt to emphasize Lee's strategic genius at Gettysburg so to counter the recent scholarship of several military historians who have revisited the battle, to the detriment of Lee's reputation.

After a bloody, inconclusive first day at Gettyburg on July 1, 1863, Robert E. Lee had two choices. He could assault the Union forces on the high ground extending south of the Pennsylvania town of Gettysbury, or he could maneuver, slip around the left flank of the Union Army and look for a better place to fight a battle. In real life, Lee chose to assault the Union armies in place -- and lost. In this book, he maneuvers. He sends General Longstreet around the flank of the Union with most of the army in the hope that he will catch the Union army napping or confused.What makes the book good is the excellent and authentic descriptions of battle scenes and the portrayal of many characters, including Henry Hunt, the Union artillery leader, John Buford, the Union cavalry leader, \\"Ol' Pete\\" Longstreet, Lee himself, and Meade the Union commander. Battle heroes of real-life Gettysburg such as Joshua Chamberlain show up here too, but playing a different role. The authors are sympathetic to most of the major military figures in the book -- although there are a few villains too. The book never flounders on the shores of implausibility. Once can imagine that this alternative scenario might have happened had Lee made a different decision on July 1. The authors do a good job in maintaining the suspense as to who will win the climatic battle until the very end.

For whatever some people may have thought of Newt Gingrich in office, he's since certainly proven himself to be a fine novelist!David Rehakauthor of &quot;Love and Madness&quot;"},{"Title":"Gettysburg: A Novel of the Civil War","review":"I am not surprised Newt Gingrich is involved in this book.First, the Southern revisionist histories always concentrate on what the Lee and the ANV should or should not have done. Where was Stuart, what if Ewell had attacked Culp's Hill on the first day, etc., etc., as if the AOP and Meade were passive actors just waiting to be defeated by the right combination of Rebel moves. I concur with Pickett, who (maybe by attribution) is supposed to have said, when asked how the South lost the battle of Gettysburg, that \\"he thought the Yankees had something to do with it.\\"The AOP was at the peak of its operational and tactical capability in June-July 1863, marching hard, hitting hard and showing flexibility and initiative as an organization and in its leadership. The Union cavalry had reached parity with Stuart, and had, would and could beat them at the game of screen and scout, as they had from Brandy Station to Falling Waters. The AOP had the finest artillery in the world and the infantry, from Stannerd's 9 month Vermonters to the \\"Iron\\" Brigade would shock the Rebels repeatedly. Meade totally surprised Lee with the speed of his concentration on Taneytown. Between Buford's cavalry in the south (including Merritt's Reserve Bde), the recon forward by III Corps' US Sharpshooters toward Seminary Ridge the 2d morning of the battle and the Signal posts on the Round Tops, Lee's movement would have been exposed to Union observation. With little room to maneuver between Seminary Ridge and the Catoctin and South Mountains, Lee would have had to move his corps in a column of corps, the slowest method of movement for an army. Lee would have had to move as far south as Frederick to get around Meade's flank and the nearest good defensive ground between Frederick and Washington was closer to Meade than Lee. Delaying the battle as much as the three to seven days needed to reach good ground between Frederick, Taneytown and DC would have brought as many as 20,000 veterans and 20,000 militia into the AOP. Without Jackson, and with Ewell and Hill new to Corps command and a staff too small to manage three corps (remember how Lee assigned places in the grand assault on the third day to Hill's units without, evidently, he or his staff knowing their real combat effectiveness after their mauling by I Corps), the assumption of near flawless command by Lee is flawed in itself.The book doesn't work logistically either. Meade had switched his field depot to Westminster, between Baltimore and Gettysburg. He was drawing very little in supplies from the area to his south (through which he had marched and foraged on the way north). By the time Lee reached Frederick, Maryland Heights (Harper's Ferry) and its supplies would have been evacuated. When Lee began concentrating his army towards Cashtown on 28 June, he set for himself a timer. An army concentrated could not forage. The area he was moving into in the south had been stripped by the AOP on its march north. He had no more than seven days of supply (DOS) at full rations (in his haversacks and wagons), in which to bring the AOP to battle and destroy it as an organized force, so he could break down and forage again or he would have to retreat into the Valley and back towards his own depot at Williamsport. Almost all the food plundered in Pennsylvania had been shipped back.Lee attacked Meade where he was when he did on the 2d day of Gettysburg, because he did not have cavalry to screen his movement, his intelligence of the placvement of the AOP was wrong, his army was still streched from Cashtown to Chambersburg (Hill and Ewell would have had to disengage and move back over to the Hagerstown Road), and he could not support a campaign of operational manuever logistically. This book is as historically impossible as Scott Bowden's book was a hagiographic apologia for Lee at Gettysburg. It is a demonstration of the difference between amateurs and professionals."},{"Title":"Gettysburg: A Novel of the Civil War","review":"The character development and attention to geographic detail in the book was very well done. The first two-thirds of the book is quite plausible and engaging as historical fiction. Then it's one mistake after another by the Union generals, particularly Meade. The authors make too much of the personality conflicts between the Union generals, as if it would lead them to make suicidal decisions to try to prove that their rivals were wrong, which leads to disaster. The final battle is simply ludicrous.Quite obvious that this is yet another Southern attempt to glorify their actions in the Civil War, to make a case that if a few things had gone differently maybe the South would have won the war. In reality the South could never have won the war with all the factors stacked up against it.All wars are fought for stupid reasons, but the Civil War was one of the worst: to defend an institution (slavery) that had already been banned as immoral by the rest of the major powers of the time. Even calling it the War Between the States is revisionism -- it wasn't about States rights, it was about slavery.And we're considering this misguided dreamer as our next President?

Gingrich and Forstchen take the well known battle of Gettysburg and add some great twists.I won't rephrase what has been said in earlier reviews, you can get the general plot outline there. What I loved about this book is how the characters came alive in all their humanity...this is raw war, and it shows the reaction to war, the shock, the digust, the nerves, the vomiting, the loose bowels (sorry, but it is reality). This is not a caricature of heroes past, but showing them in all their honor, fear, glory, and humanity.I also found myself thinking a lot ....what if? What if Lee had flanked at Gettysburg instead of Pickett's charge? What if he had won a large battle south of Gettysburg and threatened DC while essentially destroying the Army of Potomac?

But when a side has over 2.5 million men going up against 1 million, they SHOULD win the war for crying out loud. The South had arguably better generals though... It shouldn't have even been a fight.

It sucks you in to its world so completly I was up until 2AM reading and could not believe what time it was when I finally got around to looking. Gettysburg portrays an alternate history where the South wins a major victory. I can't wait for the second book of this 3 part series to come out. Lee marching on Washington with U.S. Grant there to meet him. The geography described in the book is exact. I live about 2 or 3 miles from Union Mills and the pond and mill described in the book are still there. The Baltimore pike from Littlestown to Westminster winds up the steep hill the Confederates were entrenched on. Littlestown is about 1 mile from the MD line. Also just so everyone knows Tawneytown is pronouced corectly in the opening dialogue of the movie Gettysburg, everyone around here knows if you are a local or not by how you say that towns name and they actually get it right in the movie.Littlestown actually was involved in the real battle of Gettysburg in a small way: On The Morning Of June 26th A Band Of Confederates Entered Littlestown The Advance Of Early's Division, Ewll's Corps, The Army Of Northern Virgina, Which Were Crossing The Maryland Line Into Pennsyvania. On The Morning Of June 29th General Kilpatricks Division Of The Union Calvary Bivouacked For The Night Around Littlestown. Kilpatrick And General George Custer Both Lodged At The Barker House. The Next Morning In Union Mills Maryland, General Jeb Stuart Received Word From His Scouts That A Large Force Of Union Calvary Had Been Spotted In The Vicinity Of Littlestown , A Local Teenager A 16-Year-Old Herbert Shriver Volunteered To Guide The Confederates On A Detour Around Littlestown By WayOf Hanover. Stuart Did Not Know That Kilpatricks Forces Were Already On The Move To Hanover, General Kilpatrick Was Also Unaware Of Stuarts Detour To Hanover And Both Were Quite Suprised When They Clashed In What Was Known As The Battle Of Hanover....After Learning That Stuarts Troops Were Defeated At Hanover General Slocum's Corps Of 13,000 Infantry Entered Littlestown That Evening And Was Dispatched To Gettysburg The Next Day. General Sedgewick's Sixth Army Corp Of 15,000 Also Passed Through Littlestown On Thier Way To The Battle Of Gettysburg.After The Battle, Hundreds Of Wounded Soldiers Were Brought In Ambulances From Gettysburg And Placed On Railroad Cars At Littlestown. General Daniel E. Sickles Who Had Lost A Leg At Little Round Top During The Battle Of Gettysburg Was Among The Wounded Treated In Littlestown. Hanover by the way actually has a street named after JEB Stuart where a battle really did occur that Stuart lost. The authors must have visited the area personally to get everything so accurate. Anyhow buy this book."},{"Title":"Gettysburg: A Novel of the Civil War","review":"A small part of me screams out that GETTYSBURG is a transparent attempt by co-author and Southerner Newt Gingrich to immerse himself and readers from below the Mason-Dixon line in a fantasy consistent with the sentiment, \\"The South shall rise again.\\" And my first gut response is, \\"The Confederacy lost the war; get over it!\\" Having said that, however, I must go on to say that this alternative history of the events from July 1-4, 1863 is one of the two best works on the Civil War I've ever read, the other being that superb 3-volume narrative history of the conflict by Shelby Foote. The fact that Newt's GETTYSBURG is fiction makes it all the more remarkable.History has it that on Day 1 of the Gettysburg battle the vanguard of Bobbie Lee's Army of Northern Virginia drove lead elements of George Meade's Army of the Potomac from Gettysburg, the latter digging in on the hills and ridgeline south of the town. Lee's blood was up, and spent the next two days futilely attempting to take those heights against the advice of his chief lieutenant, General Longstreet, who advocated a flanking maneuver around the Union left. In GETTYSBURG, Lee not only bows to Longstreet's counsel, but goes one step further, sending his army on a wide right sweep into Meade's rear to capture the Union Army's supply base at Westminster and cut the Army of the Potomac off from Washington, DC. What results is the apocalyptic Battle of Union Mills on July 4.There are two things that make this novel so darn good. First, the characters of the commanders on both sides - Lee, Meade, Longstreet, Hancock, Sickles, Ewell, Heth, Hunt, Haupt, Sedgewick, Hood, Pickett, Armistead - and my own personal favorite, Colonel Joshua Chamberlain of the 20th Maine, seem to remain true to reality, or at least true to my perceptions of them gained as a casual student of Civil War history. Second, I suggest that you'll find no better description of battlefield conditions and the horrors of Civil War combat than that found here.There are two further volumes to this series, GRANT COMES EAST and NEVER CALL RETREAT. I intend to purchase both immediately and deliciously anticipate losing myself within their pages. I only regret that I'll have to put the books down occasionally to attend to life's relatively mundane daily activities.I'd award GETTYSBURG more than 5 stars if I could; it's off the scale."},{"Title":"Gettysburg: A Novel of the Civil War","review":"I am not a fan of Newt Gingrich but I was very pleasantly surprised at both the quality of the writing and the myriad of authentic details regarding not only the events surrounding the battle but of the nature of the two armies and of their commanders.As others of the reviewers have stated, this book is not for the casual reader of pop history but rather for civil war buffs who can appreciate all of the many details of the battle and its participants. With regard to other civil war buffs, like myself, we must actually suspend some knowledge of the nature of warfare during the period. As an only one example, the authors have an entire division of cavalry, under General Buford, completely disintegrate when attacked at a bridge over the Monocacy Creek. There is simply no record of a well-organized unit of similar size disintegrating during the Civil War. While Buford was (supposedly) killed, leadership would heve devolved on the senior Brigade commander and the unit would have retired while fighting a fierce holding action until relieved by other units of the Army of the Potomac.Grant the authors more than one of their dubious assumptions and you can (tentatively) accept the results of the final confrontation at Pipe Creek. Otherwise enjoy, as I did, finding those dubious assumptions which led these two dedicated southerners to postulate an alternative ending to the three days in early July, 1862, at Gettysburg, PA. I recommend it unreservedly to anyone thoroughly interested in the Civil War."},{"Title":"Gettysburg: A Novel of the Civil War","review":"If you've read and studied the Civil War classics (Catton, Foote, McPherson, Sears, etc.) you'll probably love this \\"alternative history\\" trilogy. Purists may dismiss the premise, but you may be won over once you realize that the \\"what ifs\\" are grounded in a deep understanding of the participants' strengths and weaknesses, the prevailing politics of the day, and other limiting tactical realities such as logistics and terrain. It is like applying war gaming theory to the past instead of the future. The result is not an entertaining fantasy but rather a deeper understanding of the key factors that decided a Civil War battle, as well as keener insights into the combatants themselves. At the outset I was skeptical of the overall concept of re-writing history, but I got hooked two-thirds of the way through volume one \\"Gettysburg.\\" Everything clicked for me when I saw how the authors handled \\"day three\\" of the Gettysburg campaign. After that I relished \\"Grant Comes East\\" and was totally immersed in \\"Never Call Retreat.\\" These books will stretch and extend your knowledge and understanding of the Civil War in ways that another non-fiction narrative simply cannot approach."},{"Title":"Gettysburg: A Novel of the Civil War","review":"In this novel, we get an accurate history of day one of the Battle at Gettysburg. The fighting, in day one was fierce and early on, the Union forces seemed to be getting the better of the action. However, General Reynolds was killed and shortly thereafter, the tide turned. By the end of the day, the Union forces were pushed back to Cemetary Hill. Although they took a beating, the positions they were pushed back to were defensible. From this point on, the novel departs from what happened and explores what might have happened. General Longstreet suggests to General Lee that the Confederate troops commence a flanking action and Lee acedes to this. So, rather than the head butting assaults in the Devil's Den and Little Round Top (and several other such skirmishes) Lee leaves a small force in front of the Union forces to bluff them while the bulk of his troops march off to positions between Gettysburg and Washington. The fierce fighting of the second day and the unsuccessful head on assault known as Pickett's Charge on the third day are averted.General Daniel Stickles sees what is happening and warns General Meade. Unfortunately, in a fit of anger, Meade admonishes Stickles and does not react in a timely manner. There is much confusion with the supply trains and General Haupt, who co-ordinated the railroads for the Union forces, fails to get proper cooperation from the locals. The trains are captured by the Confederate forces and as the flanking action continues, confusion reigns. The balance of the novel plausibly explores what would have occured in this situation. The authors assume just one major departure from actual events; Lee sees the error of attacking the Union forces head on when they have a defensible position on high ground. As in Chancellorsville, he divides his forces leaving enough at Gettysburg as a decoy while the others commence the flanking action. The outcome of this novel hinges on Meade's reaction to these events and the success of the Union forces in responding. This great saga continues with a sequel entitled \\"Grant Comes East.\\" I recommend this gripping alteranate history."},{"Title":"Gettysburg: A Novel of the Civil War","review":"Lee had the army of the south have trust and confidence in him and in them self that they could win the war but the cost in lives was to great a price to pay for a lost dream.

I must say that I was disappointed in the realism of the battles and strategy. Changing alternate history to make Southern Generals extra smart and making Northern Generals is NOT a concept for alternate history. It's more like a parody without humor. This could have been a good book and what ruined it for me was a plot that was just too far fetched. If you're a civil war buff and enjoy alternate history, I suggest reading \\"The Guns of the South\\" by Harry Turtledove. That book is miles ahead of this one."},{"Title":"Gettysburg: A Novel of the Civil War","review":"Newt Gingrich is a former professor of history and he knows our heritage well. He often uses historical events in his discussions of current political problems and did this successfully when he was Speaker of the House in the mid-late 1990's. It's clear that his love of history is something he effectively utilizes to tell his story- whether that is about current politics- or a battle fought long ago.In \\"Gettysburg\\", Gingrich hits on a subject that has fascinated history buffs for decades in exploring major battles which were turning points in our culture. It's clear that sometimes seemingly insignificant events have had important impacts on the outcome of major conflicts and allowed one side to prevail under what appeared to be improbable circumstances. In this historical mystery, Gingrich explores the Battle of Gettysburg- which but for a lack of timely information from Lee's cavalry commander Jeb Stuart could have resulted in a major victory for the South and a change in the balance of power in the United States. Many historians have discussed this great battle- one of the largest in the history of North America- and have speculated on whether Lee was fully in command (due to poor health), whether his top commander General Longstreet was right in wanting to do a flanking movement- and why Lee attacked in a questionable move right up the center in the desperate Pickett's Charge, which failed miserably.\\"Gettysburg\\" is interesting and entertaining in that it does a credible \\"what if?\\"- and this novel will be fun reading for all American history buffs, also for those who enjoy reading about major events in our past. The book is sure to provoke discussions for years to come- and that will be good.-Gene PisasaleAuthor, \\"Lafayette's Gold- The Lost Brandywine Treasure\\" and\\"Vineyard Days\\""},{"Title":"Gettysburg: A Novel of the Civil War","review":"I just finished reading all three books in the series. They are all very good, but the first one is the best because it is the most plausible. Lee's Maryland/Pennsylvania campaign begins as normal, with Stuart out of control, Ewell dragging is feet, AP Hill sick with syphilis and the methodical Longstreet preaching on the pulpit of \\"defensive\\" warfare. Heth's men go to Gettysburg to get some shoes, Buford's men block them, Reynolds and O.O Howard's corps come, get routed by Hill and Ewell's corps. The Union saves the ridges along Culp's Hill on the night of July 2nd, and anchors a very strong position. So far so good, right? However, this is where EVERYTHING changes, when the authors theorize that something called \\"Lee's Epiphany\\" takes place, where Lee comes to the realization that to attack the hills and ridges south of Gettysburg would be an exercise in futility and he would be better suited to do what he does best: maneuver around an inexperienced Union general who is hopelessly outclassed.Gettysburg is a book of curious \\"what ifs\\" that does not depend on improbable situations, introduction of future technology or privileged information (i.e., Lee's plans unexpectedly falling into the hands of the Union early in the Antietam campaign). Lee's sudden realization that he could out maneuver Meade; a former corp commander who was new to field army command, didn't know the components of his army all too well and was not well liked by his corp commanders; is a scenario that should have really happened instead of the self immolation of Pickett's Charge on July 3rd.Gingrich and Forstchen have clearly done their research. They have studied the character, personality and past actions of all the main characters and have accurately postulated the likely decisions that these leaders would make in critical, but fictitious, situations. Some of the thoughts and situations Gingrich and Forstchen have the major characters go through are: What would Meade do if he was cut off from Washington? How would Meade perform if he had to make a large number of strategic, campaign wide decisions in a chess-like battle of maneuver instead of a few \\"no brainer\\" tactical decisions that he made in the historical Gettysburg? Could Longsteet find the offensive aggressiveness to imitate Jackson? What would a Union \\"Pickett's Charge\\" be like? What would Lincoln and Secretary of War Stanton do if they couldn't communicate with Meade? These questions along with many more are asked and answered in a tightly woven yarn in breathtaking and lurid detail.PLEASE do not avoid getting this book because of the political views of the author. This may or may not be well known, but Gingrich has a PhD in History from Tulane University. At least in this book (and the other two books in the series), Gingrich is a historian first and never does any of his politics seep into the pages. If you are an avid fan of Civil War history, but avoid this book because of your prejudices against Newt the politician, without knowing Newt the historian, it will definitely be your loss."},{"Title":"Gettysburg: A Novel of the Civil War","review":"There are any number of alternative history books and articles that posit a Confederate victory at one point or another in the Civil War. Of course Gettysburg gets more than its share of this stuff, all the way back to Faulkner's famous assertion that all Southern boys imagine participating in Pickett's Charge, and imagine that they can change history, this time. Given that the authors are Southerners, and that this has been done before, I was, to be frank, somewhat apprehensive as I started this book, and the first 50 pages or so didn't dissuade me from my negative feelings.The authors, of course, are familiar with the lore of the battle as seen through the lens of the \\"Lost Cause.\\" One of the hoary old \\"truths\\" of Gettysburg is the Confederate claim that if Ewelll hadn't hesitated and ultimately flinched when faced with Cemetary Hill, he could have captured that height, and unhinged the whole Union position. In this book, Lee does that many neo-Rebs fantasize about: instead of issuing a vague discretionary order, he goes himself to Ewell's headquarters, and demands action, immediately. The attack goes in aggressively, as most Southerners think it should have, though things aren't perfect: the divisions are a bit uncoordinated.This is where things get interesting. I've always been of the opinion that Southerners and what I call the neo-Rebs are essentially overconfident with regards to this supposed \\"easy\\" attack. There were troops at the top of that hill, some who had been there for hours, fortifying, and artillery with extra ammunition. In this book, what I believe would have happened does: the Union artillery blows the Confederate attackers right off the hill, and the Union manages to hold the hill.This results in a council of war that evening in Lee's headquarters, and Longstreet speaks up, advocating his march around the Southern flank of the Union army. Instead of ignoring him (as he did in real life) Lee decides to go along with it, and further goads him by various references to Jackson, and how the fabled dead general would have handled the situation. The result, as you can imagine, isn't the same as the one that followed the actual battle.There are a few things that I found annoying or unrealistic or bad representations of people in this book. The authors (or their editors) mispell Robert Rodes' name repeatedly, and some of the characters act in ways that are uncharacteristic. I don't, for instance, believe that the manipulation attributed to Lee and recounted above would ever, in actuality, have occurred to the man, let alone seemed honorable enough to actually do. I did enjoy the depiction of the Union army generals, though. Hancock of course is seen as the backbone of the army. Henry Hunt is one of the main characters, a soldier very decisive in the actual Union victory at Gettysburg who is usually ignored. And old Daniel Sickles is better treated than he usually is, and frankly I don't think it's unreasonable. He's shown in the book as vain, arrogant, and disdainful of West Pointers, but aggressive, brave, and devoted to the Union, and lastly not quite the buffoon that others have thought him since, all accurate observations, far as I'm concerned.I enjoyed this book a great deal, and aside from the flaws above, I found it fun. It's not very well-served by the maps in the text (The Killer Angels did a better job of that) but besides that and the misgivings I put forward above, this is a very good alternative history novel."},{"Title":"Gettysburg: A Novel of the Civil War","review":"This book is amazing. Good read with great detail. A must read. Very detailed and shows what would happen if Lee took Gettysburg"},{"Title":"Gettysburg: A Novel of the Civil War","review":"This was a surprising book in many ways. Although alternate histories take many forms, this was written in such a way so as to facilitate a smooth transition from history as we know it to an 'alternate,' yet also, a most plausible version. Indeed, there was definitely a Killer Angels feel to the very beginning, but between the events of Day 1 and Day 2, the story flow was shifted to a different channel, so to speak. As a novel, this is quite entertaining, especially if you enjoy finding the alternate connections to historical facts and events. Interesting characters find their way into tale, as well: Captain Hubert Dilger (First Ohio Light Artillery, Battery I), Maj. Gen. Dan Sickles, and Maj. Gen. Abner Doubleday (cameo appearance, 1842 classmate of Pete Longstreet) are among the cast of lesser characters. Gen. James &quot;Pete&quot; Longstreet has a pivotal role, as one might suspect. Oh yeah, and Ewell finally got what he deserved.Last but not least, I have read few novels that successfully capture Robert E. Lee's moral character. This one did, which is a feat in and of itself.I heartily recommend this work."},{"Title":"Gettysburg: A Novel of the Civil War","review":"I started reading this book prepared to dislike it, based on a visceral suspicion of any hidden Confederate sympathies. I soon found I was wrong; the book by and large steers clear of any such agenda, at least overtly. This is a book that is a mix of very good and not so good.Start with the good. The degree of realism in the geography and the respective troop line-ups is admirable. The authors have built the story on a sound knowledge of the actual battle as well as the local topography (I live near the area and have visited it). The addition of the hand-drawn, back-of-the-envelope maps is a nice touch and also helps the reader get a mental picture of the troop maneuvers as well (though a scale map of the area probably would help as well). I particularly liked the way the authors treated strategy and tactics. One feels almost inside the heads of the key players as they strategize and review their actions. No punches are pulled either; at various points, Yankee officers are shown accusing their Confederate counterparts (and former comrades in arms) of treachery, General Lee himself muses (if all too briefly) on the rightness, or otherwise of his choices. Most of all this book can severely depress the reader with the sheer brutality and slaughter of 19th century warfare. Line charges against fixed positions supported by artillery were frequently the norm and would result in horrendous casualties, irrespective of the outcome. The authors, to their credit, do not soften this gory aspect and their descriptions can sometimes cause total horror. In the immortal words of the French General Bosquet on the Charge of the Light Brigade at Crimea just a few years before Gettysburg, \\"c'est magnifique, mais ce n'est pas la guerre!\\" (it's magnificent, but it's not warfare). And there are a number of nice touches, for instance Col. Joshua Chamberlain the hero of Little Round Top on the Union left flank with his 20th Maine at the actual battle, now get placed as a suicide rearguard on the Corp's right flank, where a charge by Pickett's Virginians sees him meeting up with none other than Brig. Gen. Lewis Armistead, the man who reached the \\"high water mark of the Confederacy\\" at Gettysburg!Now to the not so good. Alternative history must necessarily make key assumptions about what could have happened and the authors choice of assumptions here is weak i.e. General Lee, instead of the frontal assault at Gettysburg, initiates a flanking maneuver past the Union left flank, captures the Union supply base at Winchester, and forces Union General Meade to assault the Army of Northern Virginia's (ANV) strong defensive line at Union Mills, right between the Union army and Washington DC. Lee's obsession with Cemetery Ridge may have been bull-headed indeed, but time was not on his side at Gettysburg (remember he was in Northern territory with a long and vulnerable supply line). With his cavalry under Stuart playing truant, Lee had little idea of the disposition of the Army of the Potomac (AOP). Could the assumed flanking march to the left of the AOP at Gettysburg have been carried our unnoticed and free of counter-attack by Union troops? I suspect not. Particularly as the better part of the ANV would have had to march in a long column along one main road, with all the attendant gridlock and time that would entail. In fact, the key to Lee's flank movement in the book is that Meade, though warned by Buford's messenger, delays indecisively several hours for a staff meeting (in the middle of a battle!!), thus allowing the better part of the ANV to slip by his flank. Not too plausible I think.In any case, in alternative history, what matters is not the outcome of a battle but the implications of it and for this we must wait for the rest of the trilogy. One can hazard some guesses though. The Union victory at Gettysburg was critical for the North, but would a defeat have been mortal? Bear in mind that Vicksburg had just fallen, ceding control of the Mississippi to the North and sundering the Confederacy in two, probably a more severe blow to the South than a Union loss at Gettysburg. Could Lee have threatened Washington? Doubtful. Apart from the strong defenses around Washington, the AOP while badly mauled could still threaten his rear. He was deep in enemy territory with a tangled supply line. And the North's superiority in industry, manpower and logistics continued unchallenged. It will be interesting to see what the authors come up with in the second and third volumes of the trilogy.All in all, a good read: the authors have done well indeed."},{"Title":"Gettysburg: A Novel of the Civil War","review":"This book might be fine just for reading by someone with no clue to history.

What would have happened at Gettysburg if Stonewall Jackson had not been killed in a previous campaign and 2.) Would the Confederacy have won the war if Lee had won at Gettysburg? In this book, Gingrich and Forstchen set up a scenario of how Lee could have carried the battle in Pennsylvania, and set up two other volumes that carry the war to its conclusion.I found the book to be engrossing and well written. I can picture the authors standing over a topographical map of the area, saying \\"What if....\\" They seem to have a solid understanding of the weapons and tactics of the day and a grasp of the impact that politics and political interference had on both the Union and Confederate armies.

Forstchen. The book sat on my shelf for a couple of months before I decided to read it, at which point I took over the cover with ever bothering to look at it. Since I had missed all of the publicity for the novel, I actually started this book without knowing that it would turn into a \\"what if?\\" revision of the pivotal Civil War battle and finished it without being aware that it was the first in a trilogy, the second volume of which, \\"Grant Comes East,\\" is due out next month.Consequently, when on the night of July 1, 1863 General Robert E. Lee, commander of the Army of Northern Virginia, agrees with the suggestion of his senior corps commander, James Longstreet, that the Confederates pull away from Gettysburg and seek better ground on which to destroy the Union Army of the Potomac, I knew immediately that the authors were diverging from the path of history. My immediate reaction was that this would be interesting. Once of the problems with telling the story of the Battle of Gettysburg as a novel is that Shaara already won the Pulitzer Prize for doing so, and it is impossible to read the events of the first day of the battle without being aware of how Gingrich and Forstchen are stepping around Shaara's story of how John Buford's Federal cavalry delayed the Confederate advance long enough to preserve the lovely high ground at Gettysburg for the Union army and Henry Hunt's artillery.Up to the night of July 1 this novel sticks very close to what really happened. The only significant point of divergence that I really picked up on was that General Henry Hunt, Chief of Artillery for the Army of the Potomac, showed up on the battlefield on the first day and artillery to effectively stop the Confederate advance up Culp's Hill. Historically Hunt did not arrive on the battlefield until late that first night, having been ordered earlier that evening by General George Meade, the newly appointed commander of the Army of the Potomac, to move the artillery reserve to Gettysburg.Hunt's presence is crucial to changing the calculus for Lee, because adding all that artillery to the equation at the beginning of the battle makes it clear to the Confederate commander that Gettysburg would be another Malvern Hill for his army. Lee mission in taking his troops into the North was not just to get supplies but also to destroy the Army of the Potomac in a last concerted effort to voice President Abraham Lincoln to the peace table. Vicksburg is on the verge of falling to Ulysses S. Grant in the West and unless Lee can win a decisive victory in July 1863 the industrial might and flood of immigrants in the North will make a Union victory inevitable.I like how Gingrich and Forstchen play out their alternative battle. The ground for the decisive battle is obviously not as well known as the famous terrain of Gettysburg, but a string of roughly drawn maps are provided to give us a sense of the geographical situation. But basically what the authors appear to be doing is to provide a scenario that produces Pickett's Charge in reverse. However, you can never be absolutely sure that is what is going on here and you have to be open to the possibilities.As with any alternative history Gingrich and Forstchen are often tempted to include bits and pieces of what really happened into their narrative. For example, Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain (called Joshua in an apparent attempt to carve a figure somewhat different from the one glorified in \\"The Killer Angels\\") still wants his brother Tom to be stay away during the battle because if they both get hit by a shell \\"It will be a hard day for Mother.\\" Those familiar with Chamberlain's distinguished career after the defense of Little Round Top on the second day at Gettysburg will notice that a key moment from later in the war is transposed to this point in time.Ultimately the battle being played out here is more important than the characters. The Lee of this novel is a mixture of piety and anger that I have not come across before, and there is clearly a sense in which it is the heroism of the troops rather than the quality of their commanders that matters in the battles. Now that I know that this story extends for two more books I have to reconsider the military figures that Gingrich and Forstchen are removing from the board (a number of generals who survived the real Gettysburg are killed before the end of this volume) as well as those being tapped for future prominence. Hunt is clearly one of those and so is the politician turned Union general Dan Sickles.I thought the ending of the novel allows it to stand on its own. By no means is it determined who is going to win the war at that point, making \\"Gettysburg\\" an inkblot in which anybody who wants to see the Confederacy winning the war can draw that conclusion and those who want to continue believing in the inevitability of a Union victory can see evidence to support that position as well. It is too early to be able to determine what ultimate point Gingrich and Forstchen intend to try and make with their alternative history, but I am sure there will be one, just as there was with Harry Turtledove's \\"Guns of the South.\\" Therefore, judgment needs to be reserved on that score until the trilogy is completed."},{"Title":"Gettysburg: A Novel of the Civil War","review":"The first volume covers the battle of Gettysburg, though with strategic maneuvers beyond anything contemplated by the actual participants. Like any successful counterfactual history, the authors are careful in their initial changes - in fact, most readers will not even be aware of the changes in the battle to after the end of the first day's fighting, but by this point many small changes have already occurred - enough changes in fact to lead Lee to a strategic masterstroke on a par with Jackson's Chancellorsville march. From here the story rapidly diverges from what we know as history, but never beyond possibility, and it's amusing to see various participants like Sykes, Sickles, Joshua Chamberlain and others perform in this parallel universe.The battles scenes are excellent and provide a closeup look at the experience of individual troops. They note often how the opposing sides would arrange unofficial truces when the battles end. You'll probably suspect that the climactic battle of the second book won't resolve everything since there's still that third volume! But that never subtracts from the tension & suspense of these books. Great history - my only regret is that Gingrich didn't start writing novels earlier, rather than spending so much time fighting other battles in Congress."},{"Title":"Gettysburg: A Novel of the Civil War","review":"Newt Gingrich as novelist? Revolutionary? Sure. Ideologue? You bet. Philanderer? Probably. But novelist? Surprisingly enough, Gettysburg turns out to be one of the best alternative military history novels I've read in ages. Sure, the &quot;what if Lee had one at Gettysburg?&quot; is the oldest cliche in alternative history but Gingrich and Forstchen have turned in a winning variant. After day 1 at gettysburg, Lee is persuaded by Longstreet to pull out and do a long march around Meade's flank to get astride Meade's line of communications with Washington. It is Second Manassas all over again. I will refrain from any additional spoliers, except for noting that Westminster, Md., burns. As someone who went to college in that burg, I always thought it could stand a good burning!The writing style is clear, if a bit MTV-ish in its rapid scene cuts, and maps make the action easy to follow. (Harry Turtledove, please take note of the utility of maps!) It's impossible to know how much credit to give Gingrich as opposed to Forstchen (or a third contributor, one Albert Hanser, who is identified merely as a &quot;contributing editor&quot;). But it works, which is what really matters. The old cliche &quot;un-put-downable&quot; is really true here -- I stayed up until 1:30 am reading it.This is the first book in a planned trilogy. The obvious comparison is with Harry Turtledove's civil war series. (Not Guns of the South, which is entirely separate, but rather the series that started with &quot;How Few Remain.&quot;) Its been pretty easy to spot where Turtledove is going: he's just rewriting the First and Second World Wars on American soil. In contrast, it is hard to tell where Gingrich and Forstchen are going. In real history, the North had such an overwhelming superiority in manpower, industrial output, and railrod lines that the South had no real chance. All Lincoln had to do was find a general who &quot;understood the mathematics.&quot; Gingrich and Forstchen clearly know this: several characters make reference to these advantages at several points in the novel. But why write three books of alternative history to get to the same point as real history -- a Union victory -- by a different route? Anyway, it should be an interesting ride."},{"Title":"Gettysburg: A Novel of the Civil War","review":"This book is ranks as one of the best alternative history books I have read. It is as good as any written by the greats in this field such as Harry Turtledove and Harry Harrison. As an amature historian and reenactor, I have studied this war quite a bit and always enjoy pondering \\"what ifs\\". This book is based on a very possible senerio unlike \\"Guns of the South\\". While \\"Guns of the South\\" was a very entertaining book it had little basis in what might truly have been possible. Mr. Gringrich and Mr. Forstchen did their home work on this book. They created a very possible senrio rooted in historically fact and brought it to life.

In discussing the battle with other enthusiasts, we have often gone over \\"what if\\" scenarios and have played them out with table-top and computer simulations. This story takes a strategic theory and brings it to life with the historical characters."},{"Title":"Gettysburg: A Novel of the Civil War","review":"...my usual aversion to the fictionalization of history. I am generally afraid that sources of information are forgotten, but that the information may be retained and taken for fact.Now, assuming you're not going to fall into that trap, this is a piece of great historical fiction. Whether it was Mr. Gingrich or Mr. Forstchen who actually put pen to paper I do not know, but the writing is wonderful and flows beautifully.The history is basically accurate through day 1 at Gettysburg, when Confederate forces made the error of attacking fixed and fortified Union positions on the high ground around the town.This was almost the mirror image of the error Burnside had made previously at Fredericksburg. No doubt the rules of how to wage war were fast changing. What these professionally trained leaders on both sides (almost all West Pointers) had learned from their texts and from the Mexican War 20 years earlier needed to be updated by the recent changes introduced by the rifle and by the trench, not to mention by the improvements in artillery. (the same lessons were still taught for decades after the Civil War and explain in part the horrific losses in WWI caused by the storming of trenches whose occupants were now armed with machine guns)It is on the fateful second day the book largely departs from the history. It has Longstreet convincing Lee of the wisdom of not attacking uphill again, but instead of making a great flanking march behind the Union left and into their base of supplies, inserting themselves in the process between the Army of the Potomac and Washington. The outcome, while fictional, seems in fact quite plausible. Would newly appointed commander Meade have reacted quickly enough to counter such a move, especially in the presence of a feint from Confederate cavalry General Stuart coming from the opposite quarter of the battlefield? The answer is unknown, but it is certainly an intriguing proposition.I am absolutely certain that anyone who enjoys the study of our second national immersion into a great crucible of fire will find this bit of fiction irresistible.

It shows the reader what would history would have looked like if this had accured leading to the 20th Miane failing to protect the Union armies flank, and how infighting amoug the Union generals esp between Meade and Sickles lead to a massave Union defeat. However the book does show how this event would not have sapped the will of Lincoin to continue the fight in fact it makes him decide to make Grant overall commander of all Union forces in the field much to the suprise of CSA leadership.

The result couldn't have turned out any different. I looked south, towards Washington, there had to be a place down there where Lee could find a hill for the Union to have to charge. Lincoln wouldn't have let the Army of the Potomac not attack.I looked, I thought, I didn't do anything about it.Newt Gingrich and William Forstchen looked at the same situation and researched it some more. They found that Meade had really wanted Lee to attack him at Pipe Creek. They found that Longstreet had told Lee that going around to the south and letting Meade attack them, but was overruled.==Then instead of forgetting it, they wrote a book where Lee responded to Longstreet with an &quot;OK, let's do that.&quot; -- Excellent reading, obviously this is the first of a series.

This book confronts the possibilities of what MAY have happened if a few decisions had been decided the other way and is certainly a fascinating framework out of which spring many more potential hypothesis. The personal sagas woven into the battlefield narrative were necessary to make the points and keep it interesting to the non-military historian reader. But some scenes, indeed, seemed contrived and based on well-known and obvious facts. Others were the products of legend that are rarly, if ever, provable by known facts. But overall, the battlefield scenes were compelling, real, and well-rounded.The book went to great lengths to avoid political commentary that would subject it to being criticized for leaning one way or another, and to me, this was somewhat of a disappointment. Perhaps Gingrich will delve into these issues in the coming volumes as they are compulsory when discussing the battlefield decisions that were made.Overall, it was an extremely interesting book and well-grounded in reasonable inferences from what we know happened on those hot July days in 1863.

The book, an alternate history view of Gettysburg where Lee decides on a flanking action rather than a direct assault, is excellent. I don't think it's quite as good as \\"Killer Angels,\\" but it's close.I don't know how much of this was written by Gingrich and how much by Forstchen, but I definetely saw many Forstchen touches, especially in the secondary characters and in the battle scenes. I will almost certainly give the two sequels a try. And for the readers who liked this, you should have a look at Forstchen's \\"Lost Regiment\\" series.

Forstchen's tenth book in his \\"Lost Regiment\\" series now can know what he's been doing since 1999. He is the primary author of \\"Gettysburg: A Novel of the Civil War.\\" His co-author, former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, gets top billing, of course. But ol' Newt has added his name primarily to sell the volume. (Gingrich implies as much in an interview published in the most recent issue of \\"North and South\\" magazine. He also does most of the talking in a History Channel feature program on the book.) The book is clearly Forstchen's, though, with the flavor, pace, passion and intense detail characteristic of his nine \\"Lost Regiment\\" stories. Characters are fully developed, if somewhat idealized. Action scenes are clear and intense, if at times a bit over the top. And there is a perpetual rush of movement throughout the prose that keeps one eagerly turning the pages. Forstchen fans will love \\"Gettysburg.\\"There are a few annoying distractions. A lot of familiar names from the original (which is to say real) battle seem to die in this version. The author(s) also unfortunately surrender without qualification to some of the worst prejudices regarding key leaders on both sides, particularly generals Ewell and Meade. And there is a tendency to overuse superlatives when describing a character's passion for the cause, whether Union or Confederate.All-in-all, though, it is a great read. It does not quite supplant Michael Shaara's classic \\"The Killer Angels,\\" but it comes darn close. The hard copy edition includes some \\"back of the envelope\\"-type maps. But to truly follow the action, one should keep handy a good (hopefully period) map of the ground between Gettysburg and Frederick MD. (This reviewer used the map board from Avalon Hill's old \\"Roads to Gettysburg\\" game. It had virtually every hill and building cited in the book.)Gingrich says he and Forstchen are writing \\"action history\\" that lets the reader really feel the tension and dynamic inherent in critical decisions and events of the past. So, they wrote a story that \\"lets Lee be Lee.\\" In other words, General Robert E. Lee does not become fixated on Cemetery Ridge as he did historically on July 1, 1863, but rather adopts a strategy of maneuver that ends with the South decisively winning the Gettysburg campaign. The result of the effort is a truly fascinating exploration of what if. Now, instead of \\"Lost Regiment\\" number ten, this reviewer awaits two more volumes by these authors which are to explore what a Southern victory might have meant."},{"Title":"Gettysburg: A Novel of the Civil War","review":"Speculating about the \\"what ifs\\" in military history is always an engaging -- if somewhat fanciful -- pursuit. And few do it better than the Gingrich-Forstchen collaboration in this well researched, alternative account of the Battle of Gettysburg.In a nutshell, Lee heeds Longstreet's advice -- and does it one better. Rather than engage in a direct frontal assault, he opts for speed and maneuver, the traits that served him and Jackson so well at Chancellorsville and Second Manassas. The Army of Northern Virginia captures the Union supplies at Westminster, MD, and takes the high ground between Gettysburg and Washington, DC, inviting Meade to attack. The ensuing collision is the real Gettysburg in reverse: Longstreet entrenched on the high ground and Meade compelled into reckless, suicidal charges across open fields.Some of the principal actors are portrayed true to form, while others take on new, enhanced qualities. For example, Longstreet is somehow imbued with Jackson's daring and audacity, and is rewarded with the defensive engagement he has always coveted. Conversely, Ewell retains his true-to-life, post-Manassas timidity. Throughout, Meade is cautious almost to the point of paralysis, and with a few notable exceptions (Hunt, Sickles, Hancock), the entire Union High Command is uniformly incompetent.\\"Gettysburg\\" is a page-turning work of historical fiction that will be enjoyed by many readers, even those with limited Civil War knowledge.

I recommend it!"},{"Title":"Gettysburg: A Novel of the Civil War","review":"In the annals of literature, the historical novel has deep roots: There are scores written about the American Civil War alone, most notably Stephen Crane's The Red Badge of Courage (1895) and Margaret Mitchell's Gone With the Wind (1936). Lately, though, a somewhat new category has emerged, \\"what if\\" historical fiction, that offers a look of what may have passed had events unfolded differently. Its best example is Robert Harris' Fatherland (1992), which is based on the chilling premise of life in 1960s Germany had the Nazis won World War II. Fatherland represents this genre's best because its themes go beyond the specific turning point of its \\"what if\\" plot. It is not important because it's predicated on the Nazis winning D-Day; rather, its significance lies in the story of an SS officer's journey from idealistic soldier to disillusioned father, and how he sacrifices himself in order to teach his son a lesson about fidelity to truth above regimes.Its significance lies in the historical lessons it illuminates.Philosopher George Santanyana proclaimed, \\"Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.\\" Former Speaker of the House and co-author Newt Gingrich has a somewhat more malleable view of history when describing how he and military historian William R. Forstchen (who did most of the writing) approached \\"Gettysburg\\": \\"We...have learned that when you reduce history to passive memorization, you lose people,\\" Gingrich remarks. \\"We embrace the concept of an active history: \`In a particular situation, what would I have done?'\\"Thus does the battle of Gettysburg -- which was fought in the humid and sweltering heat of the Pennsylvania Dutch country in July, 1863 -- unfold anew. Its underlying premises are: \\"What if Gen. Robert E. Lee fought Gettysburg differently? What if he listened to the counsel of his generals to take a defensive posture, in particular, Gen. James Longstreet? What if the Confederacy won Gettysburg, how would they have done it?\\"That's a pretty tall order. Personally, I couldn't imagine the South winning Gettysburg without Gen. Thomas \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson, the brilliant Confederate tactician whose exploits in the Shenandoah Valley campaign alone rank him as the greatest military mind this country ever produced. Unfortunately, that couldn't have happened, since Jackson was wounded by friendly fire at Chancellorsville, and died shortly thereafter of infections that ravaged his body.Instead, Gingrich and Forstchen serve up quite an audacious alternative version of events: Using the same cast of characters (Generals Lee, Longstreet, Stuart and Pickett for the South; Generals Meade, Reynolds, Hancock and Hunt for the Union), they manage to correct the mistakes from one side (the Confederacy), while maintaining the pecadillos of the other (the Army of the Potomac) in order to turn the tide for the boys in gray.This is one of the most well-researched historical novels I've read in a long time. Forstchen, Gingrich and their contributing editor, Albert S. Hanser, have culled an amazing amount of factual data about the personages involved, their personal lives, the terrain in the theater of operations, the weaponry, troop movements and various miscellany that give the reader an unmistakable \\"you are there\\" feeling. The battle scenes are bloody, brutal, and spare no realistic detail to assuage the squeamish. \\"Gettysburg\\" is an engrossing and entertaining read, and I recommend it highly to both Civil War buffs and students of military battle.Ringing endorsements stop there because, for all the authors' insights into battle, historical minutiae and command leadership, there is little else to intrigue the reader. While it notches the action up to Schwarzenegger levels, its dialogue is stilted, but nevertheless on a Grand Scale. When the leadership (particularly of the Dixie persuasion) stop to think, they do so in Deep, Grave, Philosophically Reflective and Platitudinous thought balloons worthy of the School of Athens, as ornately etched by Michelangelo, or Rembrandt.And this is the book's major fault: In elevating its Confederate heroes to the level of their legends (and, conversely, in bringing down its Union nemeses to their cynical worst), the authors sweep under the rug their protagonists' human faults and failings (which were the cause of the CSA's defeat). It's easy not to be condemned to repeat history when it's re-enacted by demi-gods, not real men with real limitations.There is also scant evidence of Gettysburg's implications for the trebling effects on the state of a divided nation. What shall become of slavery? The Constitution? Will the Union be forever split into two? What of Lincoln's fate? \\"Gettysburg\\" offers slim pickings for those whose minds might meander away from Devil's Den or Seminary Ridge.This novel could have been Novel. Instead, the authors kept it at the technique-bound level of an intellectual exercise, sort of like replaying the Bobby Fisher / Boris Spassky chess matches. The most important historical lesson learned from \\"Gettysburg\\" is that hindsight is 20/20. Big deal.Of course, I may be opining too soon, as \\"Gettysburg\\" is the first installment of a proposed trilogy. Weightier questions may indeed be answered in future tomes. For the time being, it leaves me -- (after trudging through more than 450 pages of dense prose and stately cogitation) - haunted by Miss Peggy Lee's famous query: \\"Is That All There Is?\\"Among novels of the \\"what if\\" genre, this thoroughgoing but ultimately trifling opus brings to mind a constant rejoinder often voiced by Gingrich's pal, Rush Limbaugh (albeit, in different contexts):\\"If is for children.\\""},{"Title":"Gettysburg: A Novel of the Civil War","review":"I have been to Gettysburg and read about it many times.

Likewise, minimizing the critical role Meade played, having just taken command three days earlier, is utterly ahistorical, given his solid performance throughout the campaign. And then to turn the charlatan Dan Sickels into the Union hero is just ludicrous. Willing suspension of disbelief is the trick. This novel, however, requires complete suspension of disbelief. To make a novel like this work, what the characters do must be possible within the historical context. That simply is not the case here. What happens in this book is NOT plausible. Plausible would be a Confederate sniper killed Gen Warren before he could call for reinforcements to defend Little Round Top. Or let Lee give his discretionary order to Ewell on the evening of the first day, but this time let Ewell have been shot in his other leg so that Jubal Early, now commanding the Second Corps, would drive home the attack. Or allow that Henry (I mean General Hunt--how crass to call a general by his first name throughout a book) wasn't able to replace his batteries quickly enough so that Pickett's Charge did succeed. Now those things \\"could\\" have happened. Finally, I still get annoyed with all the revisionist drivel that spews endlessly from the pens of unreconstructed Southerners. You fought a war for the worst of all possible reason, to preserve slavery--oh, I'm sorry, I mean for the right of states to preserve (and extend) slavery. And then you did get your butts whipped badly. Your society was destroyed and relegated to the ash heap history. I know, tough love is tough. And us Yankees still love you because we know, that to some extent, you just can't help yourselves. But when Newt turns out this swill (Heck, he calls Hunt Henry, so I can call Mr. Gingrich Newt), I gotta fire back. Bottom line: rebel pablum for fluffy, uncritical minds who (a) may know the what but not the why of Gettysburg and (b) still long for the return of Dixie.

Yes, I know--apples and oranges. Killer Angels was history with creative license. This is \`what if' history. So what? It's a jaw-dropping read.As a Yankee, I was somewhat disconcerted by how the first episode, Gettysburg, ended. How could Lee not only win at Gettysburg--but win a battle of annihilation? One simple \`what if' premise underlies the story--and it is a plausible premise. At the end of a victorious Day One, Lee orders a suicidal assault into Henry Hunt's massed artillery on Cemetery Hill. It fails and Lee, in essence, has snatched defeat from the jaws of victory. But Lee is stubborn and plans a follow up assault the following day.Longstreet objects and proposes a flanking movement. Lee admits that his judgment has been clouded by his obsession with a battle that would destroy the Army of the Potomac once and for all and end the war. He agrees and the flanking movement by Longstreet results in Lee occupying the ground at Pipe Creek that Meade had preferred as his own defensive position.With Washington howling for Meade to attack, he panics and orders the entire Army of the Potomac to attack a position even he believes is impregnable.

Excellent insight into the various personalities."},{"Title":"Gettysburg: A Novel of the Civil War","review":"This is a novel about what might or should have been an alternative Gettysburg history. From the very beginning everything makes perfect sense, with Robert E. Lee taking personal charge of the final events of the first day's battle (which he should have done anyway after a reorganization of the ANV)and forces the final assault on Cemetery Hill. Even today historian disagree as to whether it would or would not have been successful.In this account the assault fails and Lee realizes that Gettysburg is not the place to fight. But instead of following Longstreet's suggestion of a flanking assault around the Round Tops, Lee thinks like the bold strategist history has painted him and executes a wide flanking maneuver forcing the Army of the Potomac to fight on Lee's terms and is a position of Lee's choosing.Everything makes perfect sense in retrospect for a grand tactical maneuver worthy of Lee. The problem comes in, in that the authors do not quite know how to stage the final battle of Union Mills (Pipe Creek). It seems unlikely that Meade and his generals would have been so rash as to their final plan of action.The novel is interesting and follows the day by day thoughts of the principal characters, Lee, Longstreet, Meade and Hunt. Choosing to view events thorough Hunts eyes is a bit odd as he is not what you would call a pivotal character of the historic Gettysburg. Hancock would have been a better choice as he did figure more prominately in events. There are other minor characters on the Confederate side that simple take up reading space and have no real bearing on events.That said this is a perfectly logical development of the way the Gettysburg Campaign should have, or could have played out and is an enjoyable read and worthy of having in the collection of the Gettysburg historian."},{"Title":"Gettysburg: A Novel of the Civil War","review":"I know alot of people would be turned off of this book solely based on the author, I was for a bit myself.

Just as full of struggles and suspense as the real battle was.Such it will never win many literature awards but parts of it are a darn sight better than what passes for alternative history currently.Two things annoy me and keep this book from getting a perfect rating.1. The lack of a descriptive vocabulary the word \\"Oppressive\\" was used to describe heat on no less than 15 occasions in the course of this book, I know because I counted. It was wasn't just about the description of the heat, this happened a lot.2.

Definitely it SCREAMS for a sequel.Alternate history that follows closely true history with a key change is a treasure to find. Gettysburg is a great example of such a book...I'd love to see more from this winning team of Gingrich/Forstchen! If ONLY they would write a novel based on the moment that General Winfield Scott asked Lee to head the Union Army, and Lee said he'd think about it...when he submitted his resignation, Scott told Lee he was making the biggest mistake of his life. What if Scott had talked him into it and Lee had joined the Union instead of the Confederacy? That's a book I'd love to see. (I'm writing this in case Gingrich and Forstchen ever read the reviews of this book!)Anyway, you cannot go wrong with this book.

It masterfully brings to life what could have been a very different outcome to what many consider to be the pivotal battle of the Civil War. Anyone even the least bit familiar with the actual battle will appreciate the authors' deft handling of the real-life characters and situation.The book's true worth lies in how convincingly this story is told, which is a testament to the authors' grasp of the subject matter. It is so well written, in fact, that someone who is totally unaware of what really happened at Gettysburg during the summer of 1863 - and who fails to read the dust jacket - could just possibly mistake the book for an actual history. However, that believability is precisely what makes this alternative history novel so valuable. It would be a very worthy addition to the library of anyone interested in the Civil War.Michael A. Davis"},{"Title":"Gettysburg: A Novel of the Civil War","review":"When writing a \\"what if\\" it is necessary by implication to alter the scenario while keeping the story within historical realism. In this book the authors have done a very good job but in certain respects have gone a little too far. For example they have altered Lee's personality from the tired, uninspired fatalism of Gettysburg to a dynamism that closely resembles Jackson. Perhaps this is necessary as it is no coincidence that with Jackson the Army Of Northern Virginia never lost a battle and without him never won one. That said this is an exciting and well written alternative history and well worth a read."},{"Title":"Gettysburg: A Novel of the Civil War","review":"The former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich has teamed with a history professor William Forstchen to craft an alternative fictional view of the Civil War. After they lay out the historically accurate first day events at Gettysburg, they slip into a hypothetical view. This is what could have happened if Lee had listened to those near him, who knew that fighting an offensive battle on ground chosen by the Union was a losing proposition.In this version, Lee sends Ewell, Pickett, and Longstreet on a vast flanking march into northern Maryland on day 2 of the Gettysburg campaign. In reality Lee sent Pickett into the center of the heavily defended Union lines where his corps was anihilated. Only one man survived Pickett's charge and reached the Union lines.The rebels are then able to control several Maryland towns including Emmittsburg, Tawneytown, and the railhead at Westminster, and to capture huge quantities of badly needed Union supplies. Longstreet then turns the tables on history, by setting up a defensible position along a Maryland creek.As the rebels are now behind the Union lines and between the Army of the Potomac and its capital, Mead is determined to attack, at any cost, in spite of overwhelming odds and poor fighting ground. Mead is routed, Lee outflanks the retreat and the Army of the Potomac appears doomed.Of course, Lincoln won't give up so easily. Remnants of the Army of the Potomac escape across the Susquehanna, regroup under new commanders, and Lincoln summons US Grant to the Eastern front (but that is volume 2 of this trilogy).Like me, Newt Gingrich is from central Pennsylvania; although he later moved to Georgia and achieved some notoriety there and in DC. The Speaker is familiar with Gettysburg and the role of the Pennsylvanians who fought there, including Generals Reynolds and Mead. Gingrich clearly thinks that the rebel leadership was superior in character, integrity, and intellect to that on the side of the Union, and he might be right about that.General Sickles is given an interesting treatment; he is the New York politician who became a Union general, although better known as the congressman who got away with murder. Sickles shot a friend, another prominent Washingtonian named Key, a descendant of the famous lawyer-songwriter, who was having an affair with Sickles' wife.Ultimately Sickles was found innocent by reasons of insanity, reunited with his wife, and got with his military and political careers. Gingrich paints Sickles very sympathetically, with Sickles showing much better judgement than Mead and likely poised for a bigger role with the new Army of the Potomac. Clearly Gingrich likes to see politicians do well in other areas of endeavor and he is sensitive to those with marital strife.This book is for Civil War fanatics and not necessarily for the general public, but it is a fascinating view of how our history and country could have changed so completely if one decision made late at night by an exhausted and sick man had been reversed. In 2006, there could be several nations between Canada and Mexico, speaking various languages, and the Europeans could be living under repressive dictatorships and monarchies."},{"Title":"Gettysburg: A Novel of the Civil War","review":"You will find two sets of reviews for this book; one set are Civil War buffs and the other set is politically motivated. The Civil War buffs had a great time with the book and found it to be well worth the money. The politically motivated cannot get past hating the author and never gave the book a chance. If you want to hate the author, this series is not for you. If you are looking for a history of the Gettysburg Campaign, the book by Sears or Coddington is recommended.I am a Civil war history buff and like many of this type something of a Gettysburg nut. When the book came out, I refused to even look at it and said very nasty things about it on the www. Many of the alternate history Gettysburg books are nothing more than junk written for the \\"Lost Cause\\" crowd. These books have nothing to do with history and less to do with entertainment.One afternoon in Borders, with nothing else to look at, I pick this up ready to hate it. In about two pages, I was hooked! The more you know about the Civil War the more fun the book is. However, if you know nothing about the war, this is still a great read and may start you on a life long interest. The book is so good and the historical descriptions so accurate that some buffs worry that people will not understand this is fiction,\\"Gettysburg\\" is a very logical, very well written alternate history. The things that change the course of the \\"real battle\\" are all possible. The change in R.E. Lee that makes most of the story possible did occur about a year later. Yes, the CSA has a run of good luck but a good history of the battle of Antietam will show you that is possible.This is the first book in the best alternate history series on the market.

Anyone who enjoyed &quot;Killer Angels&quot; will like this book. It is written in the same quick style, building suspense as it moves from location to location. As a military officer who has closely studied the Gettysburg battle and its associated contextual factors, and also walked the ground a few times, I was impressed with the authors' portrayal of the strategic, operational, and tactical aspects of the battle.However, I thought there were too many distractions in the book to overlook. The maps were ill-placed and too few. The placement of the photos, with no captions, added absolutely nothing to the narrative. Finally, I felt that the authors were overly repetitive in their use of too many cute phrases. Horses never came to a stop--they were always &quot;reined in.&quot; There were never 50 men/cannons/casualties--it was always &quot;half a hundred.&quot; Some other interesting phrases sounded great when used the first time, but caused disappointment when the exact same unique phrase was used in the very next paragraph.Overall, despite these drawbacks I recommend this book to anyone with an interest in the battle at Gettysburg, or the entire Civil War for that matter."},{"Title":"Gettysburg: A Novel of the Civil War","review":"I am a big fan of historical fiction but wasn't entirely sure what to expect of a novel that changes a very well known story into a new reality. I believe that the authors have done a very credible job in creating an alternative series of events at the battle of Gettysburg, while remaining true to the spirit of the people who were there.While reading the book, I was thoroughly engaged. I found myself engaged up in the events and was caught up in the flow. The tone of the book is very similar to those novels written by the Shaaras, and anyone who enjoys reading their works will find this book appealing as well.Ultimately, however, the problem is that we are left with alternative ending to the actual history. I didn't think that this would throw me too much, but in fact, I find that it does. Although it is an interesting thought exercise to see what might happen if events play out differently, we are stuck in the end with a series of additional questions, that cannot be answered, even if the authors continue this series for several more novels. It will be unsatisfying to me -- I think! -- either way: whether they eventually devolve the story far away from the actual events of the future, or if they take the story back to where we ended up historically, because the next few novels will have to be pure fiction entirely, and that is not the &quot;hook&quot; that brings most of us to want to read historical fiction in the first place.For people who enjoy historical fiction, I believe this well worth a read, but maybe not quite as fully satisfying as traditional works of that genre."},{"Title":"Gettysburg: A Novel of the Civil War","review":"Counterfactual history is always great fun to read, and the idea of re-writing the history of the pivotal battle in American (and in some sense, World) history is obviosly attractive to Civil War buffs - praise to Mr. Gingrich on that account. However, the execution af that great idea leaves a little to be desired.The best counterfactual histories usually make the smallest possible alterations to the actual historical circumstances and events, yet this book is counterfactual regarding allmost every aspect of the Gettysburg campaign. To credibly describe an alternative outcome of the battle, the book obviously needs to \\"improve\\" on the generalship of Robert E. Lee as exercised on the first day of the battle - but Mr. Gingrich does not leave it at that, he also makes substantial changes to the factual quality of the leadership on the Union side of the battle. Portraying poor old general Meade as incompetent really isn't necessary, Lee might have won the battle on his own, had he brought some of his earlier brilliance to Pennsylvania that summer. However, the worst and least credible change to the factual circumstances is the portraying of that complete lunatic general Daniel Sickles as not only competent, but indeed a visionary. Perhaps Mr. Gingrich just cannot bring himself to join the many critics of this \\"political general\\"....Still, the book is well-written and provides good entertainment. I will look for the sequel."},{"Title":"Gettysburg: A Novel of the Civil War","review":"I did not buy this book, a friend who is crazed about anything related to the Civil War subtlety recommend it by putting it in my hand saying really, \\"you will like it\\". Unconvinced that I would be interested in a Civil War battle of anything by Newt Gingrich for that matter, I took it home. This book takes hold of you unmercifully, and in my case reluctantly, and does not let go. The character development is remarkable. You will fret over every agonizing decision and cringe at every gory, and I do mean gory, detail. Three cheers for Gingrich and William Forstchen on their alternative history, I'm convinced - they can tell a great story."},{"Title":"Gettysburg: A Novel of the Civil War","review":"In 1853, Robert E. Lee understood that drastic measures were needed to bring the Civil War to a conclusion favorable to the Confederacy. Although the Army of Northern Virginia was blessed with often brilliant generalship, Lee knew that the Union's ability to endlessly churn out soldiers and war materiel meant that even with mediocre leadership the North would eventually grind down the Confederate forces by sheer force of numbers. Lee could win only by destroying the Union's will to fight, and this would not be done by fighting a strategically defensive war strictly on Southern soil. These considerations led to Lee's fateful decision to invade the North.We all know how that venture ended. Lee, in an uncharacteristic tactical lapse, decided to stand and fight against a well-supplied, entrenched Union force that occupied superior defensive ground south of Gettysburg. Under the circumstances it should not have required brilliant Union leadership to successfully repulse Lee's attacks, but Lee's efforts to take Little Round Top on Day 2 came within a hair's breadth of succeeding. Had Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain failed in his now-famous last-ditch defense of the Union left, the outcome of the Battle of Gettysburg might have been very different.'Gettysburg' takes the &quot;what if&quot; scenario a step farther. What if Lee, instead of making the bullheaded decision to stand and fight at Gettysburg, had withdrawn after the chaos of Day 1 to mount a flank attack designed to draw the Army of the Potomoc to him on ground that gave the rebels all the advantages? Such a strategy seems more consistent with Lee's reputation for audacity and creativity, and co-authors Newt Gingrich and William Fortschen play out the premise in fascinating detail.The authors obviously know their Civil War. The Union and Confederate officers are brought to life and act in accordance with their historical reputations, although Lee, with his sustained air of careworn courtliness comes off as something of a one-note caricature. The picture painted of life in both armies, the weaponry, tactics, the protocol, traditions and habits, are true to life and full of interesting bits of trivia.The political leaders are less well-rendered and seem one-dimensional. One gets little understanding of the interpersonal dynamics of Lincoln's Cabinet. While the politics of the war were not the focus of the book, it would have been enlightening to spend a little more time on this part of the picture.It's interesting to see the new roles that Gingrich and Fortschen built into their story for well-known officers at Gettysburg. Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, the hero of Little Round Top, is found unsuccessfully defending the Union right against as flanking maneuver by Confederate forces, a role he played successfully in the real battle. Gen. Dan Sickles, who impetuously advanced his division at the real battle thus imperiling the entire Union line, revives his reputation here by unsuccesfully pressing Gen. Meade to allow him to advance forward to investigate some mysterious Confederate troop movements. In the book, had Meade only allowed him to go, Sickles would have discovered the Confederate flanking maneuver soon enough to thwart it.I got the book as a gift and initially thought it was an historical novel that followed the actual battle faithfully. While at first I was disapppointed to find that it branched off from true history, I nevertheless quickly became engrossed with the this sharply-written novel and it was interesting enough to finish in just three sessions."},{"Title":"Gettysburg: A Novel of the Civil War","review":"I am a lifelong Marylander and raised in the midst of tons of Civil War history. Gettysburg, especially, has always fascinated me. In addition, I am a huge fan of author William Forstchen. Even with both of those points, I was unprepared for just how fantastic this book truly is.The book begins with detail worthy of a true history book, but done in such a well-written way that you are soon with both armies as they prepare for their epic conflict.You can see the fields filled with soldiers in both blue and gray, hear the roar of the cannons and almost smell the smoke. The people and places are described so well that they almost jump off the page.The battle begins just as it really did. For those of us who love history (and alternate history), it draws us in beautifully. But then events begin to change. There comes a moment when history, as we know it, is altered.Now it is up to the soldiers themselves -- officers and enlisted men as drawn believably by the authors -- to act as they would have done. What will Lee, the master tactician do now? How will Meade react, so new to command?I can't tell you and I'd love to, but I won't spoil one page of this book. Just know this: Buy the book. You won't regret it. (As an aside, I almost never bother with these online reviews. I like the book so much, I just had to.)"},{"Title":"Gettysburg: A Novel of the Civil War","review":"There are many reasons for reading this book. Although an historical novel, it reads like a mystery thriller. I found myself reading as fast as I could to find out the ending. Another reason is, although a novel, the historical accuracies are many. I became much more familiar with the localized geography of the Gettysburg towns, rivers, bridges, hills, and valleys. There are also the breathtaking accounts of charges and maneuvers and skirmishes, not to mention details of military life during battle. I felt, at times, that I was right there and could smell the sickening odor of decaying and singed human and horse flesh, could actually see myself in hand-to-hand combat or running forward with hundreds of other Union soldiers (I'm a Yankee) in a line stretching 1/4 mile over crests and down gullies, through streams and parched, dusty fields, jumping over fallen comrades, and feeling the absolute knowledge that as I ran toward the Rebel fortifications, there was no place to hide and the only thing preventing a shard of lead slamming into me and ripping me apart was mere chance.These are reasons enough. But they are not the main reason. George Santayana once said, \\"Those who do not learn from history, are bound to repeat it.\\" And this is why this book is invaluable -- for reading this type of \\"history\\" makes one contemplate the \\"what ifs.\\" What if the South had defeated the Union Army at Gettysburg? Would Lee have marched on Washington forcing the Union to sue for peace? Would the South have entered into the economic and political sphere of Great Britain? (Confederate delegates were in London trying to accomplish this during the 1860's.) What if the South had won the war? Would the southern states have been able to maintain their internal status quo after part of the slave population had tasted freedom by way of the Emancipation Proclamation? Would they have directed their attention toward Mexico and become a dominant force in the central part of the Western Hemisphere?History not only helps us to understand where we have come from, but also where we are and where we are going. Alas, this book stimulates us to ask: What if Chamberlain had stood up to Hitler at Munich? What if Truman had stopped MacArthur from approaching the Yalu and Chinese border? What if we approach Syria and Iran diplomatically with 200,000 U.S. troops in Iraq as emphasis?Therein lies the beauty of this book."},{"Title":"Gettysburg: A Novel of the Civil War","review":"I have to admit, I was surprised and pleased when I read Gettysburg by Newt Gingrich and William Forstchen. Their previous effort at alternate history, 1945, did not do very well, primarily in my opinion because that book was slapped together in haste to try to sell books based on Speaker Gingrich's name and fame.Not so this offering. The premise is simple. On the second day of the battle, Lee does not assault the Little Round Top. Instead, taking Longstreet's advice, he sends a goodly portion of his army round to the far right flank of the Union Army, seizing its supplies and cutting it off from Washington. What follows is a hellish bloodbath which is all the more searing to the Civil War buff as one sees what happens to familiar charecters such as Chamberlain, Hood, Armestead, and others. I cannot recommend this book enough. It is nothing less than a counterfactural Killer Angels.It is also, irritatingly, the first of a trilogy. Now we'll have to wait for the narrative of the second volume, to be named apparently Grant Comes East.--Mark R.

However, this novel is just too good to pass up for any Civil War buff. There is real tension in this book. While we know from the beginning the South will somehow prevail in this alternative history, the authors do a masterful job of leading the reader on to the climactic battle scene- this time with the Union forced into a reverse Pickett's charge against an entrenched Confederate army. The battlefield scenes are some of the best I have read. It is almost too bad that the authors could not have avoided the 'what if?' premise and just wrote a historical novel based on the true events of Gettysburg- it is that good. However, &quot;The Killer Angels&quot; has apparently preempted the field for future historical novels concerning the Gettysburg battle. What the authors give us in this novel is great character development, with actions taken by the various participants- Lee, Longstreet, Meade, Sickles, etc- which are remarkably true to their character. Historical novels do not get much better than this."},{"Title":"Gettysburg: A Novel of the Civil War","review":"When I first purchased the book, I was very interested in reading such a scenerio that demonstrated an outcome if Lee had fought Gettysburg differently.

I also found it interesting that all the heros of Gettysburg from the North are either killed or wounded, yet the Southern generals go untouched in such a heated battle.I recommend it to anyone looking for an entertaining read, but not as a serious &quot;what if&quot;."},{"Title":"Gettysburg: A Novel of the Civil War","review":"I have to admit that going into this book, I was generally not a reader of novels. I was also not aware of the \\"what if\\" nature of the book. My historical perspective of Gettysburg is that it was a Union victory, a turning point in the war, and both sides suffered devastating losses. But this book did a whole lot more than simply portray how an historic battle could have had a different result. It put a human face on war. The tragedy, the sacrifice, and the perception of moral imperative (by both sides of the conflict) are exposed in this book. History classes never evoked this much emotion. Although novelized, the reality of war is graphically portrayed. The story can be intense at times and is always gripping. For those who decry the \\"what if\\" premise, it is still interesting to note how several strategic decisions, if made differently, could have affected the outcome of this historic battle. I am not a civil war scholar, but I found the story compelling. That is the main strength of the book. Rich portrayals of three dimensional characters in life or death situations that were all too real. But if, because I am not a student of the civil war (and still thoroughly enjoyed this book) I have a \\"fluffy, uncritical mind\\", so be it. Perhaps if you are a rigid ideologue, this book is not for you. It's a novel, not a history book, and should be approached as such. Additionally, the story doesn't end here (and didn't in the actual Civil War either). Grant Comes East continues this outstanding chronicle. Don't miss it."},{"Title":"Gettysburg: A Novel of the Civil War","review":"I have to admit I'm not an avid reader of the historical or military genres, but a friend who is a Civil War buff sent me this book and told me to read it! I was absolutely enthralled. Gingrich and Forstchen are a powerful force and their battlefield depictions are realistically and brutally, but so compellingly, delivered. The narrative grabs the attention and never lets go. The character development is outstanding. This look at alternative history is an excellent write and one I would highly recommend to anyone - history buff or not."},{"Title":"Gettysburg: A Novel of the Civil War","review":"For the most part I have read history (non-fiction), which has included numerous books concerning Battle of Gettysburg. Reading this book (alternative history) was a switch for me, but a very pleasant surprise. The book is well written, fast-paced and is well researched. The plott (or divergence from history) is plausible and there are many events in the book that are the mirror image of actual events (one example- Meade standing in front of numerous union soldiers, who are reteating from the battlefield, saying it was all his fault -versus- actual event with Lee after Pickett's charge).I highly recommend the book for those who want to be entertained with a &quot;what if&quot; history scenario. Those who have a good understanding as to what actual happened during the 3 days in July 1863 at Gettysburg will take more away from this book.Given that this is the first book in a proposed trilogy, the real challenge will be where the authors go next, since they will be further along on an alternative path in history."},{"Title":"Gettysburg: A Novel of the Civil War","review":"They say you can't judge a book by its cover.

Not even the much more accurate Shaara novels were so bold as to position themselves in such a fashion. It is a shame, really, because I found the book to be entertaining.

(He actually died in December of 1863 from and illness.) I was flabbergasted by the audacity of anyone who would try to improve on the actual history of the Battle of Gettysburg. There could never have been a more compelling story written that would trump what actually took place there and to try and pull it off was disheartening. No battle of Little Round Top, are you kidding me? No final charge by Pickett, are you kidding me? I do not fully understand the idea behind alternative history. Don't we have enough of that going on in our public schools now? History is what happened, not what you wished would have happened. Come on Newt and William. I expected much more from talented and brilliant individuals like you."},{"Title":"Gettysburg: A Novel of the Civil War","review":"This book is portrayed as an historical account of the battle of Gettysburg with the infusion of a dynamic dimension to the events and characters made possible by what Newt Gingrich refers to as \\"Active History\\". Gingrich explains what he means by active history in the introduction to this book. As he describes this active history approach to historical discovery, Gingrich explains that by looking at choices which were \\"not\\" made by key figures in this battle as well as uncontrollable circumstances such as weather conditions and other events, made it possible for him to gain a deeper and more dynamic understanding of this great battle. He goes on to explain, though, that it would be mere fantasy to consider an aggressive General McClellan, and that it is important to stay within the boundaries of what would be considered reasonable given the current facts of this historical event. This sounded logical and having read and enjoyed Michael Shaara's \\"Killer Angels\\", I thought I would be reading an historical account of the battle of Gettysburg with new insights to this historical event.What I discovered though, was a complete re-write of the fighting which took place on the second and third days of this battle. I could not find the locations of where some of this fighting took place because I was relying on maps I had, i.e. pulled from Wikipedia, etc., and that this fighting did not even occur in Gettysburg but in surrounding towns and villages. Until I discovered that no account of the fighting which took place on Little Round Top did I realize that this was not a \\"true\\" historical account of the battle, but was a \\"what if\\" scenario of what could have happened. In my own view this is just as much fantasy as presenting an aggressive General McClellan. Gingrich explains that the reason why most people do not enjoy history is because it is presented on facts which are foregone conclusions where the only differences (I assume he means between historical accounts) can only be found in the minutia of things. While this may be true and history, at least to some people, is considered boring, it is what it is. How this could be considered as anything other than fiction is beyond me, and I find it a shame that Gingrich believes that he can re-arrange battlefields and still refer to his work as historical. For those who are not familiar with the historical facts of the battle of Gettysburg, and are not aware of this \\"active history\\" approach, will be confused when they probe deeper into the subject. I do not think that boredom is a reasonable excuse to re-write history, and that Gingrich did a disservice to those of us who enjoy history, regardless of what other's \\"feelings\\" toward it may be."},{"Title":"Gettysburg: A Novel of the Civil War","review":"Unfortunately, for the Southern proponents Lee could not also lose, and that he did at Gettysburg.For over 140 years, the Confederate loss at Gettysburg was someone else's fault.

It may be a very well executed what-if book, but that's all it will ever be- a what if. If you're looking for a \\"realistic' book, this version of \\"Gettysburg\\" is not for you. I just don't get the logic of calling this 'what-if' book 'realistic' when the very essence of this novel is to change history. So in sumary, if you didn't like the U.S Army winning Gettysburg, and wish to dream that the Confederates won, this book is for you.Nonetheless, the book is somewhat entertaining. It has some very exciting elements, and this story does paint a very bloody picture of what the Civil War battlefield was like; our culture these days discount the days of the Civil War as somewhat backward and strange; this novel changes that.Why a one star?

Forstchen in their novel Gettysburg: A Novel of the Civil War, the south did it the first time. And what an imagination those two boys have. R. E. Lee fighting a defensive battle and General Meade fighting on the offensive. This must be another universe I'm in.There's nothing wrong with alternative history. In fact, I loved Gettysburg the novel. Who hasn't contemplated what might have happened if things had gone differently on July 1, 2, and 3, 1863. Longstreet wanted to flank Meade on the morning of July 3 and avoid the fateful attack that has become known, incorrectly, as Pickett's Charge. Longstreet urged Lee to circle around the right of the Round Tops and get between Meade's position and Washington D.C. This would have forced Meade to go on the offensive and batter his regiments on fortified southern positions. Well, as many of you know this didn't happen. Pickett charged and on the afternoon of July 3 and morning of July 4, Lee and his army left the field and crossed back into friendlier territory.While Gettysburg the novel is fanciful, well written, and portrays the major characters correctly, it is still just that; fanciful day dreams. I recommend the book highly. At the end you'll still have that bitter sweet feeling.....and you'll contemplate...What if Lee had flanked Meade.....?Get the book and read it. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Gettysburg: A Novel of the Civil War","review":"I admit, I am a civil war buff. I understood the language, tactics, terms, etc. within this text. Though my relatives fought for the north, I believe I am not biased in my view of the war. For example, I enjoyed Bernard Corwell's series written from a southern viewpoint.This book is so blatantly slanted toward the south it is aggravating. The northern leaders are inept, while the southern are deified. Pickett is a timeless hero while Chamberlain is a drone. Sedgewick as a competent commander? The only northern leader with a clue is Sickles, whose mistakes at Gettysburg cost the north huge losses in reality. Funny, he was a politico - perhaps Gingrich wanted to portray a politician favorably for selfish reasons?I also found the use of the first name disquieting. Longstreet should be referred to by surname, out of respect. Calling him Pete to the reader is too familiar and inappropriate.I found the last 100 pages or so tough to stomach.

I heartily recommend it!"},{"Title":"Gettysburg: A Novel of the Civil War","review":"I really wanted to love this book. But in the end it failed, in my opinion, because of a lack of clarity in the authors' conception of just what changes were being made in this alternative history. In an alternative history one can change the specific decisions that people make, but if it changes their essential nature then it stops being an alternative history and becomes a mere fictionalization. In this case the authors created a George Meade and a Robert E. Lee that simply did not exist on those first days of July in 1863. One would be hardpressed to find a real history of those days that describes the Lee of Gettysburg as a dynamic leader in complete control of strategic plan, his forces, and his health. This was particularly apparent to me as I had just finished Stephen Sears' new book on the battle. Sears describes a Lee who is lethargic, who does nothing to correct improperly placed troops, and who does not ensure that his corps commanders are communicating and coordinating the attack on the third day. He describes a Lee who has little condifence in Ewell yet who allows Ewell to twice talk him out of taking action.Meade is similarly misrepresented. Meade's performance at Gettysburg after mere days in command of the Army of the Potomac shows him at his very best. He knows his commanders well enough to know that he can safely delegate to Reynolds the option of selecting Gettysburg at the battleground even though he had previously drawn up plans to make his stand at Pipe Creek. This is different from Lee's being talked out of his decision by Ewell because Meade had complete confidence in Reynolds, who was a proven quantity while Lee had no such confidence in Ewell, who had recently been elevated to corps command and was seeing his first action after losing his leg. Meade also made an excellent decision in placing Hancock in command of the right wing after Howards corps disintegrated even though seniority would have placed Howard in command. Meade did a masterful job of exploiting his inner lines of communication to shift troops around to reinforce weak spots. Yet none of these qualities of Meade come out in the book.Worst of all the book portrays the tactical genius on the Northern side as Dan Sickles who in reality almost lost the battle by creating an unsupported salient in direct contravention of his orders. This political general is made out to be always correct but never listened to. The real Dan Sickles showed little military talent and owed his position to his political connections, not his military acumen.In the book Meade is an ill-tempered man who is overwhelmed by Army command. He exhibits none of the organizational, strategic, or tactical skills that he exhibited in reality. The Meade of the book is less than a caricature, it is a Meade who never existed.It will be interesting to see how US Grant is portrayed in the sequel to come, and what role is planned for the Cassandra of the East, Dan Sickles."},{"Title":"Gettysburg: A Novel of the Civil War","review":"SPOILER ALERT *****In this novel general Lee is deified, General Meade is vilified along with most other union generals. Gengrich refers to this history as speculative. It is more like dream history of a Georgian. If you can believe that Lee runs a perfect campaign (and I mean perfect) along with the rest of his generals, that Meade is not just incompetent, not just a bubbling fool but almost actively works for the confederacy and that the confederacy holds or captures every position that it must, that the union loses or fails to capture every position it must and that every possible lucky break goes Lee's way then yes I guess you can enjoy this book.If you have read any military history, you will know that nothing goes perfectly. No one gets every break. No general has ever in the history of generals been that good. Not Lee not Napoleon, not Patton, not Hannibal, not Rommel, not Manstein, no one.In the book, Lee flanks Meade and the army of the Potomac. It is really more of an envelopment. Meade stupidly assumes that his only option is to throw his army on the guns of the confederacy. Actually, Meade could have simply moved into Gettysburg, destroying any rebel forces left behind (Stuart and others) and moved North and East, reestablished his supply lines and then swung back toward Taneytown, smashing the forces there. He could then have rolled up the rest of the army of Northern Virginia in detail. No way could Lee have moved against Washington. He would have been trapped between the fortifications of Washington and the army of the Potomac. A first year cadet at the academy could figure that out.Plus, if someone at Westminster had just thought to burn the supply wagons, Lee would have been starved out regardless - Dumb.So, if you don't really know anything, you might like this book. If you have any idea how wars are fought, you should probably pass this up."},{"Title":"Gettysburg: A Novel of the Civil War","review":"The book was well written but I was very disappointed that Mr. Guinrich wrote a completly different story about the battle. I expected a historical novel based on the facts but instead found a new version that made the Confederates victors. Being a student of the civil war and especially Gettysburg I just couldn't accept this. Had I known, I wouldn't have puchased the book."},{"Title":"Gettysburg: A Novel of the Civil War","review":"This is a fine alternative history. Being an avid Civil War buff, historical wargame player, and historian, I find the novel to be entertaining and fairly plausible, that is, up until the destruction of the Army Of The Potomac (AP) after the porposed Battle Of Union Mills (BUM).Indeed, during the whole War Between The States (WBS), no major field army was destroyed in open battle. During the WBS this was so, because of the lethality rifled musket which made defense preeminent in the WBS. The facts are that it was far too easy for a relatively few brave, determined, and heavily outnumbered men to hold defensively. These few brave men would be able to effectively delay or to actually succeed defensively. Examples: Thomas at Chickamauga, Hornet's Nest at Shiloh, Jackson at 2nd Manassas, Lee at Antietam, and I could list dozens more.After the proposed BUM in Newt's book, it is probable that a few knots of determined Union soldiers would have tenaciously hung on just long enough to allow most of the AP's remnants to escape to fight another day.Otherwise, given the chronology of the proposed scenario in Newt's book, such a scenario could have been fairly darn possible.In all cases, the book is exciting, enjoyable, and entertaining, especially, for the WBS history buffs. It is well worth reading, even for those not heavily historically educated or not with such historical proclivities.PS - I have not read the remaining two novels in Newt's trilogy(, but I'm working on them). However, I don't think that a Southern victory at Gettysburg, even one as overwhelming as Newt's book proposes, would have ended the WBS in the South's favor. Indeed, the North had way too much materiel and way too many warm bodies."},{"Title":"Gettysburg: A Novel of the Civil War","review":"This is a what-if version of the battle of Gettysburg during the American Civil War. The year is 1863. General Robert E. Lee and his Army of Northern Virginia invade the North and looks for a decisive battle that could annihilate the Army of the Potomac, thus to be able to claim the victory that would end the brutal war.Gettysburg is only a small part of General Lee's plan. He launches a battle of maneuver. The Army of Northern Virginia march and flank the Union Army. They cut the Union Army line of supply and thread to attack Washington. The Union Army is then forced to fight in the territory chosen by Lee and his generals.A very interesting what-if version of a famous battle. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Gettysburg: A Novel of the Civil War","review":"I was looking for an alternate Civil War history book to read ever since reading Sharaa's excellent series. I was contemplating reading Turtledove's well received book but I picked this one up on a friend's recommendation. Needless to say I was a bit skeptical considering this book was co-authored by Newt but it turned out to be an engaging and entertaining read.This book asks and answers the question of \\"what if\\" Lee had decided not to press the attack at Gettysburg? The first third leads up to this crucial decision and the rest of it deals with the results. It's interesting (and not especially difficult) to try to find the exact point in which this book sways from history to alternate reality.It's unclear which of the authors is responsible for what but it doesn't really matter. The action jumps off the page and the horrors of war envelope the reader. The characters are fleshed out as real people even though the authors end up slanting their actions to produce \\"good\\" guys and \\"bad\\" guys to some degree. Overall the writing is strong for this kind of book and this turned out to be a real page turner.It must be noted that it's probably impossible to write an alternative history without some political undercurrents running through the text. Of course an alternative history of the Civil War will have the South winning something they didn't but it some may argue there is some serious pro-south sentiment in the form of hero worship. Also this book continues the recent historical trend of vindicating Longstreet wherever and however possible.Although this is a fantastic book it really isn't for everyone. A certain amount of Civil War knowledge is necessary to really appreciate this. Advanced knowledge of specific events (most specifically Gettysburg) is important. Knowing things like how big a \\"30 pounder\\" is or the size of a brigade, division, regiment, etc. also helps since there isn't much explanation.Bottom Line: An excellent read for history buffs out there looking for some entertainment. Try Shaara's trilogy for an awesome and accurate fictional account of the Civil War if you aren't too specific with the details."},{"Title":"Gettysburg: A Novel of the Civil War","review":"Very briefly, I was very impressed by the plausibility of this alternate history. I felt that the actions could have played out just that way. The only thing that stands out in my mind as being iffy would be Meade's attack.

Hoever this did little to dampen my enjoyment of this book."},{"Title":"Gettysburg: A Novel of the Civil War","review":"Gettysburg is a great book in that it is well written and formulates good character demension. Historical figures such as Lee and Lincoln come to life and offer believable personal emotional responses to Civil War events.

If it is read with that intent than I am afraid the reader will become more frustruated in that any of their previous knowledge of the war would be countered and questioned.

But we have to face the fact that the \\"alternate civil war-the South wins\\" topic is so overdone that you can fill a library shelf with this genre. Lee wins at Gettysburg? Haven't we all been there, done that, and got the t-shirt? Another book making out the Union to be a pack of villains and heaping hagiography on Bobby Lee? I can see all the negative votes for this review piling up from you guys south of the Mason-Dixon line, but this theme's been chosen already. It has to be said: the alternate civil war genre has been done to death. \\"Guns of the South,\\" \\"Stars and Stripes Forever,\\" \\"A Rebel in Time\\" or \\"Alternate Generals,\\" all jump to mind but there have to have been a dozen other less-memorable titles at least.One more thing needs to be said. Forstchen and Gingrich are good writers. I've read many of their books. But let's not forget that they've both started some alternate history series and then let them die, stranding readers (\\"Down to the Sea\\" or \\"1945\\" ring a bell, anyone?). We can hope that won't happen here and maybe if you go out and buy enough copies of this it won't. Since anything that smacks of the civil war sells like hotcakes, one wonders if that wasn't why the authors chose this topic.All that cynicism and fretting about cliches aside, this is, in the end analysis, a good read, well-crafted and with a good knowledge of the real history of the time. If you just have to read yet another alternate civil war book, it might as well be this one."},{"Title":"Gettysburg: A Novel of the Civil War","review":"Although this book is a good read, it is not plausible. Not by any sense is this story beliveable. For this reason, I can't recommend this book. And, this book has a strong bias towards the south and Lee, making him look like some sort of god.But first, let me highlight why the book is not plausible.First, Newt has us believe that Lee's army can march 35 miles in enemy territory without a warning from the populous that this is happening, all while the Union army could march less than half that disance to get to Union Mills first. And, he writes this off, saying that Meade was getting many statements that the Rebels were here and there and everywhere. I can see this happening in Virginia, but I'm sorry not in Pennsylvania. Incredulous!Second, when Meade is brought news from Buford's courier that Longstreet's corps is in Taneytown and going for Union Mills (where the good defensible ground was at Pipe Creek) and all the Union supplies in Westminster, what does Meade do? He vacillates. And, when Hancock argues with him, he decides to call a council of his corps commanders, waisting six valuable hours of road time. Just think, now really, what would have happened? Hancock would have asked to take his corps to Westminster. Meade, being a new commander, would have relented. After all Hancock had done this before at Fredericksburg (see the movie Gods and Generals which is better than this book), and given the danger of (1) losing his supply center (2) having the Confederate army between him and Washington, DC, and (3) having the Confederate army capture the highly defensible ground at Pipe Creek (where he was planning to defend), and especially how Meade acted afterwards, why wouldn't he have relented? Does Newt think that Meade was that stupid?However, if Meade had acted on this news from his best scouting General, Buford, by the way, who just saved the day prior to this, Hancock would have been in both Westminster, and Union Mills before Longstreet, and that would have ruined Newt's implausible story. Hence - his bias.Third, when Meade finally relents and moves the Army of Potomac to Union Mills, he decides to attack, when more than half the Confederate army is on the hill and dug in, knowing full well that his chances of success are minimal. Also, can't he read the maps like Lee? Doesn't he see that Lee is poised at his flank in Taneytown to take Littletown and close the door trapping the Army of the Potomac in a Cannae battle. But, to the keep the implausibility going, Newt has them attack at Pipe Creek, the ground that the Union generals looked at and noticed that no one would be able to crack. Again, does Newt think that Meade was that stupid?Now for the bias - Newt's love of Lee bias. Buford gets killed (yes he does) from a cannonade of a couple of batteries. All of the generals of the Army of the Potomac but Sickles and Hunt are either killed or captured. But... Lee and Longstreet are in the open, while a cannonade of 230 cannons from the Union army explodes around them, wounding and killing people around them. Do they get killed or hurt? No.And then there is the Longstreet and Lee story - the enduring story about Gettysburg brought out so well in a great book, not a poor book like this one on Gettysburg - but a great book, The Killer Angels.Hey, Newt, Lee did not come up with the idea to do a turning movement and then find defensible ground to get the Union army to attack, be accurate and read some history. Get your facts, right! Longstreet suggested this - see all the credible history books on this. No, Newt, Longstreet did not suggest a turning attack on the flank, but a great move around 35 miles. However, of course, Newt rewrites the facts so that he can make Lee look like a god.But, then again, the flanking wouldn't have worked, because Hancock would have been in Westminster first and the Confederate army would have been destroyed in detail, when Sickles attacked their retreating troops like he suggested.Which, I suppose is why Lee was right in attacking at Gettysburg, and the only redeeming quality of this book. The book's story is so implausible that you recognize the Lee in fact did what he had to do - to attack and dislodge the Union army. He thought this out, recognized that the Union army had the center line of axis due to the roads, didn't have stupid generals, and would be warned by the populace.So, Lee attacked. Why? Because if he did what Longstreet suggested, his army would have been destroyed.When you get all the facts straight, the battle of Gettysburg was set on the first day when Buford forced the Confederates to attack them, held them until Reynolds came up and then the Union held the high ground.Sorry, Newt, although an interesting read, your alternative is implausible."},{"Title":"Gettysburg: A Novel of the Civil War","review":"I'll cut straight to the chase on the \\"chesnut\\" stereotype. (And, are there that many Newt fans who think he's the next Bruce Catton? Or Lost Cause fans who can't accept that you can't stereotype Longstreet?)On page 11, the authors have Lee saying to himself: \\"Then there was Longstreet. ... Sold, methodical, reliable, but everyone knew that he could be too methodical, slow, and firm of opinion.\\"Fact: Lee did, in 1862, call Longstreet \\"slow.\\"The complete fact: In the same breath, he called Jackson \\"slower yet.\\"Longstreet was the only top general in the Army of Northern Virginia who was not a Virginian. So, when the myth of the \\"Lost Cause\\" arose, especially as abated by Douglas Southall Freeman, Longstreet became the ideal scapegoat.As Longstreet later showed at Chickamauga, he definitely was not slow.Now, how does the stereotypical view of Longstreet undercut this book's premise? Well, if Longstreet really were THAT slow, or methodical to the point of sluggardness, would Lee have ever considered such a flanking movement as the authors have him propose?Oops....Otherwise, the particular counterfactual premise is relatively sound, but the authors' acceptance of legend as fact, and the illogical using of it, combined with the stiltedness I noted, get this book marked down a couple of stars."},{"Title":"Gettysburg: A Novel of the Civil War","review":"Very Educational and interesting book.

This process, if done well, makes one think out the actual history then what could have been if... The success of this process rests on the fact that the writer takes an event and reshapes it via a turn of events that did not, but could have happened. When a writer makes characters change their personalities, this loses its credibility. Gingrich and Forstchen made such a change in Robert E. Lee's personality. There was never a chance that REL would have listened to Longstreet's idea of flanking. REL never could conceive of losing a battle with the north, at this point. He could, however, conceive losing the war, due to attrition but not this battle. The tactical changes post-Jackson were never the same for the Army of Northern Va., as they were prior to Chancellorsville. With 100 pages to go, I put this book down.

With the understanding that Gingrich is an experienced and well-read professor of history, I put the reader on notice that the storytelling expertise in this novel (and almost certainly the bulk of the explicit, verisimilitudinous historical knowledge needed to make vivid the characters and the circumstances in which they move) is *NOT* the contribution of Dr. Gingrich, but rather that of experienced and accomplished science fiction author William Forstchen.In science fiction fandom (and fandom very much appreciates skilled journeymen writers like Bill Forstchen), we have a name for the \\"mainstream\\" reader who is essentially illiterate in our genre. We call such a person \\"mundane\\" (from which, no doubt, J.K.

This is clearly stated on the flaps of the book jacket but in many instances, particularly in libraries, the jacket will be worn, torn, and tossed while the book remains on the library shelf. The title page inside the book uses the words &quot;A Novel of the Civil War,&quot; but so does Michael Schaara's historically accurate &quot;The Killer Angels&quot; account describe itself as a novel. Yet one is based on a fabrication of what might have happened and the other is based on what did happen. My fear is that the &quot;Gettysburg&quot; version, without any real disclaimer within the book itself, in the hands of persons not very familiar with this extremely important turning-point battle of the civil war, will contribute to the furtherance of revisionist history that seems to be in vogue these days.Do Newt Gingrich and William Forstchen offer any reasons for not including somewhere in the beginning of the book an acknowledgement that theirs is a &quot;what if&quot; fabricated story after day one of the battle?Bill DolanDrexel Hill, PA"},{"Title":"Gettysburg: A Novel of the Civil War","review":"I have read a number of books about the Civil War and Gettysburg. I enjoy history and discussing the what if's that accompany any historical event. Alternate speculation is ok to a point but I found this book over the top. I would suggest to someone they not read this book until they have a basic understanding of what really happened at Gettysburg that July.I found most difficult, the judgements made about the players. Incompetence, egos, imagined actions, etc that resulted in the conclusions that lead to their deaths and the death of the army of the Potomic were too much. Lee lost. Maybe things would have been different if he had listened to Longstreet maybe not, but he lost.I find him listening to Longstreet more difficult to believe than the possibility that someone may have listened to Sickles, when he noticed the dust to the southwest of round top.A great deal of research was obviously done in the process of writing this novel and the writing was ok. If we rewrite the history of one battle, even in the form of a novel, we should then go back to Chansellorville, and others, where a slight change in the actions of some may have avoided Gettysburg entirely.I enjoyed Killer Angels as fiction but there the fiction was intended to enhance the story, not change it.

Everything a confederate could want except, as the book points out, it didn't matter.

As a proclaimed historian I would have thought Newt would have realized that the presidential mansion was not called the whitehouse until 1912 so named by president Teddy Roosevelt.Among another few discrepancys I found the the book extremely gripping, and it did project me into the era and I found myself being drawn into the anticipation of the various battles projected.

When the book got away from the standard history of the battle of Gettysburg on the first evening of the battle and became alternative, I became very uneasy. After all, though I'm Virginia born, I think the Confederate states were in the wrong, and I'm glad they lost. However, apart from a dozen times where Gingrich et al uses the same word twice in the same sentence, this is well-written, and it seems to come from a throrough knowledge of Civil War army life and of the terrain and of strategy. At its worst, the book is as good as the run of Civil War books, such as the Shaaras. That is to say, it's very readable and not badly written. At its best, though, especially in some of the battle scenes, the book approaches \\"literature\\" quality. I'm surprised to have to admit that.

The best speculative History book I have ever read. 5 stars.C"},{"Title":"Gettysburg: A Novel of the Civil War","review":"Various other books about the Battle of Gettysburg (particulary Shaara's magnificent and peerless novel \\"The Killer Angels\\") have highlighted the dispute between Confederate Generals Lee and Longstreet about whether the Confederates should have attacked General Meade's entrenched positions at Gettysburg, or instead relinquished the field, moved off to Meade's flank, thereby forcing Meade to pursue and attack the Confederates to protect Washington. The Confederates could have then themselves selected the ground for the battle. As we all know, Lee chose to engage in a frontal attack at Gettysburg, in what was probably the critical error of the war. The Confederate Army was never the same again, and was reduced to largely reacting to the maneuvers of the Grant/Meade juggernaut in future campaigns, until the inevitable end came.But what if it had been different? What if Longstreet prevailed on Lee to do what henceforth Lee had always done: select the ground for the battle rather than allowing the Union Army to do so? I will not elaborate much because I do not want to include any spoilers in this review. This book explores this notion subtly, starting off with the Confederate and Union confrontation at Gettysburg on Day One of the battle precisely as it began, but slowly, subtly diverging from the historical facts of the battle in a terribly plausible \\"alternate history\\" version of the battle and the war. The characterizations are very believable and plausible; the key figures, Lee, Meade, Longstreet, Chamberlain, Armistead, Ewell, et al. behave in this novel very much as they might have behaved in real life had events unfolded in the manner that the novel portrays. The reader comes away with the impression that this is very much how it could have been. The alternative scenario that the authors present is in fact quite consistent with the string of Confederate victories, particularly Chancellorsville and Fredricksburg, that had up to that time characterized the war. The ending was unexpectedly dramatic and powerful. This is a fine novel.A minor quibble (no spoilers) which I include largely for fun. Despite the fact that the Confederate Army was undisputedly one of the great armies of all time, I have always felt that success was certain to elude Lee when he campaigned in the North -- the problem of supply was certain to become insurmountable as Lee had no railroads and the Southern government had nothing to send him anyway--much of his army was barefoot! This book addresses this issue, but I still maintain that the possibility of a successful Confederate northern offensive is farfetched. But who can say? At the time of the war itself, the string of Confederate victories against the larger and better-equipped Union Army was indeed against the odds.This is a very fine novel, well worth reading and any Civil War buff will want to include it in his or her library. RJB."},{"Title":"Gettysburg: A Novel of the Civil War","review":"This book will leave you having to tell yourself to breath. The graphical nature really brings to life the brutality of the Civil War. Excellent point by Dr. Forstchen of going into detail about the mechanisms of war(i.e. supply trains, new fighting tactics, weapons). Finally a writer has chosen to present the two sides in a more accurate and pratical manner. The consistent flow of battle and his ability to articulate in detail how the minute descisions of battle can have far reaching effects. Dr Forstchen's other series &quot;The Lost Regiment&quot; will become a must read as well for fans of Gettysburg. The &quot;Lost Regiment&quot; series will take you to levels of writing that are just unimaginable."},{"Title":"Gettysburg: A Novel of the Civil War","review":"There are several instances in history where things could have gone very differently, lynchpins if you will that could have dramatically altered the future course of events for the modern world. What if during the 2nd Punic War Hasdrubal, bearing war elephants and siege equipment from Spain, had managed to hook up with his brother Hannibal and lay siege to and conquer Rome? And what if Britain had fallen during the Blitz of 1940? Imagine how different the world would be had the Allies failed the D-Day invasion? And make no mistake, each of the above examples were very close things that with only the slightest push *could* have happened.Certainly before the Battle of Gettysburg there was in no way a definite way to predict who would come out on top. By July 4th it was a foregone conclusion that although the war would continue it would eventually end with the capitulation of the Confederacy. As I read through Michael Shaara's outstanding \\"The Killer Angels\\" several months ago I had come to the conclusion that if Lee had listened to Longstreet and moved around to flank the Army of the Potomac things might have turned out differently indeed. At the time I had not picked this book up yet and didn't realize that that was exactly what the authors had in mind too.This incarnation of the famous battle takes the premise that during the beginning of the battle Lee does in fact listen to Longstreet and move south towards Washington, blocking off Meade's lines of communication and supply. The only other difference that I was able to pick out related to Jeb Stuart's rejoining the army so early, which happened late in the real battle. And with all the pieces set we now have a pretty good idea of what could have happened had Lee used his noodle instead of brute force. As I stated before, I had read \\"The Killer Angels\\" before this and I must strongly recommend that if you read nothing else before you read \\"Gettysburg\\" then read that. It will be of immense value in that you will know the main characters and their original actions in battle, and conversely will get to see how they may have performed in this version.Several generals that survived the original battle were killed here, and conversely a few that didn't make it during the original live here. As the Army of the Potomac makes a \\"Pickett's Charge\\" of thier own on Lee's army entrenched at Pipe Creek you're really drawn in, particularly as the authors describe the hell it must have been for the men on the front line of each column, describing each volley of Confederate fire from the ridge above with such clarity that it felt as though I was there.How do the principle characters of \\"The Killer Angels\\" fare? Based upon the admittedly limited studying I have done on the subject I must say that each of the characters basic character traits were accurately depicted here. Armistead's sense of chivalry, Pickett and Stuart's yearning for glory, Meade's stubborness, and Chamberlain's quiet stoicism really shine through in key moments, written powerfully enough that at several points I wanted to re-read the passages because the emotion of the moment was too much to let pass with just one read through. The battle in which Chamberlain's 20th Maine defiantly takes on Armistead's entire division was written so well (a strange mix of Rourke's Drift meets Custer's last stand) I almost cried for the bravery on display. And at moments like that I would have to pull myself back and remember that it didn't really happen this way.Whereas \\"The Killer Angels\\" focused on a unique few characters this one by and large focuses on others (although not ignoring the likes of Buford, Chamberlain, or the others) such as the villified politician-general Dan Sickles, Chief of Union Artillery General Henry Hunt, and US Army railroad General Haupt. In this alternate history these characters are the key players. I do hope to see more of the Chamberlain brothers in the future books to be released, and perhaps in this version Winfield Hancock and Lo Armistead will finally be able to meet each other alive and under better circumstances. One can only hope.I have read a number of the other posts and take issue with several of them that say that the book has a bias in favor of the Confederacy, and especially with regards to the description of the Generals involved. I have to say that I heartily disagree with them. After having read several accounts of Meade I feel he was accurately portrayed here. I do believe that the book does justice to him, even evoking a great deal of sympathy for him at the end. I had nothing but the most utter respect for most of the Union generals as described in the book, even Dan Sickles although history may showcase his faults more than his contributions. The kinder, gentler Robert E. Lee is nowhere to be seen in this book, instead he's portrayed as a barely held in check pit bull with regards to commanding the Army of Northern Virginia, although in between battles we are treated to a more traditional view of the man and his ethics.Overall I have to give this book 5 stars. We'll never know for sure if the battle would have swung in this direction had only 2 minor changes taken place so early on, but it sure is enjoyable reading it. It is extremely well written and throughout the book you get the feeling that as you read you're going through entirely new territory. I cannot wait to begin on \\"Grant Comes East\\" in what is sure to be the showdown of showdowns. I must again *strongly* recommend reading \\"The Killer Angels\\" before tackling \\"Gettysburg\\"."},{"Title":"Gettysburg: A Novel of the Civil War","review":"Living in Gettysburg, I like to get books about Gettysburg. The problem is this book isn't about Gettysburg. It starts out familiar enough, but then after the first day of what was the Battle of Gettysburg, the change happens. That change is what creates the alternative history of how the battle might have turned out. Gettysburg is well researched and thought out and truly reads as a book that easily could have happened. The final battle is gut wrenching as it was meant to be. The only problem I have with the book is one that I have with any good alternate history. It's written so well that I might confuse real details with fake ones when I try and recall my Civil War history."},{"Title":"Gettysburg: A Novel of the Civil War","review":"I don't say this very often, but in Gettysburg, Newt Gingrich and William Fortschen have created a masterpiece.The Civil War itself, and the Battle of Gettysburg in particular, have been the subject of countless historical books, novels, and films. The war has also been the subject of more than one \\"what-if\\" scenario; imagining how history might have changed if a decision had been made differently, or if a crucial battle had gone to the other side.In the Timeline-191 series, for example, Harry Turtledove, using Antietam has his point of departure, created a grim vision of a North American continent bitterly divided between nations and condemned to fight not just one, but four wars across much the same territory over the span of 80 years.In Gettysburg, Gingrich and Fortschen start with what was arguably the last gasp of real victory of the Army of Northern Virginia, the Battle of Gettysburg.In our world, it was a battle that lasted three days and resulted in a nearly decisive Union victory. In the novel, however, there is only one day of battle, no charges up the Round Tops, and no suicidal Pickett's Charge. Instead, Robert E. Lee, taking charge of his Army in a way he hadn't before, moves the battle onto more favorable ground in Maryland and, aided in no small part by the incompetence of General George Meade, fights a decisive battle near Westminster, Maryland.What makes this book so great is the detail that the authors go into in describing not only the battles fought over three days in July, 1863, but also the characters that witness those battles, from Robert E. Lee, to Longstreet, Henry Hunt, Artillery Commander of the Army of the Potomac, and Herman Haupt, who ran the railroads for the Army of the Potomac.There are historical allusions galore throughout the book. Joshua Chamberlin, a hero at Little Round Top, makes an appearance, as does James Longstreet, and George Pickett even gets to lead a charge just as glorious, and far more effective, than the one that occurred in reality.And here's one piece of advice. If you do read the book, save enough time to read the final five chapters all at once. The climactic battle at Union Mills, Maryland isn't something that can be digested just a chapter at a time, and it's the primary example of just how well this book is written.As the book ends, the Army of the Potomac is decimated and scattering across the Susquehanna River, but the Union is not defeated and Lee turns his sights on Washington for what he hope will be one final blow to end a war that he wished he didn't have to fight.But there's a wind blowing from the West. Just as Lee was winning in Maryland, Vicksburg was falling and a man named Ulysses S. Grant is heading east."},{"Title":"Gettysburg: A Novel of the Civil War","review":"Rather than take full advantage of the fantasy nature involved in some alternate history novels (like Turtledove's time travellers in \\"Guns of the South\\"), Newt Gingrich and William R. Forstchen give the Confederacy two things, small on their own, to provide ultimate victory for them in the Battle of Gettysburg: General Stuart's early return to the army, and a sudden blast of insight from General Lee and Longstreet when they realize the Union army is deeply entrenched in the city.Unlike Shaara's \\"The Killer Angels\\", the writing here is rich, vivid, and very dense and gritty. The battle scenes are so bloodsoaked and gore-ridden as to compare with Pressfield, and the likes of \\"Gates of Fire\\".The way the two write, you feel the pain, exhaustion, and emotions of the soldiers and generals involved. Rather than repeat what's been done by Michael Shaara in The Killer Angels, Gingrich and Forstchen focus primarily on the primary characters such as Lee and Longstreet, Meade and Hancock, as well as lesser generals and soldiers, such as Artillery General Henry Hunt, Seargents Hazer (CSA), Major Williamson (CSA), General Haupt (US) and noncombatants such as Lincoln himself.The battle scenes are done to such an intensely bloody and emotional degree as to rival Pressfield in sheer scope and drama. While not nearly as gritty and gory as Pressfield, it gets as close as possible in a more modern realm of war. The knowledge of artillery specifically is evident throughout the book, and expert detail goes into such specifics as the timed fuses on cannons, the casualties caused by improperly fired cannons, and the science of how a minie ball pierces through flesh, shatters bone, and flattens into a disc, the way the splintering of wood from shattered cannons or muskets wreaks havoc on troops in battle.The military strategy is also highly vivid and utterly compelling, truly experiencing the mastery of the likes of Lee, the frustration when Ewell fails to move properly, or with Meade's panic and pressured decision-making.The alternate history:*POTENTIAL SPOILERS*Despite being alternately historical, common themes and events which occur in the actual battle unfold in different order here.With Stuart's return to the army on the first day, rather than the end of the second, allowing Lee the benefit of cavalry. Rather than spreading southwards, along Cemetary Ridge and to the Round Top, Lee recognizes the importance of Cemetary Hill and commits an immense amount of soldiery to it. This fails, leaving the Confederates locked in to Gettysburg. This is where another pivotal point occurs, as Longstreet points out the Union army's lack of support south of their lines. Any reader of \\"The Killer Angels\\" knows that this is absolutely crucial, and that had Lee listened to Longstreet, they may well have cut off the Union army from their supplies.In this instance, Lee realizes just how pivotal a move this is.With Stuart commanding a division to demonstrate and distract the Union forces to the north (using trees for cover, and acting as though an entire corps were moving into place), Lee begins moving huge pieces of his army south, towards Taneytown, to eventually attack and take Westminster, and cut the Army of the Potomac off from supplies and Washington. Lee is absolutely critical in having Longstreet move quickly, before the Union realizes what is happening and attempts to stop them.With great pains and brutal skirmishing, as well as Buford and his cavalry making another stand at the bridge leading to Taneytown, between Emmitsburg and Taneytown, leading to Buford's death, Lee finally moves his army down, and storms into Westminster, which is in a panic and flees, leaving the Army of Northern Virginia with a large piece of the Union's supplies.From here, the events of the actual Gettysburg unfold in similar fashion for the Union. The Union moves on Confederate forces, aiming to take Taneytown, and besiege the heavily entrenched enemy at Westminster. Similar to his stand on the Little Round Top on July 2nd, Colonel Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain and his 20th Maine regiment are the extreme right flank of the Union army marching into Taneytown, which is destroyed down to nearly a man by Pickett's Division and Armistead's Brigade. Chamberlain is badly wounded, but survives.On July 4th, the Union chooses its own \\"Pickett's Charge\\" at Union Mills, and Pipe Creek. With nearly 20,000 or more Union soldiers marching across open land, while under heavy Confederate fire (keep in mind the CSA has taken the Army of the Potomac's supplies, and now has plenty of cannon ammunition and rifles), attempting to break through the Confederate's entrenchment at Union Mills. The battle is so bloodily and gloriously written, it outshines Pickett's Charge in sheer scale, blood, and dramatic courage and flourish. It ends with the Army of the Potomac badly battered, Meade proclaiming \\"It is all my fault\\", and Pickett's fresh Division finishing off the remnants of the army still at Gettysburg.While 1/3rd of the Army of the Potomac survives, it is a bloody defeat, and an equally bloody victory for the Army of Northern Virginia, with new instances of battlefield events leading to deaths of well-known heroes and characters, and some shocking decisions many would see as fanservice (such as Lee's utter rage at Ewell's failure to attack the Union forces at Cemetary Hill while the bulk of the Army of the Potomac is being slaughtered at Union Mills, that leads to him dismissing Ewell from the army entirely).While Lee achieves his victory, it is not absolute, and it does not end the war, as the series continues with two more editions. Gingrich and Forstchen write so epically, with amazing emphasis on strategy, battle, and humanity, that it stands as an action-packed, thrillingly dramatic epic even on its own.In my opinion, and I can't imagine very many detracting thoughts, this single edition far exceeds \\"The Killer Angels\\" in nearly every field of literature and novel writing. Outstanding effort by Newt Gingrich and William R. Forstchen."},{"Title":"Gettysburg: A Novel of the Civil War","review":"Outstanding novel, enough history to keep the Civil War buffs entertained and the \\"what if\\" makes it a wonderfull adventure into the imagination."},{"Title":"Gettysburg: A Novel of the Civil War","review":"There are many reasons for reading this book. Although an historical novel, it reads like a mystery thriller. I found myself reading as fast as I could to find out the ending. Another reason is, although a novel, the historical accuracies are many. I became much more familiar with the localized geography of the Gettysburg towns, rivers, bridges, hills, and valleys. There are also the breathtaking accounts of charges and maneuvers and skirmishes, not to mention details of military life during battle. I felt, at times, that I was right there and could smell the sickening odor of decaying and singed human and horse flesh, could actually see myself in hand-to-hand combat or running forward with hundreds of other Union soldiers (I'm a Yankee) in a line stretching 1/4 mile over crests and down gullies, through streams and parched, dusty fields, jumping over fallen comrades, and feeling the absolute knowledge that as I ran toward the Rebel fortifications, there was no place to hide and the only thing preventing a shard of lead slamming into me and ripping me apart was mere chance.These are reasons enough. But they are not the main reason. George Santayana once said, \\"Those who do not learn from history, are bound to repeat it.\\" And this is why this book is invaluable -- for reading this type of \\"history\\" makes one contemplate the \\"what ifs.\\" What if the South had defeated the Union Army at Gettysburg? Would Lee have marched on Washington forcing the Union to sue for peace? Would the South have entered into the economic and political sphere of Great Britain? (Confederate delegates were in London trying to accomplish this during the 1860's.) What if the South had won the war? Would the southern states have been able to maintain their internal status quo after part of the slave population had tasted freedom by way of the Emancipation Proclamation? Would they have directed their attention toward Mexico and become a dominant force in the central part of the Western Hemisphere?History not only helps us to understand where we have come from, but also where we are and where we are going. Alas, this book stimulates us to ask: What if Chamberlain had stood up to Hitler at Munich? What if Truman had stopped MacArthur from approaching the Yalu and Chinese border? What if we approach Syria and Iran diplomatically with 200,000 U.S. troops in Iraq as emphasis?Therein lies the beauty of this book."},{"Title":"Gettysburg: A Novel of the Civil War","review":"The book Gettysburg by Newt Gingrich and William R. Forstchen is a good book if you are really into the Civil War. If you have read The Killer Angels by Michel Shaara then you might find this book very much the same. If you've just started to learn about the Civil War then you probably should not start with this book because it is a fictional book and may be confusing. In Gettysburg the confederates win the battle of Gettysburg. Robert E. Lee the general of the Confederate States of America's Army of Northern Virginia listens to James Longstreet's plan to move in between the Union army and Washington to cut them off on July 2,1863. If you have seen the movie Gettysburg that is based on the Killer Angels this book will make more sense to you. The authors have used characters that were real people during the battle but they are people who were not extremely famous in the battle of Gettysburg. One example is Brig. Gen. Henry Hunt who is the Chief of Artillery for the Union army. I would recommend this book who any one who really likes reading about the Civil War."},{"Title":"Gettysburg: A Novel of the Civil War","review":"The author keeps the historical characters within their biographical parameters, but changes the decisions of Confederate General Robert E. Lee. Lee always forced the enemy to react to him so when the author has him choose a different course of action it naturally forces the Union Commanders to react differently then they did in reality. This story has a very plausible scenario.As a U.S. History Teacher I have fun reading these \\"what-if\\" alternate history stories. Some authors who write alternate history stories end up in the realms of pure fantasy, but Newt Gingrich stays so close to reality that when you are done reading it that if you know your history you find you have a greater depth of understanding into how our leaders effect the world around us."},{"Title":"Gettysburg: A Novel of the Civil War","review":"I bought this book on a rainy day, when I found myself without anything to do. By nature, I love a good read, especially a well written historical novel. I am currently a History major, and thought this book looked good. I did not, however, read the back description which does state that this does end up being about what would have happened had General Lee and the Confederacy won the battle. This is fine, and is actually accomplished brilliantly by Gingrich and Forstchen.This is the first novel I have read by Mr. Gingrich and Forstchen, and must say I am very impressed. Possibly the most compelling aspect of the Civil War is the personal stories that are tied into it, and are wonderfully put into this story by the authors. General Lee is seen to be a very courageous, and genuine man who above all else is a leader. The way he is depicted brings the reader directly into his thought process, and how he wants to win this battle decisively to end the war. He grapples with the prospect of encountering massive casualties, on both sides, but realizes by doing so he may be able to end the war.Once I got about half way into this book, I couldn't put it down. It is compelling, and heart breaking at points. From the horrors of war, followed by the aftermath in which both Union and Confederate soldiers are seen helping one another, tending to each others wounded and dying... it's truly gripping.I admire Newt Gingrich very much, and have a great deal of respect for this man. I look forward to reading his next novel soon. For any true lover of Civil War history, pick up this novel. You won't regret it."},{"Title":"Gettysburg: A Novel of the Civil War","review":"This book and the follow-up two books are written in the style of Michael Shaara's Pulitzer Prize winning \\"Killer Angels\\" upon which the movie Gettysburg is written. They are just as good as Shaara's work.The books are thoroughly researched and the fictional actions of real people is done in a completely believable way. The battle descriptions are enthralling and the depth of the plots are intriguing.I have not been able to be very interested in reading in years, but after starting to read this book, I read every spare minute until I had completed the triology. Completely enjoyable, thought provoking and emotionally stimulating.I cannot rate these books any higher. Reading them on my new Kindle was also a big treat."},{"Title":"Gettysburg: A Novel of the Civil War","review":"1. The prose brings the Civil War battlefield to life.2. The premise is not all that off the mark. Newt and Forstchen create an entirely plausible sequence of events. I felt that even those that some scholars would argue with are adequately explained in the narrative.3. The use of historical parallelism is fascinating, especially Chamberlain's leadership of the 20th Maine now in a different 2nd Day action but again the last unit on the flank, and \\"Pickett's charge in reverse\\", now [fittingly] on July 4th, rather than July 3.4. The characters fulfill their commonly understood (if not in modern scholarship) personality strengths and flaws, and makes a downright fun read.If you pass up this book because you might not like Newt's politics, you are making a HUGE mistake.

I received this book on a Saturday evening and have read it almost straight through. It is a book you just can't set down. I have studied the battle extensively and visited Gettysburg many times.

It is just as good as &quot;The Killer Angels&quot;.I can not wait to read &quot;Grant Comes East&quot;."},{"Title":"Gettysburg: A Novel of the Civil War","review":"The new book \\"Gettysburg\\" by Newt Gingrich and William R. Forstchen is a revelation! Written with reverence and piercing characterizations of the soldiers and generals of both sides it puts forth an alternate outcome for this most famous of battles. It is well researched and written so that anyone: the patriot, the curious, Civil War buffs, historical fiction buffs and CW re-enactors can follow the action with mounting excitement. You will feel you are right there like a fly on the wall. The courage, gallantry, stupidity, stubborness, awe, brilliance, stoicism and professionalism of the artillery, infantry and cavalry are all there in spades. You will cheer and cry and your heart will swell with pride no matter which side you identify with. It shows Americans at their best and worst. I could hardly put it down and anxiously await the sequels. I highly recommend it for anyone who is a reenactor of the Civil War."},{"Title":"Gettysburg: A Novel of the Civil War","review":"I bought this book some time ago and I only recently found it again on my bookshelf. I am a fan of counterfactual (what if) history for their entertainment value and believed it to be an interesting and relaxing book. It was interesting, but the historical content and the historical arguments that can be made throughout the text are anything but relaxing.While I do not agree with Newt on his political views, I had hoped that being a son of Georgia he would try to utilize the more recent scholarship defending James Longstreet, Lee's commander of I Corps. After the war, Longstreet was attacked by old Confederates and brother generals such as Jubal Early because he supported the Republican Party during reconstruction and maintained his good friendship with U. S. Grant. The historiography of Longstreet is extensive but the view for the past 70 years has been that of a slow, mean, slightly ignorant general that didnt like to fight. Furthermore, the cult of Thomas \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson has been very successful in convincing historians and enthusiasts that Lee and Jackson were closer, friendlier, and more understanding of one another. The truth is that Longstreet was the ranking commander of the two, was visited much more by Lee before Jackson's death, made as many errors as Jackson, and was actually favored by Lee because of his party atmosphere around his headquarters (Lee, a Virginia gentleman, was more attracted to the social scene than to Jackson's somewhat odd religious views. In addition, Longstreet was more tactically and strategically minded than Jackson or Lee and was questioned by Lee many times. (Although not always agreeing with Longstreet which is the entire basis of the book.)Knowing this, I was angry at Newt. Longstreet here is constantly being reminded by himself, Lee, and the authors that Jackson was the number one corps commander and Lee's choice when deciding who should be utilized first in the field. Longstreet is depicted very much that same way that Sharra does in his \\"The Killer Angels\\", having him be mindful of his own problems and quick to temper. I still felt that Newt could have pushed harder for Longstreet to be recognized more by Lee rather than have Lee pit Longstreet against the memory of the dead Jackson.The novel centers on three main characters although it does shift its focus to other lesser characters for brief periods of time. Lee, Longstreet, and Federal Chief of Artillery General Henry Hunt are given the most page time. The main issues are Hunt's problems with the upper leels of the Federal Army such as Meade, the very likable Sickles, and his own duties as a artilleryman. Lee attends to the battle, his frustration with being seen as a \\"marble man\\", and the incompetence of his corps and divisional commanders. Longstreet also attends to the battle, his frustration with being compared to Jackson, and his own problems with commanders. Along the way we encounter Sickles, Meade, Hancock (who is always portrayed as a great commander and man) Chamberlain, and Lincoln.It is an interesting counterfactual that takes the greatest issue from the battle, the problem of turning south to flank the Federal army after the first day of Gettysburg, and following it to the authors' conclusion. It is enjoyable for the detail and character development if not the historical issues. Overall, I still feel that Lee is being portrayed in the Lost Cause school of history where he fights for god, country, and honor and can do no wrong. Even after taking Longstreet's suggestion to move to the right, Lee is given credit. While both sides are portrayed as being both merciful and murderous equally, the Lost Cause issue remains with Lee and is a nagging detail that some students of history might find bothersome.While not giving away the ending, it is interesting to see Lee change his personality three times. On the first day of battle he is the typical Lee we have always read about: determined to fight and attack, forgiving of commanders and overly cautious, after the turn south he resembles Prussian General Helmuth von Moltke, quick to find alternate solutions and hear out suggestions, quick to press the attack if a defensible position is established, and more open to moving alongside troops in battle, where as in the final chapters he is General William T. Sherman, unforgiving of incompetence, quick to lead an action if the sight of him will boost morale, and even uttering Sherman's oft repeated statement likening war to hell.Read the book, enjoy the book, but afterwards, study the battle and characters to see if you agree with the authors."},{"Title":"Gettysburg: A Novel of the Civil War","review":"Gettysburg: A Novel of the Civil War accomplishes in expert fashion that which it set out to do. It masterfully transforms the passive history of mere names, dates, places, and seemingly foregone conclusions into a vibrant and exciting brand of living history. Having met Newt Gingrich at a book signing in Atlanta for Gettysburg and listened to a brief dissertation on the subject matter, his vision of active history IS indeed plausible and nothing short of engrossing.Having enjoyed The Killer Angels and Gods and Generals, it was refreshing to be introduced to intriguing military commanders of the Army of the Potomac OTHER than Joshua Chamberlain such as Brigadier General Henry Hunt, Commander of U.S. Artillery, General Hermann Haupt, Commander of U.S. Military Railroads, & who could forget the brazenly impetuous, if not foolishly cavalier \\"hero\\" of Gettysburg - General Dan Sickles, Commmander of the III Corps. The authors bring this eclectic bunch of leaders of The Army of the Potomac, along with arguably their best leader in Winfield Scott Hancock and the hopelessly incapable George Meade, to life in a most skillful writing style.As for the CSA, Gingrich hits the nail on the head when he writes from Robert E. Lee's perspective: \\"I have four men who are supposed to be my direct instrument of command. One is still trying to find his way after losing a leg, the second is sick, the third is bullheaded and not fully committed to this operation, and the fourth, well the fourth has simply disappeared.\\" It is with this perplexing scenario that we are thrust into Lee's quandary of being, for the first time, not oly in the enemy's land, but also without any truly dynamic leaders under his command. This, invariably, is where the stale world of passive history ends and the vibrantly unpredictable world of active history begins. Enjoy.\\"Convince your men that they can win.

Harry Turtledove, the master of the genre in my humble opinion, may have some competition here. I highly recommend it to any alternate history buff. The book does indeed read like &quot;Killer Angels;&quot; repetition of some points is only mildly annoying and Lee does seem to be portrayed a bit &quot;larger than life&quot;, but hey, these are two historians writing this, so I'll accept their interpretation.

Starting with a fairly minor change in Lee's thinking early on, the battle slowly diverges from historical reality, then takes a sudden left turn into something completely different. What makes it so compelling is that this battle could very well have turned out the way it was written here - every decision made on both sides fits the historical characters like a glove. The battles are vivid and make you feel like you were there, especially the final one where everything teeters in the balance. (Bill Forstchen has a definite talent for this kind of writing, as can be seen in Rally Cry and the rest of his Lost Regiment series...)But now I'm really curious -- it seems clear to me that at least one sequel is on it's way, and it's going to be interesting to see how the war progresses from here..."},{"Title":"Gettysburg: A Novel of the Civil War","review":"This book is a fascinating exploration of the possible ramifications of one change in the decisions of Robert E.

A newcomer to writing about the dark side of life, he is quickly emerging as one of the best. My favorite story is called &quot;The Return&quot;, bringing an interesting twist to the end of our mortal lives and touching on how intertwined our immortal souls are to it. His longest story, &quot;Dying Days&quot; focuses on the aftermath of an mysterious &quot;wave&quot; that the earth passes through. The book is full of short stories for everyone that enjoys the tales of death and chaos that could strike our lives at any minute."},{"Title":"Dying Days","review":"Eric S. Brown, 29 years old, is an author with an active imagination. In his collection: Dying Days, you'll find 19 tales of horror and cross-genres. All the stories are quite short, a few were perhaps too short to really get into the characters and the settings. Most of the stories were \`telling' more than showing, which robbed me of any feelings towards the huge cast of characters.In the Introduction, Jason Brannon tells us the end is coming and introduces us the mage called Eric S. Brown and this collection. Jason's introduction was awesome, and pumped me up to read the collection as quickly as I could.Eric seems to like to cross genres. \\"To Reach the Gates of Alavon\\", one of my favorites in this collection, contains cross-dimensional travel, aliens, mythic warriors and a group on a quest that was fun to read. It is one of the longer stories in this collection at 10 pages. Another great story is \\"The Return\\", a great story but it needs work to make us feel for Jack. There was no emotion to follow his realization. A good thing was the vision of reckoning day. This story had little show, and apart from Jack the rest of the cast were 2D at best.Quite a few of the stories contain futuristic elements making the collection part SF / part horror.Some of the \`talk' needs to be improved, but he's a new guy (to this reviewer at least), so mistakes aside (yes there are a couple, not big but noticeable), this first collection is a great start for the young writer. Most readers will find 5 or 6 stories they love in this book and these stories make the $11.95 asking price well worth it."},{"Title":"Dying Days","review":"DYING DAYS is an impressive collection of short stories by a young writer from North Carolina named Eric S. Brown. A lifelong fan of horror novels and zombie movies, Brown first began publishing his short fiction in various online and print magazines in 2001. Since that time, Brown has managed to amass a sizable body of work. In the fall of 2003, Silver Lake Publishing released this collection (available in both print and electronic formats), which represents the best of Brown's work to date.A connective sinew of narrative and stylistic similarities runs through the stories of DYING DAYS, making the collection read more like a short meditative novel rather than a group of independent stories.In DYING DAYS, Brown reveals an almost morbid fascination with the ends of things. As a storyteller, he works with the post-mortem precision of a coroner, cutting through bone and laying bare gristle to reveal the grotesque mysteries hidden in inner cavities. Each story is like a mini-autopsy: you pretty much know from the get-go that all hope has long since been abandoned, but you're still morbidly curious to piece together the reasons why. Brown's stories allow the reader the perverse thrill of experiencing the life-affirming process of discovery within the contradictory medium of death.Although the nineteen stories making up DYING DAYS are certainly all cut from the same cloth, Brown makes each story unique enough to keep the collection interesting. Probably most satisfying is the variety of emphases in stories with a common theme. With end-of-the-world stories such as the titular &quot;Dying Days&quot; and &quot;The Return,&quot; Brown dissects the corpse of the large, and with stories such as &quot;Preservation of the Species,&quot; which focuses on the death of identity and perception, he also trains his scalpel on the corpse of the small.Eric S. Brown is a talented young writer, with hopefully much great work ahead of him. In the stories that make up DYING DAYS, Brown reveals a focused ability to tease out a single theme, and also shows himself surprisingly capable, for a new writer, of handling the heavy machineries of plot and suspense with something like old-hat panache. DYING DAYS is by no means a perfect work. Some of the stories could have benefitted from more detail to character, but this is something Brown can perfect in his future stories and novels. He obviously has the drive and desire to keep creating better fiction, and DYING DAYS stands as a testiment to how far he's already come in such a short time."},{"Title":"Dying Days","review":"Eric S. Brown proves to be one of the strongest young voices in horror in his first solo collection - Dying Days. The title novella takes on a familiar theme, with a surprising twist. The writing lags a bit here and there, and it could've been improved with more action and less telling. Maybe spice up the dialogue, too. After the satisfying novella come several tasty tales of terror, each one unique in its own frightening and clever way. It seems that this book could have been improved quite a bit by an extra proofread and some futher editing. But, a satisfying read and a good book."},{"Title":"Dying Days","review":"I usually don't waste a lot of time writing these Amazon reviews but I really feel I must warn other would-be customers.

This is the story of Squadron ONE ELEVEN.First established on 1 August 1943 as VB-111, the squadron would do battle with enemy submarines from bases in England and North Africa. Redesignated on 1 October 1944 as VPB-111, the squadron would search out and destroy the enemy on the islands of the western Pacific, on the Philippine Sea, the South China Sea and in their harbors and bastions on the coast of Asia.Upwards of two thousand men would serve in the squadron during these years - aviators, navigators, aircrewmen, staff and service personnel. Many of these men had proved their mettle with other squadrons, but most had been civilians just a short time before. They were young, many barely beyond their teens, and they came from a variety of backgrounds from every section of the country.There were never more than three hundred of them serving in the squadron at any given time or place, so those who struggled to fly their airplanes to the squadron's first operational station at St. Eval near Newquay on the Cornish coast of England, were strangers to those who celebrated the war's end on the island of Palawan in the Philippines.Nevertheless, all who served share a comradeship which is born of the common experience of taking a PB4Y, Liberator or Privateer, against the enemy - a comradeship which is nutured by the pride of having served in the squadron whose achievements were so often cited as \\"in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Navla Service.\\" - from book's introduction"},{"Title":"2001 World Book Encyclopedia Set - Complete Set of Encyclopedias - 22 Books","review":"I bought a set of the World Book Encyclopaedia about 10 years ago, paying a huge sum of Rs.35,000 at that time. Later I found out that the local salesperson had cheated me, by telling me that a CD version was not available. Actually, the CD version is much cheaper, almost 1/20th the price, and easier to use. However, you don't get the same sense of satisfaction from the CD version.These books are beautifully crafted (I have an edition bound in leather, and edged in gold) and are a joy to behold and refer to. They take up a lot of shelf space though, and it's a bit cumbersome to locate information, especially now that we are all so used to clicking across an ocean of cross-references. Nevertheless, there is a special charm to rummaging through these books, and I have spent many leisurely afternoons flipping through them. I have also picked up many useful items of information at times, for use in my work. The illustrations, and drawings are simply superb. The entries are written with a nice flow, neither too technical, nor too verbose. However, you must keep in mind that this product is primarily designed for school students, and may not be useful for any serious work.The only worries that I have are about the reliability of information. For instance, I found that a river in Arunachal Pradesh (India) has been named wrongly, and the people of the region do not recognise the name at all. Similarly, in the entry related to Lord Shri Ram, worshipped by millions of Hindus, there is no mention that he is viewed as divinity by Hindus. This obviously raises doubts whether information related to other cultures or topics is also erroneous.This kind of errors could be on account of the selection of biased writers (I saw Mr. K.N. Pannikar on the advisory board), or it could be on account of simple errors that anyone could make. Unfortunately, the problem is compounded by the non-responsive attitude of World Book editors. For instance, I wrote to them a couple of time on e-mail, pointing out these discrepancies, but there was no response.Overall, a beautifully crafted product, one that you will love to own. I only wish that the information in between the binding was as reliable as the binding itself!"},{"Title":"The American Commonwealth","review":"James Bryce's \\"The American Commonwealth\\" is a basic text of American government and politics, one of three such texts, the others being Hamilton, Madison, and JayThe Federalist Papers (Signet Classics), and de TocquevilleDemocracy In America (Complete). These three works, two by foreigners, form the groundwork of a basic understanding of the American system of government. Such an understanding is basic to good citizenship. The lack of such an understanding is sadly demonstrated every day by America's journalists, professors, politicians, and average citizens.Reading Bryce's \\"Commonwealth\\" seems a formidable task at the beginning, since it is two volumes with a total of over 1600 pages. Yet once you begin, Lord Bryce's style is so natural, almost conversational, and the material so interesting to anyone with the slightest interest in American history and politics (and shouldn't that include every American citizen?), that it is actually a very easy book to read.Bryce was Scottish, born in Belfast, Ireland. He became an attorney and a professor of law at Oxford, then a member of Parliament. He was Ambassador to the United States from 1907 to 1913, became a viscount in 1914. He was very well-traveled and well-known in the US, about as well-qualified as anyone could be to write a description of the American form of government. Because of his reputation as a friend of America he had an important influence on the US entry into World War One on the Allied side.The first volume covers the national and state governments, the second volume covers the party system, public opinion, and various aspects of American political and social life. The first edition was published in 1888, and it was last revised in 1914. Over the years Bryce made many revisions as his observations and knowledge of America broadened and deepened.Bryce explains exactly how American government works. A listing of some of the more significant chapters will give an idea of the subjects covered:Chapter 3: The Origins of the ConstitutionChapter 8: Why Great Men are not Chosen PresidentChapter 33: The Interpretation of the ConstitutionChapter 34: The Development of the Constitution by UsageChapter 53: Political Parties and Their HistoryChapter 78: How Public Opinion Rules in AmericaChapter 84: The Tyranny of the MajorityChapter 85: The Fatalism of the MultitudeOf special interest are three appendices. The first is a review by Bryce of the predictions of Hamilton and de Tocqueville. The second is a review of \\"The American Commonwealth\\" written in 1889 by Woodrow Wilson when Wilson was a professor of political science at Weslyan University in Connecticut. The third is a review by Lord Acton.Bryce believed that had the Constitution been put to a popular vote in 1787 it would never have passed. As it was, the only reason the Constitution gained popular support was because of the fear of foreign powers. As Bryce puts it, in the years following the Revolution and the collapse of the Articles of Confederation, Americans felt very vulnerable to foreign intervention:\\"The fear of foreign interference, the sense of weakness, both at sea and on land, against the military monarchies of Europe, was constantly before the mind of American statesmen, and made them anxious to secure at all hazards a national government capable of raising an army and navy, and of speaking with authority on behalf of the new republic.\\"His comments on the relationship between the Constitution, the Supreme Court, and the American people are very timely.Of the Presidency he says, \\"The president has developed a capacity for becoming, in moments of national peril, something like a Roman dictator.\\"His description of the development of the political parties is equally timely, and is the best I have ever read.Some final quotations from Bryce:\\"Someone has said that the American government and Constitution are based on the theology of Calvin and the philosophy of Hobbes. This at least is true, that there is a hearty Puritanism in the view of human nature which pervades the instrument of 1787. It is the work of men who believed in original sin, and were resolved to leave open for transgressors no door which they could possibly shut. Compare this spirit with the enthusiastic optimism of the Frenchmen of 1789. It is not merely a difference of race temperaments; it is a difference of fundamental ideas.\\"He ends on this pessimistic note, echoing Benjamin Franklin:\\"To expect any form of words, however weightily conceived, with whatever sanctions enacted, permanently to restrain the passions and interests of men is to expect the impossible. Beyond a certain point, you cannot protect the people against themselves any more than you can, to use a familiar American expression, lift yourself from the ground by your own bootstraps.\\"Highly recommended in this authoritative and economical edition."},{"Title":"Murder in the Castro: A Lou Spencer Mystery","review":"Finally a well-written, fun and suspenseful mystery set in the Castro district of San Francisco. The author does an excellent job of telling the stories and lives of her gay and lesbian characters. I felt like I knew each character on an intimate level. By injecting the uniquely British wit of the protaganist, this book deals with the controversial issues of anti-gay crime, domestic violence, police brutality and political corruption while still being highly entertaining and humorous.

Great book and the seller got me the product quickly."},{"Title":"Design Your Self: Rethinking the Way You Live, Love, Work, and Play","review":"You might not agree with all of Rashid's ideas about what to do and how to live. However I found most of what he said to be inspiring and spot-on. Particularly the organizing hints and the suggestion to be yourself. Only I'm proud to flaunt my bookcase. I checked this book out of the library and will also buy it because the pros outweigh the cons. He gives you something to think about. The book is worth reading even if only for your amusement."},{"Title":"Design Your Self: Rethinking the Way You Live, Love, Work, and Play","review":"Like many other designers turned decorators turned authors ala: J.Adler, Simon Doonan, etc, Karim will inspire you and challenge you to rethink how you lay claim to \\"objects\\" and how to downsize your dwelling.

I also hate black the way he does so it really hit home for me."},{"Title":"Design Your Self: Rethinking the Way You Live, Love, Work, and Play","review":"An inspirational personal design book written by one of the masters of modern product design. Though parts of the book can be preachy and out of touch with middle-class society, take what he recommends and apply it within the context of your own life. No, I'm not going to replace my wardrobe with 30 matching white, silver, and pink microfiber shirts, but I will be more design conscious about decisions when it comes it each facet of life (Live, Love, Work, Play). If you're tired of traditional self-help books, this comes recommended."},{"Title":"Design Your Self: Rethinking the Way You Live, Love, Work, and Play","review":"This book struck me first in their design and then the content. I must say some of the things in there are pretty common sense, things you already know but it just sort of reminds you that you need to do this or that to get your life even more ironed out.I especially like the what to do at which age part. As with any similar kind of book, you need to be doing the things in it to benefit."},{"Title":"Design Your Self: Rethinking the Way You Live, Love, Work, and Play","review":"I preordered this book and so untill it arrived in the mail i had little idea of what it would be like. I am enjoying reading it, although i was hoping to see photographs of Karim Rashid's work inside but their are none. If you are into design or even if you are not and looking for a book to help you put a little extra something into all areas of your life this would be a great buy for you. I was however somewhat disappointed to find no photos of Rashid's work"},{"Title":"Design Your Self: Rethinking the Way You Live, Love, Work, and Play","review":"I have to say I really enjoyed this book. --Though you have to take his advice with a grain of salt. In the book, he describes the ideal way to live... It doesn't mean that all of us are equipped to live this way. For instance, he says to donate your clothes and buy a whole new wardrobe every year. As wonderful as that would be, I can't afford to do that.He describes his idea of a perfect world, and wants us to strive for the same world. It doesn't mean we are there right now. But the simple changes that he suggests we make can get us one step closer to a better society.I loved the book and would like to read his others soon."},{"Title":"Design Your Self: Rethinking the Way You Live, Love, Work, and Play","review":"I found this book to be pretty inspirational and I do appreciate people who inspire or try to inspire or who care enough and Karim Rashid seems to do this. Maybe in a simplistic and naively optimistic way, but then again, nobody every accomplished anything by pessimistically knowing better. He's certainly accomplished a lot, more than most of us so maybe there's something to be learned here. Layouts remind me of Wired mag, good to page through form time to time, doesn't really require it to be read cover to cover."},{"Title":"Design Your Self: Rethinking the Way You Live, Love, Work, and Play","review":"I bought this book because it was popularly reviewed in some hipsterish magazine. The book is immediately appealing, with engrossing typography and stunning colors.The content is very much a philosophical diatribe on the part of the author. Some of his philosophy I liked and immediately embraced, but much of it my intuition told me wasn't quite right on a personal level. Things like: abolish all black from your wardrobe, furnish your house with no sharp edges, use gawdy bright colors to fill your living spaces with, and make sure every piece of furniture has at least one purpose.But I keep thinking about this book. It won't leave my mind alone. I've started realizing that my mood and life experience *is* actually more enjoyable when I surround myself with white and gawdily bright colors.This comes as somewhat of a shock. I'm a somewhat conservative software engineer who likes to keep all his ducks in a row.But the look of surprise/concern/envy/comedy on my coworkers faces when I showed up to work in flourescent green sneakers was worth the price of this book alone.If you can change something about your life to make it more enjoyable, then go with it. If you can remove something from your life to make it more enjoyable, do that."},{"Title":"Design Your Self: Rethinking the Way You Live, Love, Work, and Play","review":"I just finished this book and like its overall theme and concept. However, Rashid ignores a huge part of many adults' lives: having and raising children. They are briefly mentioned in a relationships section, and later at the end with a life timeline, but the reality of the day-to-day work of raising children is completely missing.Rashid also seems to presume that people have enough discretionary income to upgrade their electronics regularly (he suggests readers purchase new computers, new music-listening devices, new appliances, etc., as soon as they become more efficient). He also disdains books, suggesting that people not display them openly because it reduces clutter to simply read things online. If this is the case, why would anyone actually buy one of Rashid's books?"},{"Title":"Design Your Self: Rethinking the Way You Live, Love, Work, and Play","review":"Why does everyone seem to like this book? Are we all so much in a daze, going with the flow, keeping up with the neighbors, that we have never stopped to think that we might be doing something for reasons other than that we really want or need to do them? If you are at all a spiritual person, or a designer with a more developed aesthetic, this might not be the book you're looking for. I came to it expecting insight about the relationship between work and play in a creative person's life, but had to stop reading after 50 pages (which is rare, my habit is to finish a book no matter what) because he was preaching at me. Why the insistence on bright colors, for the design of the book and a recommended way of life? It is arbitrary. It happens to be what inspires him, he happens to love his life, but that doesn't mean I would benefit in any way by removing all of the edges from my house and wearing bright colors. I have never come across a design related book that made me so angry. Design is not spirituality. Creative work can be a very spiritual thing but I felt he was instructing others in what he considers good taste. How ridiculous! Advice for what to do at each age! a layout like a children's book! Maybe he should rethink his indulgent highlighter book design; traditional book layouts are far more efficient and legible.For those that need examples of bringing creativity into one's everyday life, a better start would be a biography of an artist whose work is related in some way to a personal vision or ideal. Many artists, scientists, and thinkers have led extraordinary lives we can learn from, and would easily expose rashid's life as merely stylized.For those that need to think more about life choices and habits, perhaps a spiritual guide would be in order, not an arrogant, preachy designer."},{"Title":"Design Your Self: Rethinking the Way You Live, Love, Work, and Play","review":"Overall, I'm glad I bought and read this book and agree with the points made by many of the other reviewers but coming to a slightly different conclusion rating-wise.Pros:- The layout of the book and the materials used to make it are unique and interesting. Personally, I thought they were very cool.- It's a very easy read; approachable and uncomplicated while still having plenty of content.- He has some really interesting and potentially useful takes on what one decides to intentionally include in one's life. It's essentially an exercise in awareness and mindfulness and a reminder of the gift that as autonomous adults we can choose (within existing limits) what we want our lives to include. He covers a range of specific categories from the tangible (home and posessions) to the more esoteric (relationships and what they mean to us).Cons:- He presents his personal taste as universal. Besides being contradictory to the main point of designing your own life in a way that makes sense to you, it is also naive of the author to assume that everyone would be happy in the space and conditions that make him happy. Personally, I loved flourescent colors in my teens but would never decorate my home with them now. Also, my husband has no interest in wearing bright pink or silver shirts with white pants and lots of rings (which he claims every man should). And his rule of not having any books in the house because they look horrible... unthinkable in our case and we happen to like the way our library shelves look, complete with his book on them. :-)- This is my own soapbox, but his recommendations to ditch the old and get new seems like irresponsible stewardship. I'm all for maintaining an efficient and up-to-date home, but I believe that needs to be balanced with considering the overall impact that one's choices (including posessions that are potentially hazardous or toxic when disposed of) make overall.- And, echoing what several other reviewers have said, not everyone has that kind of income and needs to make posessions last as long as possible for practical reasons.I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in a fresh, energetic, and interesting take on assessing what's important to include in their life and can tell the difference between Rashid's generally helpful insights and his exhortations on his personal taste and is not bothered by needing to do so."},{"Title":"Design Your Self: Rethinking the Way You Live, Love, Work, and Play","review":"In reading this book I was reminded of an assignment I had in school one time to write a paper on my philosophy of life. This book is kind of like that paper, but written by Karim Rashid and greatly expanded to 300+ pages.He presents his view of thinking about how you live life. In some ways I agree, such as to not get to tied down with possessions, unless you really want them for personal, artistic, or other reasons. In some ways I don't, for instance he recommends buying a new computer every year or so because the new ones are so much better. I'm writing this on one that is several years old but which will take data in just as fast as I can type it. A faster machine would not make me type any faster.On the whole, I like more of his ideas than the ones I reject. But what I really liked was the fact that he wrote them down in such an entertaining way that makes a book enjoyable and gives you food for thought."},{"Title":"Design Your Self: Rethinking the Way You Live, Love, Work, and Play","review":"To a designer, everything is up for grabs. This is premise that drives Rashid's book. A wonderful concept segregated in categories of relevance that make it a fun and simple read at first blush. Upon futher investigation, one begins to decipher Rashid's intent to taking on design as a lifestyle as well as a concept that is applied to tangible goods. Brilliant at times, waxing poetic other time, and slightly sterotypical in his opinions (but then again, he is entitled to them), I have to say that I adore this book. It is a wonderful reference book for daily living and it is a great source for reminding oneself to be present and how to create an environment that fosters being present. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in re-vamping, organizing and enjoying their life vis a vis their lifestyle design."},{"Title":"Design Your Self: Rethinking the Way You Live, Love, Work, and Play","review":"I was hoping to find more inspiration in this book. It seems a bit random and self-absorbed. I just get the impression that because he's very successful as a designer that he thinks he's tapped into some sort of universal truths about style, which just isn't true. It started out alright, with some positive, energetic outlooks on life and making it your own, but then he also tells you to copy his style. Shouldn't we be finding what makes us feel most positive? Perhaps bright candy colors aren't for everyone? or wearing all white? Also he seems totally unconcerned with what happens to all this stuff after you're done with it.. he encourages you to upgrade things all the time, but what happens to it then? We can't all afford to and even if we could, how much waste do we really need to create? it's irresponsible."},{"Title":"Design Your Self: Rethinking the Way You Live, Love, Work, and Play","review":"Rashid talks about designing your own life by your own rules. Somewhat ironically, he provides you with many of his own \\"rules\\" for doing so. But don't let that steer you from this book. He provides an amazing approach to building and growing in today's modern world. You don't have to agree with all suggestions and ideas, but it will help you understand what it means to live a life that is substantially more fulfilling than the typical paint-by-numbers, status quo lifestyle that is all too common."},{"Title":"Design Your Self: Rethinking the Way You Live, Love, Work, and Play","review":"I typed in Karim's name looking for some of his decor on Amazon, and to my surprise there was the listing for this book. I went to my local bookstore, and read 70 pages of it. I had it in my hand, took it to the counter, and then changed my mind, because it was $25! The design and layout of the book is great, and full of what the author constantly notes as \\"BRIGHT COLORS\\".The next day I immediately started to declutter, some of my things, and even my husbands! This is surely a reference book for design and self help.I have been looking for a book like this for a long time! I am a freelance graphic and interior designer, and I appreciate Rashid's words.

However, we had to exchange the first one he got because the knight's right arm was separated at the elbow when he received it. It looked like some child had taken it out in the store, assuming it was like an action figure with movable arms, tried to bend it, snapping it off. The new kit we got has a knight whose left arm keeps falling off at the shoulder, but since it can be put together again the kids don't mind so much.Today, however, we tried playing the backgammon game that came with the set. First, the board did not match the diagram in the directions, making it hard to figure out. It appears from the directions that the board was designed wrong: the white and black points are reversed, and the numbers go backwards on one side. The directions also say to put pieces that are bumped on a strip in the middle of the board, but the board is so small you can't really do this. The game required two dice which were not included (we used pieces from another game), and when you got to the end, it told you that you'd have to roll a \\"1\\" to win, something that is hard to do with two dice.I emailed the publisher to see if they have any fixes for these problems and am waiting to hear back. The other kits in these series sound interesting, but for $19.95 it'd be nice if they were put together better."},{"Title":"Lift The Lid On Knights","review":"Most of the time, girls don't like knights, but when I bought this as a present for my cousin, I wanted one for myself. it was neat to learn about knights and everything they did and what stuff meant that they did.

The scars have healed well, and no obvious signs of human activity remain. Nevertheless, I have this information on the authority of the national park and state park historians and archeologists. I suggest that \\"disappointed reader\\" check out any of the several local history books available in the Prairie Creek visitor center bookstore for more information on this fascinating subject.Below are my comments on the other \\"errors\\":-Fortuna is listed as the nearest town to Bull Creek Flats because it has restaurants, camping/hiking supplies, and other services readers are likely to be searching for when they head to a town. Smaller towns with no services are closer, but of little use to hikers.-While horses are not officially allowed on the Bull Creek Flats trail, the south side of the creek occasionally sees some unauthorized equestrian use. Hence the addition of \\"equestrians\\" under the \\"Other trail users\\" heading.-A phone call placed a few minutes ago to Humboldt Redwoods State Park confirmed that the Giant Braid is still standing. The Flatiron Tree fell after the book was written (2000).-In any book of this size, a few errors are inevitable, and the 900ft. elevation gain for Bull Creek Flats is one of them. That will be corrected in the next edition, but if readers turn to the page with the hike profile, they will see a more detailed representation of the hike's elevation.-I do not encourage anyone to cross the creek by wading or log crossing, and warn them to be careful if they do attempt it, as it can be dangerous.-The numerous redwood stumps in the Skunk Cabbage Creek drainage testify that redwoods did indeed once grow there, and the stumps' flat tops suggest strongly that they were logged.-If you read the passage carefully, you will learn that skunk cabbage gets its scent from the single specialized leaf (spathe) that forms a yellow hood over the flower spike, not from the green foliage, although the latter do produce the scent when crushed.-There are numerous conflicting claims to \\"world's tallest tree\\", and not enough space in the book to document them all. I stuck with the claim of the National Park Service.I can assure potential readers that this book contains over 350 pages of useful information about hikes in Northern California. It took nearly two years to research and write; it has the best maps of any hiking book I've seen (kudos to the cartography folks at Globe-Pequot); and the format allows for easy navigation on the trail without wading through text to find simple directions. I did my research for this book, especially for Humboldt County. Unlike \\"disappointed reader\\", I live here.Happy hiking!Dan Brett"},{"Title":"Hike America Northern California (Hike America Series)","review":"I get cranky when a book disappoints me so I hope I'm not being too critical about this one.While not a native of Humboldt County, I'm very familiar with many of the trails in the county. When this Hike America book was recently given to me, I eagerly looked up one of my favorite trails in Prairie Creek: Fern Canyon &amp; James Irvine Trail. I was floored when I read the author's claim that hydraulic mining created Fern Canyon. There is no historic or geologic evidence that hydraulic mining ever took place at Fern Canyon. The steep canyon is obviously the result of erosion by Home Creek, the stream that flows through the gorge.Ok, the author blew it on Fern Canyon but what about another one of my favorite redwood trails: Bull Creek Flats. I first read the \\"Quick Specs\\" section. I question his claim that the trail rises 900 feet; it's on bottomland and surely doesn't rise more than 200 feet, if that. He lists Fortuna as the closest town but what about Scotia, Redcrest or Weott, all of which are much closer to the trailhead. He also states that the trail is open to horses...wrong! So much for the Quick Specs. In the trail description the author suggests wading across Bull Creek or crossing on downed logs during the off-season when the summer bridges are removed. Bad idea! Bull Creek has washed out several permanent bridges due to high water flows and you really need to know what you're doing before you attempt to wade this creek during the off-season. Forget about crossing the creek on downed logs; it's a good way to end up with a broken leg. I'd check with the park folks before attempting to cross Bull Creek when the summer bridges are out. The author doesn't mention that two of his highlight features, the Flat Iron Tree and Giant Braid, fell a number of years ago. In the \\"Trail Description\\" section the author recommends returning along the south side of Bull Creek yet in the \\"Miles Directions\\" and map he has the reader hike the Rockefeller Loop and return on the north side of the creek (for a total of three Bull Creek crossings). Apparently he became as confused as I did when I tried coordinating the Trail Description and the Miles Directions. Rather than having to flip back and forth between the two sections, why can't the info be integrated like in most trail guides?I'm familiar with only seven or eight of the 50 trails in this book, but I found more errors in the few trails I've hiked. The logging that took place in Skunk Cabbage Creek was spruce, not redwood. The odor from the skunk cabbage plant comes predominately from the flower spike (spadix), not the leaves. You won't notice a skunky smell on this trail unless you hike it when the flowers are in bloom. Gold Bluff Beach was not created by hydraulic mining but rather by the ocean. (The bluffs were there long before any miners arrived.) It's been at least 10 years since the \\"Tallest Tree\\" in the Tall Trees Grove was considered the world's tallest plant. Last I read, there's a tree in Humboldt Redwoods that is now thought to be the tallest tree, but they keep find taller ones. Also, the guide really should have included a warning about how steep, rough and dusty the road to the Tall Trees Grove is. BTW: If you're renting a vehicle, you better make sure the rental agreement permits travel on this type of road.In all fairness to the author, perhaps he just didn't do enough research on the Humboldt County hikes and the rest of the book is accurate. However, I've lost confidence in the author and plan on trading in this book for more reliable guides to Northern California's hiking trails.P.S. Why on earth was a full-page article about the Kinetic Sculpture race included in the Headwaters hike section?"},{"Title":"Hike America Northern California (Hike America Series)","review":"Alot of what is in this book is inaccurate and false.

In an age of big in your face pop up books and childrens books that make your eyes hurt these books are a wonderful find. As always the illustrations are beautiful - I read all the reviews first but few had actual specifics about the actual invdividual stories, so that's what I've done here. I hope it helps others know what wonderful books they are. I wish they were easier to find in Canada. Anyhow this book is about pelle a swedish boy who had a lamb of his own. As they both grow Pelle's clothes get too small. So he shears off all the sheeps wool and takes it to his one grandmother and asks her to card the wool for him. In exchange she needs her carrot patch weeded which he does for her. Then he takes it to his other grandmother and asks her to please spin the wool into yarn which she does in exchange for him tending her cows. Then he asks the painter for some dye to dye the yarn. He asks him to take the row boat over to the store for some supplies and offers him the change to buy his dye there. Then he dyes the wool himself and hangs it to dry. He asks his mother to weave the yarn into cloth for him which she does as he watches his little sister for her while she does it. He then takes it to the tailor and asks him if he will make a suit for him...since the tailor needs his hay and wood brought in and his pigs fed.

Great reading-no villains-just one hero-Pelle"},{"Title":"Pelle's new suit, (Never grow old stories)","review":"Pelle, a young Swedish boy, has a lamb which he cares for himself. When he begins to outgrow his coat, he shears the lamb and seeks help from his family and community to card, spin, weave, dye, and sew the wool into a suit, trading chores for the help that others give him. Finally he puts on his new suit and thanks the lamb for the wool, while all the people who have participated in the project look on.The illustrations in this story are charming, and the story is delightful on many levels. In contrast with the modern stereotype of childhood as a season of entertainment and consumption, Pelle not only demonstrates responsibility in caring for his lamb, but also contributes to the priorities and needs of others as they care for him. The story also gives a picture of how clothing and fabrics were laboriously crafted before the advent of industrial mass-production, and the cooperative nature of the project emphasizes a value for community. All these elements combine to create a book which is comforting, enjoyable and educational."},{"Title":"Pelle's new suit, (Never grow old stories)","review":"Pelle has outgrown his suit - just as his lamb has grown a new coat of wool. Pelle helps his grandmothers, his neighbor, his mother and the tailor. With their assitance and some work of his own Pelle is the proud owner of a new suit. This is a beautiful story of cooperation set in a time and place when such tasks as sheering your sheep and rowing your boat to shore for supplies are commonplace. Elsa Beskow's books never fail to deliver a good story combined with loving illustrations."},{"Title":"Pelle's new suit, (Never grow old stories)","review":"How I only wish life could still be. Pelle cuts his wool from his sheep, and through several barters of chores, has a suit made for him. Innocent. I believe this the best Beskow book. Ages2-6."},{"Title":"Pelle's new suit, (Never grow old stories)","review":"I think this book is great but I was intentionally ordering a full-size hardback, not a mini edition. Nowhere was the book described as mini but that's what was shipped.

It's a great small size, but not what I was looking for. Make sure you are ordering the size you want!"},{"Title":"Pelle's new suit, (Never grow old stories)","review":"A thoroughly lovely tale of a boy who learns both resourcefulness and cooperation so that everyone's needs are met. It takes place in a time most of us only wish we remembered. I'm not saying the past was perfect (I really enjoy things like hot water heaters and integration), but it's delightful to read about a little boy who can do many useful things, in a time when children were more a part of society and less separated by bright red plastic noisemakers."},{"Title":"Pelle's new suit, (Never grow old stories)","review":"I've loved this book since I was about 4 years old, and now am purchasing it to give to my god child.It's a wonderful story, with delightful pictures, and it is a true &quot;keeper&quot;!"},{"Title":"Pelle's new suit, (Never grow old stories)","review":"Although I love this story and its illustrations, I did not realize this edition was so small.

I've added this to my library to read to my grandchildren."},{"Title":"Pelle's new suit, (Never grow old stories)","review":"I was thrilled to see this back in print. This is a lovely story for many reasons. Unlike some of Beskow's other stories, Pelle's New Suit is realistic fiction. In this story, Pelle notices that his clothes are getting smaller as the sheep's wool is getting longer. He comes up with a clever scheme to remedy the situation. First, he shears the sheep and then he barters his services in return for the help of others to create his suit. This is a great story to introduce children to the process of how clothing is made. More importantly, they will see a spirit of cooperation for something that is good. In the end, they may also be inspired to tackle problems with the same ingenuity and hard work as Pelle. I don't have the newly republished version, so I can't comment on the size."},{"Title":"Pelle's new suit, (Never grow old stories)","review":"Perfect Book.

It's a sweet story that recalls a place and time most people today don't know. The values are good, but the translation needs some serious work and the other errata drive me nuts with each reading.

The illustrations are enchanting and my daughter loves to giggle at the goat who stays with the weaver to &quot;supervise&quot; her work. She asks questions about the process of weaving and the interaction between the goat and the weaver. It's a lovely little book I wholeheartedly recommend!"},{"Title":"The Goat in the Rug","review":"This is a gentle book, both the words and illustrations, which guides the reader through the process of making a traditional Navajo rug. Told from the goat's perspective, humor is interwoven with facts. My 5 year old wants to add that the goat ate up some of the flowers the weaver had collected when she wasn't looking.The last page states: \\"This is a true story of a weaver and her goat who lived in the Navajo Nation at Window Rock, Arizona.\\" The end plates have pictures of items used in making the rug, including local plants and which parts of them are used for certain dye colors (ex. juniper branches used for brown dye).My mother lived on a Navajo reservation as a child and so I've purchased this for her childrens book collection so that she can read it to the grandkids when they visit."},{"Title":"The Goat in the Rug","review":"I was raised on this book and it has always been a favorite of mine.

Be sure I will be reading it to my art students when we study weaving and I bring my spinning wheel to class to show them how to make yarn."},{"Title":"The Goat in the Rug","review":"When I was a docent at the Museum of Northern Arizona, we used this book as the basis of a puppet show to teach children about the Dene (Navajo), their weaving, and their relationship with their animals. You'll also learn about goat personality (a Carl Sandburg quote: \\"A goat sidles up beside you and gives you a look as if to say, 'Ain't life grand'?\\") This story is amusing, heartwarming, and educational. I have given it to my children, their children, and their children. (As for the relationship with their animals, the Museum also has photos taken when the federal government decided the Dene/Navajo had too many animals on their reservation, and sent soldiers in to shoot them all. In those particular photos are the grandmothers embracing, crying out, and weeping over their dying animals.) But this book, while speaking to this bond between the Dene/Navajo and their animals, is lighthearted, and your children (and grandchildren, and great-grandchildren) will love it as much as mine do. (Also add these wondrous books to their library: Silverstein'sThe Giving Tree 40th Anniversary Edition Book with CDorThe Giving Treeand Joosse'sMama, Do You Love Me?. I've also bought the doll that goes along with Joosse's book9\\" Mama, Do You Love Me? Plush)."},{"Title":"The Benchley Roundup","review":"I only found out about Benchley from a short book on Algonquin Round table quotes but I'm very thankful for it--it's shameful that Benchley has basically been forgotten. Why on earth should such a gifted, briliant comic writer be so little known nowadays? There's simply no reason I can think of. He's just as good as Perelman or Thurber, and he deserves much wider reading. This anthology is a pretty good collection of his work, featuring most of his more popular and beloved pieces. What one notices about Benchley is that he really isn't quite so gentle and affectionate in his humor as those who remember him say--he was the original master of what he termed the &quot;dementia praecox&quot; (crazy written humor basically)and when he applies this to ordinary life or parodies bad writing he can be quite cutting. His style is just about perfect--simple but carefully constructed to wring every laugh it can out of subtleties of phrasing and syntax. His parodies of academic writing are among the greatest ever, effortlessly exposing the bad ideas, pretension and willful obfuscation that lurk beyond so many professors' works. His humor is that of a good natured man so bewildered with the modern world that he defends himself with humor, and depending upon the situation that humor can be quietly observant or fast and crazy, therefore reducing its target to nonsense as well. This book needs to be re-printed with a beter cover, and it wouldn't hurt to add more stories to make it a definitive overview of the man's work. Having done so, the book should be aggresively marketed so that it ends up in the humor section of every bookshop in the land. It's the least Benchley, one our greatest American comic writers, deserves."},{"Title":"The Benchley Roundup","review":"I love Benchley's work. I began reading &quot;My Ten Years in a Quandary...&quot; as a child at the cottage nearly forty years ago. I can still read that tattered book and enjoy it immensely. I am less thrilled by this compilation--can't always agree with Nathaniel Benchley's choices and miss some of Gluyas Williams sketches that have been dropped. Get one of the original collections--starting with, if you want, &quot;My Ten Years...&quot; and then, when you decide that you want everything the man ever wrote, you won't be buying stories you already have."},{"Title":"The Benchley Roundup","review":"Whether providing program notes for you to read while the Mezzo changes her mantilla (and she always has more mantillas than songs), providing a cut-and-paste for Dreiser's next American Tragedy (complete with maps, recipes, and court transcripts), or simply describing The Wreck of The Sunday Paper, Robert Benchley proved that comedy could be witty, sophisticated, and yet completely unpretentious. His scale was Seinfeldian, but far from being the eminently hittable Suburban Snot, Benchely admits to being as confused about the detritus of daily life as the rest of us. And like the rest of us, he finds it amazing that we make it from one day to the next with our lives, and even some shreds of our dignity, intact. He likes opera music, but knows that the plots are wild, trashy, and more than a bit ridiculous. He knows that travelling with kids is a contact sport that only the hardy survive (the hardy usually being the kids themselves), and that Christmas dinner with the extended family is something very pleasant in the abstract but a trial by fire in practice. And he has a sharp eye out for go-getters, lecturers on health and sex, and the pretentious of any sort, all of whom make life even more annoying than it already is. A few of the period details may strike you as quaint, but at heart, this is still very contemporary comedy. And very funny."},{"Title":"The Benchley Roundup","review":"&quot;A great many people have come up to me and asked me how Imanage to get so much work done while looking so dissipated.My answer is 'Don't you wish you knew?' and a pretty goodanswer it is, too, when you consider that nine times out often I didn't hear the original question.&quot;That's Benchley. Note the easy, flowing, understated prose(read: no disgusting postmodern Latinizing) that marked thisextraordinary humorist's observations on life in America and abroad. Benchley wrote about everything, and everything he wrote showed the same magical mix of cynicism and whimsy."},{"Title":"The Benchley Roundup","review":"This is such a delight: a master of humor takes us on a romp through his life. Think of James Thurber, O. Henry, and the more modern David Sadaris and W. Bruce Cameron. Rich, full, delightful humor, all based on the human condition. This is a collection of essays that is absolutely timeless, as funny now as when they were originally written."},{"Title":"The Benchley Roundup","review":"One of the funniest people who ever lived! all rolled into one book. the book was in good condition as described and shipped promptly. I still read myself into howling laughter over this book, which I first read as a young teen. highly recommended unless you have no sense of humour."},{"Title":"The Benchley Roundup","review":"This is and always has been one of the funniest books I've ever read. I've since read much more Benchley, but I agree that this is some of his best - a great starting place for the Benchley uninitiated. Particular attention should be paid to \\"More Songs For Meller,\\" \\"Editha's Christmas Burglar\\" and \\"How To Speak French,\\" in my opinion. A great gift for anyone who appreciates great humorists."},{"Title":"The Benchley Roundup","review":"Robert Benchley was the best, the most influential and, not incidentally, the funniest humorist of the 20th century. And his influence is still being felt here in the 21st.All modern humorists (including yours truly) owe him a debt of gratitude. We also owe him an apology for outright thievery: Any humorist who says he or she hasn't stolen from Benchley is lying, drunk or both.\\"The Benchley Roundup\\" is, in my opinion, the Master at his best. This book has literally had me howling with laughter. The best thing about Benchley's humor is that it was never cruel or mean-spirited. He wrote about the little things of everyday life, which is why his stuff is still fresh and still funny.Thank you, Mr. Benchley, for all the laughs."},{"Title":"The Benchley Roundup","review":"If you could judge a book by it's cover, you would assume that this book went out of print around about 1964. This is really too bad, because when you try to resell it on Amazon or eBay it will really reduce the price you can ask for it.Robert Benchley, who died in 1945, wielded an extremely dangerous sense of humor that tragically took the lives of many of his contemporaries. Nevertheless, there is no disputing that his work has influenced so many American humorists that it's not even funny.From Woody Allen, Dave Barry, Steve Martin, Regis Philbin and many others to an unknown reviewer like me who is trying desperately to be funny, there is really no comparison."},{"Title":"Midlife Orphan: Facing Life's Changes Now That Your Parents Are Gone","review":"I lost my father when I was a teenager and then I lost my mother a few months ago, and it is very different feeling like an orphan in middle age (I'm 42). This book was good at helping me frame the feelings I've been having related to this recent loss as well as the changing relationship with my siblings. In this sense it was very useful for me and helped me explore my feelings so that I can deal with the loss in a better way. There aren't many (if any) books that deal with this topic, so this book is rare gem. I know in coping with my loss, most of my friends just figure that my mom was old and it was a mercy for her to go, but there truly is a profound loss when you've lost both your parents. It's a unique type of orphan-hood when it happens as an adult - and I am glad this book helped me see this. In other words, I am glad to know that I am not crazy or being immature - and this is a really unique and profound loss.There were some aspects to the book that I found less helpful. Since I don't have children of my own, I skipped the chapter on that. And my mother didn't leave any kind of an estate, so I also skipped the chapters on inheritance since many of those issues don't apply to my situation. Overall, the book is very thorough and explores practically every aspect of losing one's parents and coping with the aftermath. I highly recommend this book for anyone facing this type of loss."},{"Title":"Midlife Orphan: Facing Life's Changes Now That Your Parents Are Gone","review":"This book was excellentwould recommened it to anyone who has theirparents and need some emotional and wordsthat let them know they are right with theirfeelings and they are not alone..ExcellentPatti"},{"Title":"Midlife Orphan: Facing Life's Changes Now That Your Parents Are Gone","review":"The title really spoke to me because I had said it to myself a bunch.

I am an orphan, at the age of 49, I lost both parents this year 9 weeks apart. I never really grieved my mother the first to pass on. For taking care of my father whom had been ill for about ten years and thought he would go first. So this book makes me understand why I am feeling as I do. It has given me much insight. And I know I am not the only one, whom wonders and feels like this. I have siblings and it is hard to talk to them. This book lets me see things we never see or try not to. I purchased the books for all of us. I will read and reread it. And pass it on to friends, when their parents pass. As I was the first, to loose both. And I had called myself an orphan, just before my local paper ran the story, about the book. It is wonderful, and helpful a must read for any adult whom is orphaned.

My healthy mom unexpectedly died ten months ago. I thought it would still be OK because I had my dad, my world would stay the same because he was still with us. But five weeks later he unexpectedly died, I feel of a broken heart. I remember thinking it was now not OK - I was now an orphan. I found this book easy to read and contained many things I thought and felt. There is so little written on this subject, especially if your parents died within a short period of time. I was pleased to read about siblings and what goes on with them as well as the part on inheritance. The book validated my feelings. This sensitve topic could only be approached by someone who has lived it. Thank you Jane Brooks."},{"Title":"Midlife Orphan: Facing Life's Changes Now That Your Parents Are Gone","review":"My mother died a year ago and after the first few months, I felt like I had no one to share my grief.

It was wonderful. It helped me deal with so many issues that I hadn't even thought of. I passed it on to my brother who then passed it to his wife when her mother died. My copy has been making the rounds and I suggest anyone who finds themselves a &quot;Midlife Orphan&quot; to buy it and read it."},{"Title":"Midlife Orphan: Facing Life's Changes Now That Your Parents Are Gone","review":"I first read this wonderful and touching book when my father died two years ago. My mother died last week, so I picked the book off my shelf and I'm reading it again. This book is invaluable for any adult who has lost a parent to death. I gave a new copy as a gift for my best friend when she lost her mother last year, and it was a great comfort to her. The author, Jane Brooks, brings touching anecdotes from many adult orphans together with her own experiences dealing with her parents' deaths.I cannot recommended this book highly enough for any adult who is dealing with the loss of one or both parents. It may make you cry at times, which is a normal part of grieving, but it will also give you the strength and courage to deal with being \\"alone\\" in the world as an orphaned adult."},{"Title":"Midlife Orphan: Facing Life's Changes Now That Your Parents Are Gone","review":"From the stirring opening commentary to the dramatic close, Midlife Orphan is a godsend to any grieving middle-aged son or daughter.

I don't feel so alone, strange or isolated now - no longer confused as to why I am experiencing some of the emotions, feelings and thoughts I have. I am still accepting that life has changed, in ways that no one, until they walk the path of both parents lost, will understand. The book has given me hope,reassurance and brought comfort to the sharper edges of my grief.

It's easy to read, without a lot of jargon, and it provides all the information one would need on the topic. The author has done a great job pulling together all the research. Anyone who works in teaching, education, social work, child development, or counseling should have this on their book shelf. In short, this book is a treasure!"},{"Title":"Resiliency: What We Have Learned","review":"I'm a doctoral student studying resilience education. I have read hundreds of books and articles related to resilience. I wish I had known to read this book first because it carefully presents the evolution over time of the three stages of resilience work. Knowing these stages has helped me sort out what seemed to be contradictions in this field. The new attitude of positive psychology is truly a new mindset and makes resilience education a mainstream topic that is appropriate at any school. Overall, this book has carefully organized material and is well written.For a more practical how-to book, also get \\"Resiliency in action: Practical Ideas for Overcoming Risks and Building Strengths in Youth, Families and Communities, 2nd ed.\\" (Henderson, 2007) which Benard co-authored."},{"Title":"Resiliency: What We Have Learned","review":"FAST EFFICIENT SERVICES FROM SHIPPER.

I love a good romance with a spalsh of intrigue to keep me going. An unliklely couple because of one is conservative (somewhat- or so he thinks) and a woman who loves being who she is. Sometimes, it takes only the \\"right\\" person to bring out be best in someone. So, it is for Cameron and Mia. He's a PI and she's a frustrated secretary with a wonderful artist within. They find out opposites can do wonders for each other. Some of the love scenes burn up the pages but..I loved them.

She was too unpredictable and wild for his tastes but he learned that Mia was so much more than the kind of woman she let him see in her appearance. Cameron learned Mia had other unique talents and he was actually attracted to at least some of her wild side.

I really enjoyed this book. Yes Mia needs to grow up which she does so through out the book. This book to me was realistic and I would read it again. I will be watching for more by this author. : )"},{"Title":"Too Wilde to Tame","review":"Cute book with standard romantic plot and chemistry between the hero and heroine. It is a cute book and I like this author in pretty much everything she has put together. The book isn't THAT original so that is the only thing that kept me from giving it five stars but the sexual tension and chemistry is there and the love scenes are very hot so if that is what you are looking for then this will be a good choice for you."},{"Title":"Too Wilde to Tame","review":"For easy, fun reading, Janelle Denison really makes for a great time! I love her dialogue, the sex sizzles, the characters are fun and attractive to imagine in my head, and it certainly takes me away from the ho-hum life of raising 3 stinky kids and carting them around their soon-to-be summer activities--yikes! For those of you looking for serious literature, I suggest you look for the classics section in the library. For the rest of us who are looking for some fun--Janelle and the WILDEs are the greatest! The characters are believable, the relationships are not just flat on the page but are actually believable, the romance and sex scenes are great and I find them very enjoyable. Keep writing--I can't wait for the next installment!"},{"Title":"Too Wilde to Tame","review":"Eh. Too Wilde to Tame is not horrible, but it's not great, either. Kinda meh.The heroine is your standard acts-&-dresses-like-a-slut-but-is-just-misunderstood. The hero is a P.I. and partners with her cousin. Somebody's stalking her and calling her a slut, tramp, etc, and her roomie is in an abusive relationship.I figured out the stalker immediately, but still didn't buy the motive, and didn't like the consequences.But the main reason for the \\"meh\\" is the writing. It's kind of bland--telling instead of showing. At one point, she tells us that the position they're having sex in is erotic. Good grief. If it's really erotic, you don't have to tell us that.Anyway, like I said--not a bad story, but there are too many better writers to waste my time on more books by this one."},{"Title":"Too Wilde to Tame","review":"Too Wilde to Tame by seasoned author Janelle Denison was a really enjoyable book to read! What I thought was going to be just a 'super sexed-up' bit of fluff, was sexy, fun, but also tackled sensitively, some incredibly serious topics. A blend well done.Intelligent and dedicated PI, Cameron Sinclair, was the devastatingly gorgeous specimen of man, who was not only thoughtful, kind and HOT, but was overly generous in his sexual ministrations, which only added to his allure. For years he had endeavoured to remain impassive to the provocative sexual taunting and teasing from saucy Mia Wilde, but when she increased the pressure - what was the man to do?Despite Mia's previously successful attempts to cocoon herself behind her facade of brazen seductress and reckless party girl, Cam caught glimpses of her vulnerable, guarded heart, and was moved. She was a woman emotionally isolated, determined to be independent and remain free from hurt. A woman intensely passionate, fiercely loyal, scarred, yet wickedly delightful. A woman he could fall for.Mia had wanted Cam for years. She'd known he was meticulous, hardworking and assiduous in his commitment to his work, but the intensity of his passion, when unleashed on her, was breathtaking. She was determined to keep her heart protected, a task becoming more impossible, especially when he delved deeper to uncover the real her, and actively promote her dearest passions. But Mia had a lot of work to do to be able to accept the love of another, and despite Cam's earnest patience, would he wait long enough?Janelle Denison cleverly weaved two separate and intriguing mysteries into this passionate love story. I'm certain they were written with intentional predictability, but were none-the-less rousing, especially with the extra twists and turns thrown in. Both were balanced well, with the book moving at an excellent and engrossing pace. The sexual chemistry was scorching, yet also tender. Sad and poignant moments brought tears to my eyes, and masterful strokes of humor and sass interspersed, eased tension successfully. This author writes well. (I am so going to continue in the series!!!)Despite a few surprising editing errors (incorrect female character in some scenes, tense and spelling discrepancies), the book flowed well.I really enjoyed Too Wilde to Tame. The characters, both lead and supporting, were believable, the dialogue too, and the sizzling chemistry was intense and delicious."},{"Title":"Too Wilde to Tame","review":"This was a great book. Enjoyed it immensely. Can't wait to read the others in the WILDE series. Erotica at its best."},{"Title":"Too Wilde to Tame","review":"I like other works by this author much better. I did not care so much for this one, but it was an okay read. The main male character, Cameron St. Claire, is a private detective. This novel was trying to cover three different cases, instead of just focusing on the case regarding the stalker of the lead female, Mia Wilde. I think the only reason she spent time going into detail for Cameron's investigating a potential cheating woman, was so she could work in Ashley St. Clair (from another book). It just made the book go off in so many directions, that I read through this one slowly. I didn't feel compelled like I couldn't put it down, which is how I decide how well an author can intrigue and capture the reader! This one fell short."},{"Title":"Too Wilde to Tame","review":"Too Wilde To Tame is a great story. Wonderful romance with a happy ending.

I've never read anything by this author before but I'm going to remedy that right away. I loved the fact that the heroine doesn't put herself in danger stupidly by thinking she can handle everything. Great characters and interaction with the right balance of excitement with romance."},{"Title":"Too Wilde to Tame","review":"Known as the Wilde Child, Mia has a reputation for being outrageous, brazen and unpredictable. She's been flirting with Cameron, but even though she can tell he's attracted to her, so far she's been unable get him to take the next step. Private Investigator Cameron Sinclair has been fighting his unwanted attraction to Mia Wilde for years. The Wilde men are protective of the only girl in the family. Plus, Cameron has been friends with his partner Steve Wilde, Mia's cousin, since they were teenagers and he has no desire to ruin a life-long friendship. Cameron firmly believes that Mia is not the type of woman he should get involved with, no matter how much he desires her. But when a stalker begins to send Mia photos of herself in various places, Cameron agrees to help her without letting her family know what's going on. Only the more Cameron is with Mia, the more he realizes that there is so much more to her than the Wilde Child the rest of the world sees. It isn't long before they are involved in a passionate relationship while they continue to look for Mia's stalker. But once the stalker is found, how can Cameron convince Mia to let down her guards and take a chance on forever with him?I have read every Wilde story that Janelle Denison has written and have never been disappointed. Too Wilde Too Tame is no exception. It is hotly sensual and loaded with emotional intensity. There are appearances by all the Wilde characters whose stories have gone before and a tease for Joel's story that is yet to come. This book was so good I devoured it in one night. Readers who have been waiting for Cameron and Mia's book will love it!MelissaReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed"},{"Title":"Too Wilde to Tame","review":"I was very disappointed in this book because of all the great reviews. I found Mia to be blindly self-centered and selfish and never came to like her character. Having insecurities is human, hurting others repeatedly and over long periods of time because of those insecurities shows a lack of courage and/or the intelligence required to be at all perceptive or sensitive to others' feelings, to say nothing of one's own. Towards the end of the book, Cameron tells her he loves her and she doesn't even acknowledge it. At all! Not to his face nor even in her private thoughts afterwards. She hurts her stepmother all her life, therefore, hurting her own father (although the author never acknowledges that part, but how could he not be hurt when his youngest and only daughter doesn't accept the woman he loves during all her growing up years! Maybe he too lacks perception, and never figured out his wife was hurt by Mia's lack of trust.) Mia shows her selfishness with her roommate, Gina, as well. Gina is involved in an abusive relationship, comes home with bruises and Mia won't push the issue because she doesn't want to lose her friendship! And this behavior and all of her insecurities stem from her mother dying when Mia was only 5? Sorry, but I just couldn't swallow it. Not only do most people not even remember much of what happened when they were five, but at that age kids are extremely resilient. It's hard to see this as the sole reason for Mia's many emotional issues since she was surrounded by a very loving family the whole time after that and nothing else bad happened to her, ever. Not even with boyfriends. After all, she was the one who broke up all her amorous relationships. And no, I do not accept her family's over protectiveness as a cause for her inability to form long term relationships. A cause for an overly developed sense of independence, yes, but not fear of getting emotionally involved. Frankly, if so little messed up a person's psyche to such an extent, our world would truly be hell on earth for everyone, all the time, everywhere. I gave this book 2 stars, because I've read worst. But that's not saying much. I'm very sorry I paid full price for this. I can't believe there are so many 4 and 5 stars! They really fooled me into buying this book."},{"Title":"Too Wilde to Tame","review":"I've been drawn to Janelle Denison's work ever since reading her first full-length novel, WILDE THING. Although the protagonists of that novel were one-dimensional, the sex was incredible! My second Denison book was THE WILDE SIDE. Unlike her first novel, the protagonists were more fleshed out. However, I still didn't care very much for them or their story. The sex scenes had the usual Denison flair--very graphic with lots of explicit, contemporary language--which I really enjoyed. Yet, if we were talking about bedroom Olympics, then Scott and Ashley (THE WILDE SIDE) lose to the inventiveness, wild, and craziness of Steve and Liz (WILDE THING)!Denison was correct in that Cameron and Mia's story was the most anticipated out of the Wilde series. I was one of many who anxiously awaited their story. My compliments to Denison for further improving on character development. In this story, I actually cared about the protagonists. However, a major disappointment (to my surprise) was the sex scenes! Not graphic enough and lacked a great deal of provocative dialogue. What happened, Ms. Denison? Since reading her previous two novels, I've come to rely on Denison for VERY steamy, hot, erotic reads. Sure...the sex scenes were titillating enough, but once again, they paled in comparison to WILDE THING. (I noticed that Denison is no longer with Brava and now publishes her books with Berkley Sensation. Wonder if that change has anything to do with it?).Sex scenes aside, however, I rate TOO WILDE TO TAME as the best Wilde book so far. Mia and Cam are both delightful; their story enjoyable, fun, and really sexy! The ending is especially sweet--making me wish I had a man like Cam!! I can't wait for Denison's upcoming novel. BORN TO BE WILDE, featuring Mia's older brother, Joel, is the last member in the Wilde family to get his own story."},{"Title":"Too Wilde to Tame","review":"We've been introduced to Mia and Cameron in previous novels but all the anticipation fell flat in TOO WILDE TO TAME. The plot was thin, uninteresting and just filled pages between sex scenes. The sex scenes didn't do it for me either and I blame that on the fact that there was a severe lack of character development. Cameron was a sexy, shell of a man while Mia appeared to be exactly what she didn't want to be labeled ~ a tramp.All of the Wilde stories are the same. The characters agree to a short affair and the result is always the same. I wish Denison would give us something new. I'm barely interested in Joel's story, which is next. If you haven't read the other books in the Wilde series, I'd recommend WILDE THING and THE WILDE SIDE. Their plots are thin as well, but at least the romance is steamy."},{"Title":"Too Wilde to Tame","review":"Janelle Denison writes the much-anticipated story of Mia and Cameron in Too Wilde To Tame.Mia Wilde has fueled her rep as the wild child in her family.

When a stalker starts sending disturbing photos to Mia, she turns to Cameron to help her find the culprit and the two agree to a brief no strings affair, which quickly heats up. But when the person behind the photos is found, will it mean the end of the affair? Mia's roommate Gina is going through difficulties too as her relationship starts to turn abusive; could he be behind Mia's stalking?While the characters (even the secondary ones) were well developed and there was plenty of chemistry, I had a hard time swallowing the mystery aspect of the story - readers could guess the identity a mile away, so it seemed very anti-climatic when it was revealed. I loved the character of Cameron - he was sensitive and well developed and a perfect foil to Mia's impulsiveness. I also liked that Mia had a talent and dream that she was able to pursue once her confidence was achieved. There were numerous love scenes that got pretty redundant after awhile - sometimes less really is more. But the dialogue was good, the premise of the story interesting, and the pacing just right. I only wish that Denison would've either dropped the mystery aspect altogether (since she couldn't pull it off) or beefed it up to make it more believable. It's kind of a drag, as this novel had potential to be better."},{"Title":"Too Wilde to Tame","review":"In Chicago, for the past two years, private investigator Cameron Sinclair hid his desire for Mia Wilde from the teasing, taunting, and smart mouthed woman who he feels is TOO WILDE TO TAME.

Someone is threatening to expose her as more than just a tease with provocative photos that they could have only gotten by stalking her. Not wanting to send her family into an alert mode that Homeland Security would envy, she asks Cam for help. He agrees.

This book is a tribute to his wife, who is very beautiful. I would assume she is petite and is clearly slender but not skinny. These are exquisite photographs, using light and shadow and are indoors and outdoors. Luba is a very beautiful young woman, and perhaps the facial shots are the best. While there are no page numbers, the close ups of her face on page 21 and 22 are stunning, and just of her eye area (page 49) is wonderful for the detail. The pictures are a loving tribute and range from dress to complete undress, so there is something for everyone. There are a number of pictures with her twin sister. There is a great variety in the size of the different photographs. A closer examination of the photographs shows an attention to shadow, composition and angle that set this book apart from some others. The book is a joy. However, if one wants a book that covers many beautiful and nude women this book has only one woman. Perhaps the book would have been enhanced with a few less photographs at a slightly lower price but why quibble."},{"Title":"Luba","review":"The 2nd Edition of this most marvelous book was officially released in June of 2004. It's actually gotten better with time. Never is an artist more articulate than when he covers terrain that is both deeply intriguing as well as being one that he's intimately familiar with. Petter is at the height of his power here.Luba would possess any man in her orbit, she is that magical (and yes, I've met her in person), but the hold she sways over her husband Petter is utterly enchanting. She continues to play a major role, the star attraction if you will, at his website, Hegre-Archives.com, and Petter's work with her continues to be some of his best material.

Peter Hegre is clearly an accomplished photographer. Like one of the other reviewers, I would have liked to see him show more range in his photographs. But, I am not disappointed in the ones he published. There are two photos that were slightly edgy, making me wonder if there were others. Although Luba is his wife, she is also a professional model and probably has a publicist that won't let him publish the edgier material, if it exists. Still this book has a large volume of very nice photos of a nearly perfect body."},{"Title":"Luba","review":"These are very nice, straightforward photos, many of them nude. There's not a high development of narrative, nor abstraction, and I guess I am looking for more of one or the other. The eroticism is very warm and friendly, as well. Must be because Luba is the photographer's wife, but for an erotic photograph to succeed, I think it needs a touch of danger, as Newton did so well. So you are left with very cuddly photos of a pretty girl who is married to the photograher, who has worked for Playboy et al.

Christopher"},{"Title":"We Speak Your Names","review":"Through WE SPEAK YOUR NAMES: A Celebration by Pearl Cleage, African-American women have been honored in a way that will stand in history, just as their contributions have. This poem was written at the request of Oprah Winfrey to celebrate and commensurate the accomplishments of women honored at Winfrey's 2005 Living Legends event and ball. And the book concludes with a biographical sketch of each woman.These women, consisting of civil rights leaders, actresses, writers, singers, etc., are all role-models to those who followed and are following after them. A few featured are Maya Angelou, Ruby Dee, Nikki Giovanni, Dr. Dorothy Height, Coretta Scott King, Rosa Parks, Toni Morrison, Alice Walker and Nancy Wilson. Cleage's poem encompasses many of the known traits of these women, with themes of strength, sisterhood, honor, and courage, but also acknowledges their beauty and wisdom--showcasing them individually and also collectively. They are remarkable women who should be honored, cherished, thanked and most of all remembered. Kudos to Pearl Cleage and Zaron W. Burnett, Jr., for WE SPEAK YOUR NAMES and to Oprah Winfrey for the vision.Reviewed by Tee C.

Goodreading"},{"Title":"We Speak Your Names","review":"Dr. Maya Angelou said \\"Thank you is what we say to God\\", when she humbly accepted the honor of being praised at Oprah's Legends Ball. The centerpiece of the event was Pearl Cleage's poem, which is lovingly presented in this inspirational little book.I had some problems with who Oprah honored and didn't honor, but I'll save that for when the DVD comes out. Anyway, it was her party and these were the people who inspired her.The beauty of Pearl's poem is that it is all about respecting our elders and remembering that we are AFRICANS! And we must be proud.I also like how Pearl asks the reader to adapt the poem to suit his or her own needs. We can use it as a template and praise the living (as Oprah has done) or the dead, women and men, African in America, or in Africa.What disturbed me about Oprah's bash was that most of the so-called \\"Young'uns\\", while claiming inspiration from the Legends, really don't seem to me that they will achieve much when they are of age. Many of them were flavor-of-the-week Black celebrities. I can only hope the event will truly inspire them to achieve something notable.In the early 90's, we had the group Arrested Development pushing the concept of honoring our elders and remembering our roots. THESE are the true Young'uns and they would be legends too, if they weren't so rudely thrown aside by the hip hop craze.I was also troubled seeing Jesse Jackson having another photo op, while Dr. Bill Cosby was noticeably absent. Mrs. Huxtable was there, but it wasn't enough for me. Cosby is leading the new struggle- for Africans in America to be articulate and educated.Bill Cosby, I SPEAK YOUR NAME!And this is why I love the poem so much. You can follow the African griot tradition and invoke your ancestors and celebrate your tribal elders. When you speak their names, they live forever, and inspire the youth.I also encourage young Africans in America to find legends IN Africa. Nelson Mandela is an obvious choice to start with. This way, we will reconnect with our mother country and be nourished by her sweet milk!Kudos to Pearl Cleage and thanks to Oprah, whose heart is in the right place."},{"Title":"We Speak Your Names","review":"This little book is priceless! Inspired by Oprah Winfrey's vision to celebrate the accomplishments of extraordinary African American women, Pearl Cleage answered the call by penning the poem that was key to Winfrey's 2005 Living Legends event. Cleage drew inspiration from the honoree's accomplishments and with a line-up that included greats like Katheryn Dunham, Cicely Tyson, Toni Morrison, Coretta Scott, King, Diana Ross, etc., it was easy to pick a muse and let her imagination flow.The poem celebrates the spirit of sisterhood, courage, and resilience that these women possess. Pearl's signature themes of freedom, courage, wisdom, and strength (which are often echoed in her novels) are also evident in the prose. She marvels at how the honorees are a beautiful, mulit-talented group of women whose impact will be felt for generations; but more importantly she thanked and recognized each and every one of them (by name) as the truly amazing women they are. A brief biography of each of the twenty-five honorees is also provided in the back of the book.The poem makes for a perfect gift to friends, sisters, mothers and is a \\"must have\\" for any woman's personal library. Bravo - this is a wonderful tribute!Reviewed by PhyllisAPOOO BookClubNubian Circle Book Club"},{"Title":"We Speak Your Names","review":"In the spirit of Oprah Winfrey's Legend's Ball, We Speak Your Name is a brief compilation of African American women and their achievements. Ms. Cleage begins with a beautiful homage to women of strength and character. Reading the poem feels like a personal invitation, and the brief passages that follow are a guided tour through the amazing history of black women in this country and around the world. Ms. Cleage, in her introduction, tells us about her invitation to write, and she takes us along for the star studded ride to its glamorous conclusion. Her poem details the success, the sacrifice, the angst, and the adulation of women at the top of their field, and gives us insight on how they feel having reached that. Although she describes each legend in the short bios the follow, the passages are descriptions of these legends filtered through the lens of Ms. Cleage's profound perception, as a woman, as a griot, and as an accomplished author in her own right in awe of her sisters.A short book of less than 50 pages, this is a must have for all women. It is a perfect size to slip into a purse, as a stocking-stuffer, into a briefcase for that nerve-wracking interview, or a gift basket for a friend. However it is delivered, it is an amazing journey through history on the gentle but strong backs of those who made it.Brava!Reviewed By: Angela T.

Whether or not ritual studies has really moved beyond Victor Turner is a hot topic of debate for those of us who deal with this area of research...but whether or not you need to know him is a given, and it all starts with this text."},{"Title":"The Ritual Process: Structure and Anti-Structure","review":"Victor Turner is one of the main anthropological thinkers, along with the likes of Claude Levy-Strauss and Mircea Eliade. Unlike other such figures though he speaks deeply on a single culture, the Ndembu in Africa. From this vantage point he discusses ritual patterns both those specific to the Ndembu and those of more universal scope. His thoughts are deep and rich.There are two important contributions Turner makes to the field.The first is in the sense of undifferentiated community he sees in the \\"comunitas\\" which naturally lies in tension to social structure. This concept is helpful in understanding ideas of liminality and how it is induced and directed in rites of passage according to the van Gennep model.The second is the notion of antistructure, which is the active challenging of social structures which provides room for creative interplay between society and members of it. This also allows us to interpret ritual as a creative endeavor rather than just a repetition of past patterns.In these ways Turner moves from the more purely structuralist works of Levy-Strauss and Eliade to a slightly more fluid work, building on structuralism but treating cultures as dynamic, homeostatic systems as opposed to rigid, inflexible ones. In this regard it is not always quite clear whether to treat him as a structuralist or a post-structuralist as he seems comfortable moving between both worlds as it suits him.This is an important book. I'd highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Ritual Process: Structure and Anti-Structure","review":"Victor Turner is one of the great names in anthropology and this is a classic work of analysis of social rituals.

You can use its throws to knock your attacker senseless and get cleanly away, all without breaking the fragile bones in your hands and feet with punches and kicks. This type of fighting is a good idea, but it is much easier read than done. This is evidenced by an informative section on groundfighting in the back of the book.As good as this book is, its many excellent photos and descriptions can't teach people how to use its techniques effectively. Timing, speed and body feel are key to successful application against an unwilling opponent or attacker, especially in this type of wrestling. An ex high-school wrestler won't let you do this stuff to him unless you are very fast. Anyone who has a modicum of boxing or kicking skills will break your nose or worse as you attempt to grab them.Having spent years sparring and wrestling in several different fighting arts, it's clear to me that only repititve practice with a qualified instructor can make fast wrestling fast enough to work. Unfortunately, unless you happen to live in LA or Columbus, Ohio, I have not been able to find qualified instructors of this art in the US. I wish there were more.For people in the rest of the US, perhaps some of the techniques could be used to augment practice in other grappling arts such as judo, aikido or ju-jitsu. But you would have to find a very open-minded instructor. Good luck."},{"Title":"Chinese Fast Wrestling for Fighting: The Art of San Shou Kuai Jiao Throws, Takedowns, & Ground-Fighting","review":"By far the most exhaustive guide to the art of Shuai Jiao (Aka Shuai Chiao) in English. Prior to this volume, there was only a single other work in English on this most practical of wrestling styles (&quot;Fundamentals of Shuai Chiao&quot; by Daniel Weng, who was a student of Chang Tung-sheng's). Authors Liang Shou-yu and Tai Ngo offer a thorough history, in-depth explanation of the theory behind this form of fighting, and important body-toughening exercises. Then they demonstrate a rather complete catalog of techniques from throws and locks to holding and locking on the ground. It will probably come as no surprise to seasoned martial artists who have had the opportunity to watch a Shuai Jiao match that the main differences between this art and others is the speed at which techniques are executed upon a subject (one of the reasons Shuai Jiao body training is sooo tough!).Prior to this volume, the only exposure most of us (outside China and Taiwan) had to Shuai Jiao were a few scattered articles dealing with the great fighting master, Chang Tung-sheng, who maintained an incredible level of fitness even beyond his '70's! The one point which is neglected in this book is the importance of striking PRIOR to the execution of a Shuai Jiao technique (Chang Tung-sheng's theory). Of course, Author Liang Shou-yu is from Mainland China and not Taiwan, and may simply offer a path which deviates from Chang's known methods.This book is a vast improvement over other Shuai Chiao books (mostly Chinese language), which limit themselves to a few illustrations. The editors and authors have teamed up to make sure the photographs convey correct direction and motion. A sequel dealing with either competitive Shuai Jiao or advanced applications (striking + locking &amp; throwing) would be most welcome. What a pity this magnificent art isn't more widely known and taught outside of China."},{"Title":"Chinese Fast Wrestling for Fighting: The Art of San Shou Kuai Jiao Throws, Takedowns, & Ground-Fighting","review":"These throws aren't the prettiest throws that you've seen, but they will most certainly get the job done. Unlike Judo, these throws aren't dependent on grabbing your opponents gi. Also, the throws very nasty in that they tie up your opponent so that he will have difficulty breaking his fall - perfect for combat.Take it easy when practicing some of these throws and make sure that your partner knows how to slap out."},{"Title":"Chinese Fast Wrestling for Fighting: The Art of San Shou Kuai Jiao Throws, Takedowns, & Ground-Fighting","review":"What a rare gem of a book! I have studied Jujutsu and Judo, and been a close-combat instructor in the U.S.M.C. I thought I'd seen everything, but this is truly unique. Theres always a new perspective. Its a compilation of some 75 techniques, generally throws and take-downs, in the unique and unconventional manner often found in Chinese martial-arts. This is real Wushu for close-combat! A common critisism that \\"chair-borne rangers\\" and \\"armchair commandos\\" make about various martial-arts books, is the usual nagging about a certain technique \\"not being practical against certain opponents\\". The fact is, any technique can be effective if you develop your skills, and use it in the right circumstance at the right time. A real martial-artist knows this. Its just common sense. You will find many effective techniques portrayed in this book, some techniques that conventional grapplers may not have considered."},{"Title":"Chinese Fast Wrestling for Fighting: The Art of San Shou Kuai Jiao Throws, Takedowns, & Ground-Fighting","review":"This book contains a very good introduction and a _few_ wrestling techniques with lots of good pictures, but some of them apply only to very specific situations. If the author had included more general San Shou techniques, it would become a reference book. The bad part is the layout of the book: the pictures were placed one after the other, with no indication on where a series starts or finishes - some series starts at the middle of a page and ends at the middle of the next - requiring a lot of flipping and attention of the reader."},{"Title":"Chinese Fast Wrestling for Fighting: The Art of San Shou Kuai Jiao Throws, Takedowns, & Ground-Fighting","review":"This small volume on San Shou Kuai Jiao is brimming with good information. It will especially enable kickers &amp; punchers to ascend the next level in their fighting. The written content provides very lucid principles to understand the Chinese view of the well-trained fighter. The pictures are definitely some of the best I've seen in a martial arts book with clear and high-contrasting photographs marked with arrows to dilineate the intermediate principles of motion. The layout is logical starting with general principles, then progressing to stances, warm-ups and exercises, then followed by techniques (which are subdivided further by application methods ie. holding leg throws, leg hooking techniques, throwing techniques, etc.). This little known art is a formidable tool in any fighter's arsenal. For those of you who are looking for Hollywood techniques that look pretty---THIS BOOK IS NOT FOR YOU. All others will find this a very well thought out book that shows the strength of San Shou---getting the job done and getting the fight over with as fast as possible. I definitely would look forward to seeing more from this team of authors."},{"Title":"Chinese Fast Wrestling for Fighting: The Art of San Shou Kuai Jiao Throws, Takedowns, & Ground-Fighting","review":"The throws are well done, especially the clear explanations with arrows and numbering (something lacking in most martial arts books). However, the entries are a little bit contrived and a student would have to have a little knowledge to see how they would REALLY work. The last chapter is about groundfighting and is quite useless for a beginner as it only shows finishing submission holds and gives no instruction on how to move on the ground or set up the holds."},{"Title":"Chinese Fast Wrestling for Fighting: The Art of San Shou Kuai Jiao Throws, Takedowns, & Ground-Fighting","review":"I teach Yoshinkan Aikido and also have dan ranks in Judo and Jujutsu. When I look at other arts I usually look for things that will blend well with these arts and offer ideas that may help take them to another level. That is what first interested me in the Chinese forms of the throwing, grappling and joint locking arts. After reading books and watching videos on Chinna, I turned to this book for further knowledge and understanding. I found what I was looking for.The book starts off by giving some historical background, which brings an important understanding of the origins and intent of the art. It then briefly discusses other styles of wrestling so that the reader can understand how this method differs from others. This is followed by a section on the general principles of San Shou Kuai Jiao. These are \\"the things that make it work\\" and what make the art what it is.Many books are just pictures of techniques and are quite impossible to learn anything from. You can look at the pictures and see positions, but you can not see the science behind the art. This book gives the reader an introduction to the science, mentality and strategy that need to be learned and applied in order to make the techniques functional.There is a section on \\"basic training\\" that shows warm up exercises and conditioning drills to help develop the physical skills that will also be needed to perform the techniques.The last 5 chapters are the techniques. Each chapter addresses a different category of techniques and shows. The explanations are clear and there are \\"key points\\" covered after each description. The photos are sufficient to illustrate the techniques. There is also a chapter on \\"ground fighting\\" which is vitally important in today's martial art's world.I generally advise trying to learn martial arts strictly from books and videos. There is only so much that can be accomplished through these media. But I think that this book accomplishes more than the typical \\"how to\\" martial arts book. From reading this book, I have a good understanding of the basics of this art and it's differences and similarities to mine. I am comfortable with trying to incorporate some of this material into my martial arts training and will keep this book handy to use as a reference over time."},{"Title":"Chinese Fast Wrestling for Fighting: The Art of San Shou Kuai Jiao Throws, Takedowns, & Ground-Fighting","review":"I am a Western Martial Artist studying the art of Fiore.

The main point is the explanation of throwing techniques very different from the ones coming from the Japanese tradition. Very fast, quite simple and very effective, really the highest result with the less effort. From a technical point of view I found that these techniques just throw the opponent away making the landing not controlled. For this reason I highly recommend to not to tray the techniques if you don't already have specific training. Good to buy but be careful on applying it."},{"Title":"Chinese Fast Wrestling for Fighting: The Art of San Shou Kuai Jiao Throws, Takedowns, & Ground-Fighting","review":"Having studied judo, I was really attracted to this art and bought the book to learn. I find a lot of excellent information, very good photography but not very good explanations/layout. An accompanying DVD would be very helpful, in order to master the solo exercises (judo has limited katas, Chuai Shiao has excellent solo work) and throws. Described by some as ' bad judo', this system shows a unique way of shearing the opponents as opposed to only unbalancing as in judo. Unfortunately there are not enough qualified teachers of this system, a real shame as it is an ancient art but very applicable to self defense and combat. This book has excellent information which one can make one's own."},{"Title":"Chinese Fast Wrestling for Fighting: The Art of San Shou Kuai Jiao Throws, Takedowns, & Ground-Fighting","review":"Curious about the vaunted talents of martial artist Cung Le, I picked up this book to study the style he brought into the mixed martial arts scene.

The last chapter is on groudfighting and can teach any wrestler how to use his balance and experience on the ground to make your opponent submit instead of just pinning them. It does help if you have a little experience in a wrestling like sport (judo,jujitsu) just so you know how to control your weight and your opponents. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!"},{"Title":"Chinese Fast Wrestling for Fighting: The Art of San Shou Kuai Jiao Throws, Takedowns, & Ground-Fighting","review":"Anyone with a background in Judo, jujitsu or wrestling will recognize many of these techniques and appreciate studying the variations presented. I agree with other reviewers that some techniques are not practical against a larger, stronger or skilled opponent. One disadvantage with grappling arts is that a technique can literally tie you up with one person. Nevertheless, there are several moves demonstrated in this book that can be applied and/or modified to off-balance and \\"direct\\" one opponent quickly into others."},{"Title":"Chinese Fast Wrestling for Fighting: The Art of San Shou Kuai Jiao Throws, Takedowns, & Ground-Fighting","review":"I have been involved in the martial arts for over 25 years and the vast majority of books on the subject(along with the authors who have written them) are a joke.

You'll be glad you made the author's acquaintance."},{"Title":"On philosophical style (A Midland book)","review":"Blanshard's text is an enjoyable read and strangely hilarious with such gems as \\"A philosopher who is precious, mannered, or self-conscious is a bore, either in person or on paper.\\" His peculiar need for every sentence to be accessible to Blanshard's standards leads him to side with Reichenbach's critique of Hegel's prose as being misleading because Hegel, of all things, does not use the term \\"reason\\" as it is \\"generally used.\\" I would think it might be the end of philosophy if philosophers only used terms as they had been used before. Oh, sorry, Plato, but we don't use eidos that way. But all of this frumpy analytic harrumphing over philosophy is itself part of the curious charm of this book. It is like watching a eloquent old eccentric man chastise the youth of today. Now, could we imagine previous greats in philosophy as achieving even greater heights if they had bothered cleaning up their prose? Or is the density of the material part of its message? Blanshard believes that because there are eloquent philosophers, it cannot be the case that obscurity is required for good philosophy. \\"Berkeley proved against all the Heideggers of the world that philosophy can be written clearly, against all the Hegels that it can be written simply, against all the Kants that it can be written with grace.\\" Suffering through Hegel or Kant seems a rite of passage, but I do have to agree with Blanshard after suffering through some impenetrable contemporary philosophy articles the other day that a little grace would be welcome."},{"Title":"Knives: An Illustrated Encyclopedia of Knives for Fighting, Hunting, and Survival","review":"Being one of the man's oldest tools, the knife has a lot of material to work with, trying to sum it up in a single volume of only 144 pages it's really an enormous challenge that the author tries to tame with some success, but to call the book an encyclopedia is misleading, it can be called a good reference, but since it contains too many personal opinions and absolute truths, that can't be upholded even now, that the scientific sense that the word encyclopedia infers is lost; the substantial references to commercial knives and products available only in some places and in a given time (even tough no longer available at the date of the publishing) makes this a short lived and forgettable book."},{"Title":"Knives: An Illustrated Encyclopedia of Knives for Fighting, Hunting, and Survival","review":"Pat Farey's \\"Knives\\" is more of an introduction to knives, than a detailed encyclopedia covering specific knives or specific knife types.

This set of discs made it very easy. The repetition used (called the \\"Pimsleur Method\\") worked really well for me. I found myself repeating phrases from the CD's in my head long after listening to them. This is a great way to pick up a new language."},{"Title":"Arabic (Eastern), Conversational: Learn to Speak and Understand Eastern Arabic with Pimsleur Language Programs (Pimsleur Instant Conversation)","review":"Perfect for beginners wanting to learn Arabic. The lessons proceed at a reasonable pace, and the pronunciation is clear and easy to understand. Each lesson is 30 minutes and you do only one lesson a day. Don't exceed this recommendation and try to squeeze in an extra lesson or two a day. The reason for one lesson a day is to allow the learning to sink in before moving on. However, you should budget an hour a day for the lesson, because if you are like me, you will want to repeat the same lesson again that day. The CDs teach the \\"academic\\" form of Arabic, rather than any regional dialect. As explained, this is roughly akin to learning British English. It might sound a bit unusual in the U.S. or Australia, but it would not hinder communication. Again, this product is ideal for beginners, but anyone with some exposure to Arabic might find the pace a bit slow."},{"Title":"Arabic (Eastern), Conversational: Learn to Speak and Understand Eastern Arabic with Pimsleur Language Programs (Pimsleur Instant Conversation)","review":"I got this program to compliment the other books and software for learning arabic that I have collected over the past few months.This program does indeed teach the basics but it is almost too basic. I am currently working through the 5th lesson. The later lessons introduce concepts that were introduced in the first lesson but it becomes tediously repetitive. I can't remember the number of times I was prompted to say \\"I am American\\" as this is one of the phrases learned in earlier lessons. Half way through the entire program, I have only learned a handful (&lt;20) of phrases. As the lessons come on audio CDs, I think it would have been a more effective program if it cut down on the repetition in lieu of adding more vocabulary/phrases. One only then needs to replay the CD if they felt they were not yet ready to progress to the next lesson.Although these audio CDs may be effective for people with ZERO arabic knowledge, it would be too basic and repetetive for anyone with past exposure. The program teaches the Syrian dialect arabic and the language is not outdated. The speakers in the program are native speakers and the speech is pristinely clear."},{"Title":"Arabic (Eastern), Conversational: Learn to Speak and Understand Eastern Arabic with Pimsleur Language Programs (Pimsleur Instant Conversation)","review":"As most Pimsleur programs this is an excellent one on EASTERN Arabic spoken in Syria and Lebanon. Unfortunately as all Pimsleur products it suffers from two disadvantages: no script of the dialogues and the formality of the language used. I found Beginner's Arabic by Living Language much easier to learn from. It gives you the chance to download the audioscript and the language used is more realistic. Why can't Pimsleur do this?"},{"Title":"Arabic (Eastern), Conversational: Learn to Speak and Understand Eastern Arabic with Pimsleur Language Programs (Pimsleur Instant Conversation)","review":"I have used Pimsleur products to learn Spanish and Italian.

BTW, the dialect of Arabic used in this product is Syrian/Lebanese. That is what I was looking for so it worked out well for me.I definitely love the Pimsleur method.

But the deli where I buy my pizza is run by Syrian family, so I figured why not. I must not learn to quickly as I have to go over the lessons many times but then all of a sudden it clicks and I'm off and running. This happens for each lesson. I use it as I drive to work and before you know it you've gone through the 18 lessons. I believe it to be a great way to learn and I'm not wasting time just driving to work. As for some of the other reviews you can pick Eastern or Egyptian Arabic CD's. If you picked the wrong one, you picked the wrong one. The program basically, without telling you, breaks all verbs in feminine, masculine, and personal \\"I\\" form, what ever that is. Like they stated in the small introduction which maybe most don't read, you don't learn your own language by learning mas.fem you just learn how to speak it by hearing it and speaking it. I learn best by reading. If they would have given a script with the audio as I think they should have, it would have been, for me, a great way to further my learning. However, I highly recommend this way of learning a spoken language. It's just like learning a new song on the radio. After a while your just singing along and at the end of the 18 lessons you have learned counting, time,and many phrases dealing with eating, drinking, buying, hotels, streets, restaurants, how are you, masc, fem. for day and night and may other verbs with out specifically telling you and putting different words and phrases together in order to make countless phrases. Conversations are usually between a man and a woman. It's truly an amazing way to learn Don't stop the discs early, the 18 lesson set is great for about 30 dollars. Can't beat it with a stick. I did not write this review to sound smart or sophisticated, which I'm not, just to let you know it's a great product which someone like me can learn. Yes I bought the 18 CD set for appr. $30.00.

It's also nice how they'll go over something, move on to something else, and then go back to what you learned before. Read all the information about it... it's true to what they claim. Although they did say to move on to the next lesson if you only got 80% of the lesson, I did go back over the lessons again, but they say that it is important to keep moving to keep motivated. I'm using some of what I've learned already with Arabic speakers.The only problem that I've run into (yes, you do have the dialect problem, but you'll have that with every language program) is that sometimes I may not know exactly how to pronounce something, of course the Arabic/English speakers are able to correct some of those problems. (ie- there was a very silent \\"m\\" sound before a word that I was saying, and I didn't hear it on the CD, but my friends helped me.It has given me the confidence to try out what I know with those I come in contact with."},{"Title":"Arabic (Eastern), Conversational: Learn to Speak and Understand Eastern Arabic with Pimsleur Language Programs (Pimsleur Instant Conversation)","review":"I really like the Pimsleur approach to speaking a foreignlauguage.

One has to consider history and there is a soft French influence over Syrian and Lebanese dialect. Once you learn one way the rest are easy. I am Syrian and have a hard time understanding Egyptians because they slur and speak quickly. Here is an example of dialect: An Egyptian may say Kahwa for coffee but a Syrian would say Ahwa. The K is considered harsh and is softened. An Egyptian may saw Farewa for strawberry but we say Fraise like in French. One disc would be repetitive to teach all dialects.

Please note that the review is not about the exact product on this page. I have not tried the product on this page, which may be slightly different. I had ordered Eastern Arabic CD from Pimsluer directly for a trial membership of $9.99. A month later another box with several CDs arrived. It never tells the amount that I will be billed. It clearly says I will owe nothing if I return it in 30 days or less. A month later another box arrived. Now they think I should graduate into another program of Eastern Arabic. Again, no amount was mentioned. They will continue to charge the credit card. Overall, the product is good, but I did not like their billing practice. If you want to buy their product, buy it from Amazon. You will know what you will pay. Do not order from Pimsleur website. That website has misleading billing practice. When I called them, the lady said the billing info was in the website. What, can't you just write the amount on the packaging slip? Good product, but bad business practice. It is a shame.Update on Dec 1, 2012: On 23rd Nov, the rep from Pimsleur had promised that no further billing. On Nov 29, there is a new charge of $64 from these scam artists. Now I read a review at language 101 dot com. Please see this review to learn about their billing practice. I wish I had read that site earlier. I may become poorer by $1035 by the time they are done billing. Hope this review will alert you not to order from Pimsleur website.

Does your attic bulge with things you might find a use for someday? Are you always looking for new, innovative decorating ideas?Answer \\"yes\\" to any of those questions and the \\"Salvage Sisters Guide\\" will kindle a kindred spark. Like a year's subscription to a decorating magazine for yard salers, their colorful, perky and practical book teems with ideas, good and bad.Some of the good ideas are familiar. A patchwork quilt (or ottoman cover, tablecloth or lampshade-cum-chandelier cover), made out of your family's long-loved old clothes, for instance. Or the ball gown cut down for a table skirt. And I don't know that I've ever seen a cast-iron lobster-shaped cornbread mold used as a doorknocker, but it seems like I should have.Then there's the bad ideas; who hasn't seen a nifty looking throw tucked neatly over an old chair's fraying upholstery? Looks great, as long as nobody sits on it. Making outfits for the whole family out of a couple of big, ugly curtains makes for a funny picture, but I wouldn't want to try it on my family. And I get the distinct feeling that most of the newsprint ideas - wreaths, mirror-frame covers, urns filled with crinkled balls - look a lot better in the pictures than in real life. As for shell art; it's downright dangerous.But the twin-bed headboard set over the plain horizontal mirror (or door frame) really does smarten up the piece and the hundred and one uses for an old wine rack (from shoe rack to spa closet) are all inspirational. Plant stands make chair-side serving trays, umbrella stands, and even a whimsical toilet tissue stand.The toilet tissue stand perfectly expresses the Salvage Sisters' philosophy: \\"Why tuck toilet tissue behind closed doors when you can make an amusing arrangement of it in plain sight on a plant stand? The best part: There's no risk of unknowingly running out.\\"A lot of their ideas require no work at all or just a simple lick of pain or spot of glue. But where more is required - such as hanging an old front-door pediment over a set of standard French doors, or making bookcases from discarded drawers or covering a straight-backed chair seat - detailed directions include all materials and tools needed as well as step-by-step instructions suitable for a person with no skills or experience.Colorful pictures accompany everything and often feature family members, from kids on driftwood swings to husbands in homemade bow ties. Jackie the terrier is a frequent model in his sweater made from an old sleeve, his ball-fringe leash, and his charmingly decorated bedroom with the birdbath-stand night table (the bath basin is on the dining room table).With words of wisdom like, \\"Rust is a variation of red; red is always an acceptable color\\" and \\"Never worry about how to get it home; just get it,\\" the sisters have a make-do, can-do style that is as useful as it is humorous.-- Portsmouth Herald"},{"Title":"The Salvage Sisters' Guide to Finding Style in the Street and Inspiration in the Attic","review":"A very disappointing book considering the write-ups in home decor magazines.

This title is one of them. Celestial Fire of Ma'at (truth) surges throughout these electrifying pages of this extremely well written book. The author has recaptivated the Masonic Egregore, taking the reader through a wonderland of detailed interpretations of esoteric lore in regards to Masonic rituals, Masonic principles, as they are supposed to be executed, lived by and practiced. Furthermore, he pints out vividly, how in many cases, Masonic Lodges have slipped into practices which are no longer of that esoteric quality, ritualistic pureness in intent and execution, as hierarchically ordained from times immemorial. This book truly is an eye-opener for every Mason! It is not to say, that non-Masonic readers would walk away from it bored. Quite to the contrary; in spite of some coded material, it enhances the state of well-being the reader will unmistakably experience, as he/she progresses through the pages. Every Mason should be in possession of this book, being gifted by the author's absolutely clear, expressive understanding of the highest esoteric principles, and how they WILL BE incorporated again, in this coming Millenium by a decree of Highest Forces at play, for the well-being and safe execution of every practicing Brother and Sister Mason, to the betterment of Mankind.

But I was struck by the conflicting perceptions of it by searchers or new agers or ordinary Masons. I've spen most of my life amid Masons and agree that most American practioners, over 50 at least, would find this book twaddle and irrelevant to their Masonic experiences. Their sense of the history of Masonry tends to be either the symbolic story in the rituals or the political American one (Washington was a Mason, ...). The more accurate history, which interweaves with that of much of the &quot;New Age,&quot; is lost: the Rosy-Crossers, the Renaissance Hermeticists, the late Medieval Qabalists, and the ancient precursors back into at least the second century BCE. Against that history, the rituals take on a very different meaning and point to very different types of experiences -- which might not be welcome to many more conventional Masons and which inevitably resemble the cousin customs in non-traditional (the main official traditions, that is) spiritualities. Insofar as this book illuminates all this, it should be priceless (but earlier books along this line have yielded to the temptation to bring ALL the author's favorite cult in, even the parts from Irish fairies or laudanum hallucinations)."},{"Title":"Freemasonry in the Twenty-First Century","review":"This book is a very good occult treatise on Freemasonry. For those who are looking for a more mundane explanation of what goes on in a Masonic Lodge, I would advise you to look elsewhere. This is not for you. This book is for occultists who understand the need or at least the tradition of veiling certain details of occult workings from the uninitiated, hence the many abbreviations of words with which many are already familiar. Bradley speaks so heavily of the &quot;Masters&quot; in this work, that if the reader doesn't already have at least a certain respect for the notion of Ascended Masters, he or she will undoubteldy scoff at the entire book - and many reviews here prove this. In spite of this, the book contains much very good information. I doubt &quot;mundane&quot; Masons will read through the occult leanings in the book to get to it, or trust it if they do, however, so only 4 stars.

It is important for those to read Psalm 135 and understand the meaning.

The word craft essentially means : skill, cunning, deciet (ummm..), and trickory!. Beware Masons believers in Jesus are onto you."},{"Title":"Freemasonry in the Twenty-First Century","review":"Having read and studied minutely the issues surrounding Freemasonry, this book at least looks at each degree and finally explains what is going on. No other book does that."},{"Title":"Freemasonry in the Twenty-First Century","review":"As a Freemason seeing the numerous and strongly polarized opinions about this book, I could not resist reading it. I found the author presents his own personal theology and spirituality as absolute truth and &quot;real freemasonry&quot; while angrily criticizing, even denigrating those of his brother Masons who do not share his particular beliefs.The world view underlying Bradley's discussion of Freemasonry's rituals can be briefly described as follows: The physical world is a false shadow of higher, more 'real' planes of existence, such as the astral and angelic planes. These higher planes of existence are populated by various angels, archons, planetary rulers, self-actualized beings, and spirit guides (such as the grand master Rakoczi, spirit guide to all 'true' Masons). The 'planetary rulers' guide the evolution of humanity toward realization of their existence on the higher planes by sending messengers (such as Moses, Buddha, Jesus &amp; Francis Bacon) to humanity as we are able to absorb their lessons. Each individual soul progresses toward the higher planes through numerous reincarnations. Freemasonry is a &quot;school of the lesser mysteries&quot; through which a prepared and disciplined being can make his progress, while its' rituals are white magic that focuses and elevates cosmic energy, magnetism, rays and vibrations for the benefit of humanity. Most masons hold far more conventional beliefs. It is certainly understandable that they might object to Bradley's 'Truth'. This book is an excellent example of why religion is not discussed in Masonic Lodges.What I find disturbing about this book is not the content so much as the tone. Bradley might have found more agreement if he had simply pointed out - with humility and charity rather than pride and self righteousness - that character development and increasing self knowledge are rarely emphasized activities in Freemasonry despite all the references to these in the ritual and the Craft's stated objective of &quot;making good men better.&quot; He might have offered his particular suggestions for improving matters in a manner &quot;offensive to none and beneficial to all&quot;, as freemasons are urged to do. Instead he chooses to characterize those who do not share his belief as agents of darkness bent on corrupting what he sees as the original, occult nature of Freemasonry. His hostility does not indicate to me that he is the &quot;evolved, self-actualized&quot; spirit he imagines himself to be, but rather is still very much wrapped up in his &quot;not-self, or ego&quot;, to use his own terminology. The attitude Bradley displays in his book is sadly not in conformity with his own description of a 'true' Master Mason. His apparently spiritual writing is thus revealed to be no more than a vain intellectual exercise.But even as an intellectual exercise this work does have some value. I found his lengthy discussion of the symbols of Freemasonry in particular to be refreshing and thought provoking. This part of the book might be tough going for non-masons as the symbols are not named, but only abbreviated. So Tracing Board is T:. B:. and twenty four inch gauge is T...F...I...G... Unless you already know the symbols and ceremonies, or have researched them, much of the book will not make much sense."},{"Title":"Freemasonry in the Twenty-First Century","review":"According to the introduction to his book, Mr. Bradley claims to be a Mason, Rosicrucian, author, composer, syndicated columnist, classical musician, credentialed teacher, network engineer and much more.... He says, &quot;In the course of writing this book I received little encouragement from my so-called brothers.&quot; and Masons will understand why when they read that Mr. Bradley believes one of the two primary functions of Masonry is &quot;To aid all life on our planet through the use of ceremonial White Magic.&quot; Interestingly, and not unexpectedly, nowhere is the author's Masonic membership data given. The picture on the back cover shows a person of quite young age supposedly living in the hills of Los Angeles when &quot;...not travelling in search of new worlds and ancient wisdom.&quot; A couple of online posters have stated their belief that this was an exceptionally moving book; others, however, have replied that they wished they had not wasted the money. We believe it is wrongly classified as 'Non-fiction'. The bibliography is revealing: only thirteen authors are cited and just two of them are by Masons (although even those are suspect in that one citation is for Albert Pike while the other is Manley Hall's &quot;The Lost Keys of Freemasonry&quot; written at the age of twenty-one, some thirty years before Hall became a Mason).Bradley has many more quotes including those from Alice Bailey, an occultist, and the various Yoga masters from the bibliography. He writes exhaustively about what he perceives to be the lessons and reactions to the degrees of Freemasonry - and in some few cases, actually touches upon reality. With far too many of his examples, however, he makes great leaps and assumptions which no one (Mason or not) would, should, or could ever presuppose as the actual purpose or teaching of the degrees. While the cover is appealing, the book's contents and fanciful claims leave much to be desired. We feel this work is poor fiction which many Masons will be duped into buying simply because of its title. WE CERTAINLY DO NOT RECOMMEND IT!Apparently Bradley since writing this book moved to Colorado and having not been able to earn an honest living high-tailed it back to California to avoid debts. Bradley does not live as he preaches."},{"Title":"Freemasonry in the Twenty-First Century","review":"This book is a complete waste of money. The cutesy &quot;encryption&quot; of key phrases (C... and S...) is annoying enough, but the authors arrogant assertion that true students will be able to understand what he is *not* saying really takes the cake.

I'm certain that Freemasonry deserves better."},{"Title":"Freemasonry in the Twenty-First Century","review":"I do not believe that this book represents what our Craft will be like in the 21st century. Nonetheless, the writer is certainly free to interpret the allegory and symbolism as he sees fit. I would not recommend this book to the newly initiated ( except in the Lodges that consist predominantly of Eastern thought, New Age followers, etc.) I would, however, recommend it to serious students of the Craft who are interested in seeing how Freemasonry is &quot;instructive to all, and offensive to none.&quot; For those who enjoyed this book, take a look at &quot;The Meaning of Masonry ; W. L. Wilmhurst.&quot; I appreciate Bradley sharing his views as much as I enjoy the books by Mackey et.al. who take a different approach to the Craft."},{"Title":"Freemasonry in the Twenty-First Century","review":"I truly believe the author's motives were sincere. He makes a good point here and there - though those points and discussions are far from original.

Save your money."},{"Title":"Freemasonry in the Twenty-First Century","review":"I don't know what to make of this book. This book makes Freemasonry out to be some sort of new age religion with brothers going through all these 'mystical expirences'. I remember many emotions from when I was becoming a Mason, but nothing like what this books says a canidate should feel. Although the tone of the book is very pro-Mason, I think what the author views as Masonry and what the majority of Masons view as Masonry are totaly different. I see this book as contributing to a lot of miss information that is out there about Freemasonry today."},{"Title":"Freemasonry in the Twenty-First Century","review":"It is almost like a book for someone into the new age movement.

In laymens terms &quot;it is kind of like buying a monopoly game, introducing or changing a couple of rules and moves, then repackaging it with a slightly different name&quot;.The author studied under Torkum Saraydarian for a while before achieving his self appointed spiritual mastery of New Age nothingness. He has migrated his studies to UFO's as last we heard. That should be enough for anyone.GC"},{"Title":"Freemasonry in the Twenty-First Century","review":"This book is WORTHLESS and let me give you a few reasons why:1. From page 1, the author states that one of the two main purposes of Freemasonry is \\"to aid all life on our planet through the use of ceremonial White Magic\\". I can guarantee that ANY Grand Master of any Grand Lodge in the world would tell you that Freemasonry does not now, nor has not ever has been connected with White Magic.2. The book tries to connect new age mumbo jumbo (which most people won't understand anyway, even seasoned Masons) with Freemasonry. Any connection between the two only exists in the mind of the author. The most extreme example used by the author is that there is a \\"Solar Angel\\" named Master Rakoczi that oversees Freemasonry throughout time.3. Even experienced Masons will have a difficult time trying to read and interpret the \\"code\\" language used throughout the book. The author uses code writing because he's afraid of revealing Masonic secrets, which is absolutely ludicrous because he encodes words, phrases and titles that aren't meant (or never were meant) to be secret! For example, he doesn't even dare write \\"Jacob's Latter\\", so instead writes \\"J...B's L...r\\" or\\"B..z\\" for Boaz and \\"J...n\\" for Jachin (all which are biblical terms, not necessarily Masonic secrets. He goes so overboard with these code writings, which makes this book quite a painful read.4. He presents his ideas and opinions about Freemasonry as if he has the authority to suggest the way things should be. For example that an Entered Apprentice apron should be pure white, a Fellowcraft apron should be dark blue boardered and a Master's apron should be made with REAL gold thread so that it can be magnetized by the energy in the rituals.5. He presents his interpretation of symbolism of Freemasonry as fact, never stating that his words are his own opinion. One such example is his insinuation that an apron is worn in Masonic ritual to block energy from reaching the sexual areas of the body, so that Masons don't get aroused during lodge meeting, or to protect them from letting out animalistic desires. In fact, he claims that some can become ill or \\"freak out\\" if they don't wear their apron during lodge meetings.This guy is so far out in left field when it comes to Freemasonry. It's people like him that make non-Masons look at the Craft and think that the Lodge is full of wierdos! There are MANY books with far better lessons. Don't waste your time or money."},{"Title":"The Ballad of Beta-2 b/w Alpha Yes, Terra No!

I agree with the other reviewer: Ballad of Beta-2 is a quick and interesting mystery, highly recommended. The other tale that it is bound with, in my copy, Empire Star, is more complex (and not as haunting), but still a rewarding bit of short Delany SF. Delany can be very bizarre (as in Dhalgren) but he can also write good old-fashioned SF. !"},{"Title":"The Ballad of Beta-2 b/w Alpha Yes, Terra No! (Ace Double)","review":"Here is the story of mankind's first, and unsuccessful, attempt to colonize another planet.A dozen slow, multi-generation ships were sent to a distant star system called the Leffer System. Soon afterwards, mankind developed a star drive, so that by the time the ships reached their destination, mankind had been traveling around the galaxy for a hundred years. Of the dozen ships, two arrived empty, and two others never arrived at all. The ships were simply parked in orbit, and abandoned. Beta-2, one of the ships, even has its own ballad. Years later, as a college assignment, Joneny, a young researcher, is sent to find out just what happened.Several of the supposedly indestructible ships show evidence of huge internal explosions. Some old audio recordings talk of being attacked by some sort of green humanoid that communicates by telepathy. Joneny meets the humanoid's half-human son, who is able to exist slightly outside of time, and live in hard vaccuum with no problem at all. He watches video from the other ships where the inhabitants have physically, and mentally, de-evolved to the level of an early human. \\"The Norm\\" is taken very seriously on the ships. If a person was found to be outside physical norms in any way, whether it's being too tall, or left-handed, or having the \\"wrong\\" eye color, they were immediately executed. By the end, Joneny understands just what The Ballad of Beta-2 is all about.This is a short novel, but a very good one. It's an interesting story about how things on a multi-generation ship can go very wrong, and it's worth reading."},{"Title":"The Ballad of Beta-2 b/w Alpha Yes, Terra No! (Ace Double)","review":"Joneny is a student of galactic anthropology and is given the task of decoding \\"The Ballad of Beta-2.\\" Beta-2 was one among a group of multi-generational spaceships moving between the stars where the crew was killed, leaving only a song that was an obvious metaphor for the events leading to their deaths. His search took him to the damaged ships and after some solid detective work and exploration; he was able to learn that civil order broke down in the ships. The moral authority gained dominance over the civil, leading to people being executed for being outside the norm, which included everything from height and weight to political and religious opinions.Within the destruction, there was the birth of a new species, based on a crossbreed between humans and another species. The captain of the Beta-2 was impregnated, and was able to have the fetus removed and kept with the other fetuses held in storage for the trip. However, when the moral authority learned of the deviance of her pregnancy, she was executed. Fortunately, a sympathetic doctor was able to shield the resulting fetus from destruction and the new species of mind-reading humanoids was created and Joneny learns the meaning of the ballad, as it chronicles the largely self-destruction of the people on the ship.As humans move out into space, no one really knows what wonders and other species will be encountered. Furthermore, no one knows how long-term space travel will affect the humans in the ships. Physical laws prevent interstellar travel in anything other than multi-generational ships and it is clear that the society that begins the trek will not necessarily be the same one that ends it. Furthermore, humans being what they are, it is also very possible that the society will destroy itself via internal conflict. In this story, Delany explores both of these events and sets forward interesting ideas about what fate human cargo ships will face when they attempt to move between the stars. While the story is not compellingly written, it certainly meets the bar of worth reading."},{"Title":"The Ballad of Beta-2 b/w Alpha Yes, Terra No!

Could not put it down. Lord Michael is a romantic disciplinarian, and Elizabeth his spoiled charge. It reminded me a little of Pride and Prejudice, with D/s added in. Very hot, graphic sex scenes, and some very entertaining situations.Having read all three, I have to put Malibu Heat as my favorite, probably because I have always enjoyed books about Hollywood and the rich and famous. Malibu is such a great location for a book. And it's more of a mainstream novel than the other two. But I can't separate Deja Vu and Elizabeth's Education. They are tied for a very close second. I am waiting now, for more books from Maggie Carpenter. At least I hope there are more coming. I think I have a new favorite writer."},{"Title":"Elizabeth's Education","review":"There's something quite wonderful about this novel. It's beautifully written and the characters are alive and easy to 'see'. Lord Michael is a strict disciplinarian but one can feel his kind, caring, nurturing soul underneath. The manner in which this author brings us along the journey reminds me of another book I once read, where I felt as if I was peeking through a keyhole at the lives of the characters. I really loved this book and can absolutely give it a five star rating. Highly Recommend."},{"Title":"Elizabeth's Education","review":"Imagine a woman of stature and worth, who demands a snap of attention from her loyal servants becoming a lust craved submissive filled with wants, desires, and needs herself, ending up at the hands of a skilled Dominant who takes her through a world of discovery as she succumbs to her own diverse desires. That is just what the author portrays in this beautiful and wanton look at the training of a this submissive named Elizabeth. She is somewhat smitten with this gentlemen who we find has his own designs on her as they enter into a temporary arranged setting that encourages their involvement.Enter Lord Michael, an established gentlemen of old England who has embraced his standing and respect as one who lives the style and life of the time. A time when the men of society demanded respect through the use of corporal punishment and other sensual based methods to keep their women in line. The use of such techniques establishes for themselves an erotic necessity and convenience in the submissiveness of their companions. And often, a woman who is a bit feisty and perhaps journeys with a mind of her own, is uniquely embraced as a good find. Elizabeth is just that kind of woman and we soon find that her training will take much to bring the end result, a woman who loves her master and aches to please him in every way and whim he presents.Maggie Carpenter's self proclaimed submissiveness and understanding of the D/s culture again gives us a wonderful look at the mentality and angst of becoming truly submissive to a proper Dominant gentlemen. We are taken through the first spank of a surprised aristocrat to her assuming role as a submissive who will endure all it takes to appease the Dominant she has fallen in love with. We experience a whole host of rituals and rules, along with sensory and psychological restraints, and of course a diverse use of corporal punishments and implements to enhance the story and give the reader a profound look at Dominance and submission.Elizabeth's Education had me from the start as the two main character's attraction and unique tastes began to merge. The author uniquely gives us stark look at the Dominant and submissive culture as it was in London of old, and yet, you can grasp this life-style presented in a current D/s culture, rich in ritual, understanding, discipline and love.If you're looking for a story of Dominance and submission with all the compelling elements and a fairytale story of romance, this book will not disappoint. Maggie Carpenter is known for her powerful use of life-style cultured events and disciplines and has again given us a true and heartfelt look in this book. I highly recommend it, but would caution, once you read one of her books, you will be back for more. Thank you Maggie, for a wonderful provocative book."},{"Title":"Elizabeth's Education","review":"This book started off fine, thats why I purchased it.

It also includes other tourist information for the event cities as well, but it's by no means a comprehensive guide. Usually a travel guide book can be rated by measuring the details and information of a city you know well first and then either trusting or not trusting the info for other cities. In the case of this guide, one would have to go by event. My litmus test was San Diego's Street Scene and while I guess it was decent advice, it seems to be directed at two different factions of people --- college-aged kids without personal taste of their own and these kids when they grow up and make a bunch of money, yet still think they are the young sheep of their past. While some of the events and some of the clubs are catering to the younger set, the prices for the hotels, bars and eateries are in the range and style of those old enough to make good money. I found this to be the case not only in San Diego, but in Las Vegas & Chicago as well. As for Taste of Chicago -- that's NOT a reason to go to the city. It's super hot & humid during that time of year -- so who wants to pig out under the sun? Of all the fantastic annual events held in Chicago, this one was questionable.

This book is so easy to read and so interesting. Definitely a good buy if you're not into fiction and like books that are meaningful to read."},{"Title":"This Voice in My Heart: A Genocide Survivor's Story of Escape, Faith, and Forgiveness","review":"This Voice in My Heart by Gilbert Tuhabonye (Amistad--May 2006) is a heart wrenching account of what one young man, Mr. Tuhabonye, who, at the time, went by his birth name of Tuhabonyemana--Child of God--went through at a time of extreme political upheaval in his homeland of Burundi. This book is a must-read for those interested in history as well as those who want to know more about what can drive a young man to overcome and not only survive, but make a name for himself.Early on in his story, Mr. Tuhabonye writes, \\"If you were to read the history of Burundi in a schoolbook, it would tell a story very different from the story of my early years. You would read words like war-torn, genocide, impoverished and sanctions. Despite all the violence and unrest that has plagued the country since it first achieved independence in 1962, for me, growing up on its southern hillsides and deep valleys, Burundi was truly a paradise.\\" I imagine this was placed where it was to set the contrast in motion in the reader's mind--that what we get on the news--especially the Western News--is not necessarily what people are experiencing, however it had a different effect to me. Burundi, whether painted in a positive or negative light, hadn't made much of an impact on me. I don't recall spending more than a few moments glossing over the country in history and geography classes so this insider's look told me more than I could ever have expected to know. And though he wrote it as an adult, we got the point of view of a young child peering out at the world from the safety of his campus and trying to make sense of a world gone seemingly mad. An idea that most people born and raised in the relative safety of the USA cannot even begin to imagine.The author also focuses on the little things, which serve as a reminder that material things are not necessary in order to remember times in our lives. If you fix something that's broken there's a chance that you'll lose the story of why it was broken in the first place. And what's more important? The story of the homeland to pass on to future generations or a perfect smile? A smile can always be addressed but a story once gone is lost forever. Mr. Tuhabonye's work with this story is key to making sure the story of the Burundi genocide is not lost. A reminder to the West that we must remember if we're going to avoid repeating history.The story's pace kept the reader engaged in the story--we learned some details of the country's history while at the same time learned the small details of the life of a normal teenage boy--a life seriously interrupted by a snowballing series of events in October 1993.From his recollections of his early days, how he longed to follow his older siblings in both their chores and going to school to the day when his life changed in seemingly an instant, Mr. Tuhabonye covered it all with a voice that seemed more as if he was talking to a few friends rather than such a large audience. It all started on a normal day: a young boy worrying about exams and thinking about a race--never realizing the next race he'd be facing was one to save his own life--to prove he was a true survivor.I cannot imagine what it must have been like to be in a room where your classmates and teachers were dying around me. Dying at the hands of people I'd lived along side of. I cannot imagine having the foresight to use a classmate's bone to free myself, but Mr. Tuhabonye showed us that he has what is needed to succeed.That drive will take him far, whether it's to Beijing in 2008 or to the next location where he speaks of the atrocities he faced, but it will help him to succeed in whatever path he pursues. He's already shown what he's made of."},{"Title":"This Voice in My Heart: A Genocide Survivor's Story of Escape, Faith, and Forgiveness","review":"Reviewed by Mary Simmons for Reader Views (9/06)We have all heard about the genocide that happened in Rwanda and Burundi over a decade ago. We have seen the news clips, read the articles, even watched the movies that have come out in the aftermath. But what was it really like to be a target of hatred and violence and to see hundreds of people around you dying in the most horrible way?Gilbert Tuhabonye lived through this experience and he shares his story in his memoir, \`This Voice in My Heart.' The author, a member of the Tutsi ethnic minority, was a student in October 1993 when his life was changed forever by the violent clash between the Hutu and Tutsi tribes in Burundi. He explains that the Hutus make up the majority of the population in the region, while for years the countries of Rwanda and Burundi have been run by Tutsi governments. That all changes when Hutus take control and violence ensues. While \`This Voice in My Heart' tells the story of a genocide survivor, it is also much more. Tuhabonye tells of his childhood eloquently, describing what it was like to grow up in Burundi. His life was full of hard work and yet he still refers to it fondly as a carefree, innocent existence. Growing up, he endured harsh, rigid circumstances balanced with joy and learning experiences that have served him well. One gets the feeling that he wishes he could go back to this period before violence marred his world so tragically.Up until October 21, 1993, when Tuhabonye and his Tutsi classmates were targeted, he seemed to be living a charmed life. At the age of 18 he had already experienced opportunities others in his country could never dream of. He had proven himself as an athlete, competing in races around the world, and he was planning to accept a scholarship to an American university. He tells of how he won his first official race, gaining confidence when he beat others who were older and stronger than him. He says he realized he could accomplish even more if he trained with a good coach. And while he credits his survival to a higher power, he also acknowledges his training as an athlete as a contributing factor to his ability to make it through the many challenges he faced.In the midst of the brutality, Tuhabonye says he felt tranquil. \\"I heard this voice in my heart say, \`Do not worry. You will survive, Gilbert, you will be fine.\\" That reassuring and measured voice penetrated the din of shouts and pleading.\\" Following the attack, Tuhabonye experienced a variety of emotions: relief, guilt, anger, sorrow, grief and finally forgiveness. Despite his injuries, he was able to come back to the world of racing, attending schools in the States and attending an Olympic development training camp prior to the Atlanta Games in 1996. He is now a coach and motivational speaker and hopes to compete in the 2008 Olympics.\`This Voice in My Heart' is a testament that it is possible to overcome extreme adversity and achieve your goals if you are focused and disciplined. It is an inspirational story of one man's journey to hell and back that gives context to a period of our modern history that no one can ignore.Book received free of charge."},{"Title":"This Voice in My Heart: A Genocide Survivor's Story of Escape, Faith, and Forgiveness","review":"Gilbert's story, told plainly and simply, is inspiring. Without braggadicio or literary embellishment, the incredible events, choices, and actions in Gilbert's life speak for themselves.Gilbert immerses us in his happy childhood in Burundi, despite poverty and constant political and social conflict. Interleaved in stark contrast with the relatively tranquil and traditional coming-of-age tale are vivid minute-by minute descriptions of the day that changed his life, the Hutu massacre of all the Tutsi students at his school. But the story does not end there; Gilbert sets an impressive example of survival, endurance, and dedication that allows him to move forward with his life and his running career despite his injuries.This is a dramatic, almost movie-like story of trauma and triumph, personal strength, friendships and family relationships, injustice and good fortune. It's an athlete biography, a description of African life, and a testament to the horrors of genocide. The graphic nature of the massacre - against children, by some of their teachers - is hard to stomach, more disturbing even than what Hotel Rwanda showed. Gilbert deserves credit for making the end of the story a happy one, against all odds."},{"Title":"This Voice in My Heart: A Genocide Survivor's Story of Escape, Faith, and Forgiveness","review":"This is a captivating life story. Gilbert's portrayal of his path from childhood in Burundi to adult in Austin is candid and vivid. This book truly captures his spirit. While his story is the most impactful part of the book, it is also a cultural study and made me feel grateful for everything I do have. I learned a lot of about Africa as well as about a great Austin citizen."},{"Title":"This Voice in My Heart: A Genocide Survivor's Story of Escape, Faith, and Forgiveness","review":"Although I have only read a little bit so far, this is one of the most inspiring stories I have ever read! To see the hand of God in someone's life, and the gratefulness of heart Gilbert has is wonderful! Encouraging, moving.....truly amazing! A must read for anyone!!!"},{"Title":"This Voice in My Heart: A Genocide Survivor's Story of Escape, Faith, and Forgiveness","review":"If you want to read a story about a person who has experienced such great tragedy but has used the experience to love and forgive and to help end the cycle of hate and educate us to this effect, then this book is for you. The book alternates through stories of school boy life in Burundi, running, and genocide. I am a runner in Austin Texas who hears great things about Gilbert Tuhabonye (now a running coach in Austin), but this is not a running book. This is a book about a man's dream to do well in school in order to get a U.S. college track scholarship. Despite being a victim of unthinkable horror he succeeds in doing so. But his greatest success is his ability to teach forgiveness and the book is a vehicle for doing so. The book is an easy read of a worthwhile tale."},{"Title":"This Voice in My Heart: A Genocide Survivor's Story of Escape, Faith, and Forgiveness","review":"This is a fantastic story of hope & redemption."},{"Title":"This Voice in My Heart: A Genocide Survivor's Story of Escape, Faith, and Forgiveness","review":"On October 21, 1993, Tutsi students and teachers from Burundi's \\"Lycee Kibimba\\" school were bound, stripped, herded into an abandoned building, then attacked with machetes and gasoline by their Hutu classmates, teachers and neighbors.\\"The Voice in My Heart\\" is the story of Gilbert Tuhabonye, survivor of the terrible attack. It tells of his boyhood on a rural farm, tending cows, playing with his friends, and sliding down hills on banana leaves. It tells of his schooling in Burundi's demanding school system and of the religious faith that informed his actions and his ability to cope with the violence he experienced. We learn of his country's political instability and ethnic violence. Gilbert tells how he found and developed his natural talent for running and how hopes of running again enabled his remarkable survive of brutality and the long months of recovery. His will and faith allowed him to become a world-class runner and coach in the United States.The book is wonderful for its depiction of rural life in Africa and for the stark portrayals of betrayed trust and savagery that accompanied the ethic unrest in the 1990s. It's not a feel-good book about the power of faith; Gilbert did not escape unscathed -- physically or mentally -- from his ordeal. His story ends on a rather flat note that suggests that his struggle continues. But as a tale of human resilience in the face of evil, it is quite amazing."},{"Title":"This Voice in My Heart: A Genocide Survivor's Story of Escape, Faith, and Forgiveness","review":"I read the book and loved it so ordered 2 to give as gifts.

How he found guidance through the Voice in his Heart that he has now learned to trust and follow in all decisions."},{"Title":"This Voice in My Heart: A Genocide Survivor's Story of Escape, Faith, and Forgiveness","review":"Pause a bit in your busy life and read this amazing book. The writing style is unique. The message of hope is clear. Genocide on a large scale is a subject we don't understand here in America. Gilbert's story will enlighten you, force you to count your blessings, and make you ponder.The story of early explorations of Africa by David Livingstone is a helpful introduction to this continent. Gilbert's description of his country is very modern - his ordeal began only fourteen years ago. It provides a whole new way of thinking about how Africans lived and now live.I am grateful to my friend in Pa. who shared a copy (signed by Gilbert) of the book with me. It's an unforgettable story about a place in Africa (Burundi) I had never heard of; about running competitions and how qualified runners in developing countries can acquire training, and about a terrible tragedy. Gilbert, a gifted runner, being the lone survivor to give the account.Gilbert details his life, his education, his experience in international running competitions, and his present life in Austin, Texas.Best wishes, Gilbert, for success in the 2008 Olympics. May your story reach every nation. May genocide in Africa and everywhere else in our world be banned. May God continue to bless you and your efforts to build of bridge of understanding and love between nations."},{"Title":"This Voice in My Heart: A Genocide Survivor's Story of Escape, Faith, and Forgiveness","review":"Wonderful book!

They are the stuff nightmares are made of.On the other hand, it seems to me that it is almost impossible to know the full range of what it means to be a human being without reading Gilbert Tuhabonye's memoir. It comes from the greatest heights and abysmal depths of human experience, places few of us have the opportunity or dreadful fortune to visit first hand."},{"Title":"This Voice in My Heart: A Genocide Survivor's Story of Escape, Faith, and Forgiveness","review":"This Voice in My Heart by Gilbert Tuhabonye is an autobiography written by a young man who survived the attempted genocide of the Tutis in Africa. His story is tragic and gives the reader a vivid picture of what happened when the Hutus attempted to wipe out an entire race. Reading his story has made me realize how the heart of man is evil and what atrocities human beings are capable of inflicting upon each other. However, Gilbert's story also tells of a childhood that is full of love. His parents loved and nurtured him and helped him become the responsible and caring adult he is today. This book would be great for anyone who is a runner as Gilbert is also a world-class runner. His running talents almost got him to the Olympics. He was one of the top runners in his country. He writes much about running and training in this book. I found this book to be enjoyable, however, I would have liked the author to go further into how his faith helped him to be a survivor and how his faith helped him to arrive at a place of forgiveness for those who attempted to murder him. While Gilbert does discuss his faith in the book, he doesn't give any scripture references and it is a topic that is not explored deeply."},{"Title":"This Voice in My Heart: A Genocide Survivor's Story of Escape, Faith, and Forgiveness","review":"This book is a superb story of overcoming the odds and followin gyour dreams.Gilbert is a gifted runner and story teller; I highly recommend his book."},{"Title":"This Voice in My Heart: A Genocide Survivor's Story of Escape, Faith, and Forgiveness","review":"I just finished \\"This Voice in My Heart\\", and it is amazing and compelling. I am one of Gilbert's Gazelles, and he has an enormous spirit. He is a fabulous runner and a terrific coach, and more important, a wonderful person with a heart of gold. We all have read about atrocities that have occurred around the world, but to read a first-hand account of these horrible events happening to someone you know, it's really difficult to fathom.Gilert's book is page-turning. The picture he paints of his traditional African childhood on the mountains of Burundi has stayed with me even after I set the book down -- it felt like I was transported to a magical and beautiful place, totally foreign to the frenetic and convenience-driven society in which we live here in America. The descriptions are vibrant and robust and make me appreciate the Burundi culture of agriculture, nature, hard work, music, and tradition.The description of the events of Gilbert's horrific near-death was breath-taking... It was like driving by an awful car accident -- we don't want to see any more because it seems so horrible and unfathomable, but we're drawn to it to learn as much as we can. The writing style of this book is very descriptive and draws the reader in to the situation, making it hard to put the book down.The fact that Gilbert could recover fully, run again, win championships, and forgive is truly remarkable. He has been blessed to lead a full life to date -- with much more happiness to come. That Gilbert could rise from the sadness of that terrible day and embrace happiness and joy in life is a true testament to his tremendous spirit and positive outlook.One of my favorite passages is this:\\"If I were to place on a scale all the bad things that had happened to me and my family on one side and all the kindness and generosity on the other, the goodness in people would far outweigh the bad.\\"This is a story of hope and inspiration, and most important, a lesson to us to never give up in the face of hardship."},{"Title":"This Voice in My Heart: A Genocide Survivor's Story of Escape, Faith, and Forgiveness","review":"\\"This Voice in My Heart\\" is an extraordinary true-life story. Compelling and well-written, this autobiographical account gives readers insight into a remarkable individual living through a horrific experience. Readers will become much more aware of the continued cultural unrest in Burundi and Rwanda but moreover, be amazed at Gilbert's progress from barefoot child living in a hut with no running water or electricity to a college graduate living in the US as a successful professional athlete and coach. \\"This Voice in My Heart\\" will appeal to wide variety of readers - from casual to competitive runners, anyone interested in the ongoing dispute between the Tutsi and Hutus, or anyone who enjoys an account of how a relationship with God can guide an individual through what seems to be an impossible situation.What this book does not capture is how wonderful it is to meet or be coached by Gilbert. Rather than shy and untrusting, Gilbert is always giving, offering laughter and encouragement for all those he touches and is a powerful positive influence with an outstanding spirit. Most readers won't have this opportunity, however knowing Gilbert in this way makes this story all that more amazing."},{"Title":"This Voice in My Heart: A Genocide Survivor's Story of Escape, Faith, and Forgiveness","review":"\\"In a world desperate for love to conquer the hatred, peace to counter the strife, and joy to carry us out of the despair - God sent Gilbert Tuhabonye. Pain and suffering heaped upon Gilbert during the genocide in Burundi did not embitter him. Quite the opposite.

I am in awe of his spirit and his ability to move beyond the atrocities of the genocidal attack to become an inspiration to others.This book is also an eye opener and a reminder to learn about and fight the inexcusable pain inflicted on so many people worldwide. I am 30, approximately the same age as Gilbert, and the book highlighted for me that, at the same time Gilbert was fleeing the wrath of his tormentors, I was sitting in an American school, woefully uneducated about the genocide taking place.Read this book; spread the word."},{"Title":"This Voice in My Heart: A Genocide Survivor's Story of Escape, Faith, and Forgiveness","review":"I'm in awe of Gilbert after training with him and even more so after learning about his life.

He does not describe himself in any sort of falsely heroic way, but neither as a victim.

I loved hearing Gilbert's descriptions of his beautiful childhood home and how simple and happy life could be; then my heart would race reading about the massacre and Gilbert's flight to escape. There were cheers during his races and tears for the lives of friends & family he had lost. Gilbert defines strength- mentally, physically, and spiritually. But what I found to be the most poignant was the amount of forgiveness this man has. I thought that if he could forgive these atrocities, then I should be able to forgive anything in my life, as well. Very simply he asserts that someone has to stop fighting, why not begin with him. I have also followed some of Gilbert's life after this book and it is obvious that forgiveness will set you free. He is an amazing man with a great heart and deserves all the best.

William was a key player in the famous California Bear Flag Revolt of June/July 1846. This book is one version of Simeon's publications.In the 1880s, Simeon was asked to prepare a biography of his brother and he did so. During the course of his efforts, he located a letter from William to California Legislator Wambough about the Bear Flag Revolt events and Simeon was able to incorporate this letter into his works. This was significant since William died an untimely death in 1852. Simeon's biographies of his brother along with the Fred B.

The book became made for TV writing, with all the stuff, funny dialoge and serious plot. Mr. Quinonez has talent, but he's giving it to Hollywood. If you like pop film, you may love this book.

PALANTE PANA!"},{"Title":"Bodega Dreams: A Novel","review":"I'm currently reading this in my 9th grade English honors class and I have to say that I find it hard to take seriously. The language seems a bit stereotypical, I don't believe everyone in Spanish Harlem speaks this way. Also, it seems as if the only point in the entire novel was to preach about how Puerto Rican-Americans don't have opportunities.I'd like to make a point, that yes; people are racist. Yes, it is hard, but it's not just hard for Latinos. It's hard for every ethnicity, because guess what? It's must be hard to believe for the author and his followers, but not every Caucasian person is born with a high IQ, ambition, wealth and a charismatic personality. Everyone has to work equally as hard in their studies and the novel made it seem as if Latinos are the only one in this entire country who have a tough time.The flashbacks show Chino whining about how he never learned about Latino history or poets. Thus, him and his friends lost interest in school because they didn't think they had a culture. Obviously, if you're complaining that everything's about Italy, Italy, Italy. You know that you have a culture that does not include Italy. Thus, contradicting himself, and makes it seem as if Spanish Harlem is devoid of a public library. Where if he was truly motivated he could've gone, read, absorbed and tried to incorporate it into lessons. It's hard to believe reading the novel, but things do not change by sitting down and whining about the system. How unfair the system is, boo hoo, it sucks for you. Guess what, it sucks for everyone else too.Also, he makes it seem as if it's up to the teachers to motivate their students to learn. When, in reality, it's not because a student should be motivated to learn for the sake of learning. If it's dependent on the teacher, there really is no substantial reason to go to school. A student could have an excellent, understanding teacher and still feel like not doing their homework. Why? Laziness, lack of ambition and maybe downright stupidity.The characters seemed extremely cliche at times with all the \\"yos\\" and \\"bros\\". Also, the stereotyping of Caucasion people throughout the novel was irritating. I, myself am part Chinese, English and Spaniard. So my views are not irked by personal offense. The characters constantly complain about white people stereotyping them, looking down on them. Yet it doesn't seem as if they're too open-minded themselves. In reality, they're no better than the people they don't know, but hate.Comparing this novel with \\"THE GREAT GATSBY\\" is basically disgusting, vile and to me an absolute farce. The reviewer who said this is either completely effected by personal views (being Latino) or hasn't actually read \\"THE GREAT GATSBY\\". Or they haven't read any other of F. Scott Fitzgerald's work. If they did, they would know that he's one of the greatest American writers of all time, with beautiful prose and unbelievable character depth. To compare the two is a complete insult to Fitzgerald because Quinonez simply doesn't measure up."},{"Title":"Bodega Dreams: A Novel","review":"It arrived right on time. Thank you so much!

One of the projects in my Latin American Studies class at my High School in MA was to pick an outside reading book and review it. Thats why I'm here! The book which deals with the life in Spanish Harlem New York, gives an awesome insight on the lives in this area. Although it has been said that the beginning was too long and uneventful, I think it was neccessary. We needed to learn about Sapo's and Chino's childhood to understand their ways as adults. The book shows that the way a child in brought up can deffinately have an affect on how they live and make decisions as adults. Seeing how Sapo stayed with the \\"gangster\\" lifestyle and how Chino gave into the the ease of \\"crime\\" was kind of sad. But then again, had Chino turned down Bodega's offer, there would be no book! I think the content was raw and really didn't hold back in trying to describe some of the situations that happened throughout the book. Other than the obvious stereotypes that the book does hold, I think the writing was awesome and would strongly recommend it to the older audience as an informative yet interesting work of fiction about a modern world."},{"Title":"Bodega Dreams: A Novel","review":"I had to read this book for a Latin American Studies assignment. Overall I liked the book. I wasn't to happy with the begining because it kinda drags on and isn't that exciting, however towards the middle the book begun to interest me more. The book takes place in Spanish Harlem. The main characters are Sapo, Chino and Willie Bodega. These guys are very close friends. They always have eachothers backs. Sapo thought he was the best. He thought he was better than everyone else and he showed it too. Bodega was basically is the guy to go to if you need anything but this is only because of the money he gets from drugs. Chino was the most street smart out of all the boys. He was the one that knew how far to go and when to get out. The book is somewhat hard to believe because it has ALOT of stereotypes in it and sometimes seems surreal."},{"Title":"Bodega Dreams: A Novel","review":"I thought Bodega Dreams was a good book. It makes you see how things are in East Harlem. It opens your eyes to things most people have never seen. One of the main points in the book is that Bodega (a drug lord) buys property then turns it in to nice apartments so that he can rent them out for cheap to his own people, so that they in turn will help him out. This has been Bodega's long time dream. Hince the name Bodega Dreams. I could go on but i dont want to ruin it for you, but all in all it was a very good book.

Just like Eminem samples other bands' music or P. Diddy did as Puff Daddy. What Quinonez did was take that sampling into literature. Don't think that F.

In fact both books start talking about the house they live in and about their &quot;neighbor&quot;.

It just is, and it doesn't deserve the praise which is heaped on it. The plot has been ripped straight from the Great Gatsby - so directly, that it becomes embarassing. Quinonez' characters seem contrived (e.g. the yin-yang sisters 'Blanca' and 'Negra'). Bodega Dreams is desperate to shock you with poverty - style here is referencing ... syringes. It feels preachy and smarmy.The book never stops to reflect on anything - you just cruise from phone call to fight, never knowing why you're there. Psychological insight is minimal - these are characters yanked around by their author - why they do, what they do, what it does to them, is never fully explained. The major problem is the looming shadow of Jay Gatsby. Willie Bodega IS Gatsby, yet somehow, he is supposed to be different. Somehow.Quinonez' prose is unremarkable, and his dialogue is patronising and irritating. At the end of the book, it is hard to put a finger on what exactly it was about. The final twist undermines everything that preceeded it, and not in a good way.Quinonez does pull some brilliant phrases out of his novel, but I never got the feeling he knew when he was doing it. I got given this book from a friend of mine who is normally very sharp - but this is a slim novel definitely less than the sum of its mostly borrowed parts."},{"Title":"Bodega Dreams: A Novel","review":"What else is there to say, other than Bodega Dreams is now an American Classic. I teach at a community college in the east coast and have included Bodega Dreams in every course and all my students don't just love it, many are changed by it. The novel is great to teach because it starts arguments in class from page one. I have spoken with many teachers in both high school and college and all say the same thing, that this book gets students reading and discussing issues. In a time when novels are so self absorbed, I was glad to find one that dealt with what is real and meaningful in life. This author will one day be spoken among authors like Henry Roth, James Baldwin, Richard Wright,and Grace Paley. I hope he gets the recognition before he is not among us."},{"Title":"Bodega Dreams: A Novel","review":"I know people compare this book to the Great Gatsby and they might be right. It does have lots of similarities, but with its own twist. I really like the poetry in this book as well, I think it gave it a very nice touch. I happy to see all this Latino's writing such great stories, I have purchased Ernesto Quinonez latest book Chango's fire and I can't wait to read it.I also purchased a couple of bodega dreams books a couple years ago as Christmas gift to friends of mine and they loved it. You don't have to be Latino to like these books. Anyone can enjoy them."},{"Title":"Bodega Dreams: A Novel","review":"This was the best book I read all year. I had read Tuff by Paul Beatty and I did like it someone told me to pick up Bodega Dreams because it was also about Spanish Harlem. Now, this book was the real thing, not well told second hand stories like TUFF. Bodega Dreams was the real deal. Quinonez knows Spanish Harlem. Like James Baldwin you could feel the love for his people and the church scenes were so well done. I look forward to reading more of Quinonez' books."},{"Title":"Bodega Dreams: A Novel","review":"I loved the first few pages of this book, and then the dude changed gears and took another road that I didn't enjoy.

If you like pop film, you may love this book. eiisa@nethere.com"},{"Title":"Bodega Dreams: A Novel","review":"I really wanted to love this book. Really. But too many cliches and an anticipating-the-movie-deal ending betray this vibrant debut from Quinonez. At times, the prose flows smoothly and realistically and you can feel the grit and intensity of life in Spanish Harlem. Other times, the cliches are simply too overwhelming. A farout plot twist at the end ruins the whole thing. I look forward to his next book."},{"Title":"Bodega Dreams: A Novel","review":"As a West Coast person with no personal knowledge of Spanish Harlem or the Puerto Rican community in New York, I felt that this novel was enlightening as well as entertaining. The struggles of the protagonist are not unlike those in poor black or Mexican areas in California.The plot reminded me of stories of the rise of the Mafia in the Italian community. Who but someone raised in Spanish Harlem would take an interest in bettering the lives of its inhabitants? I thought this was a believable portrayal of the difficulty of leaving behind the friends &amp; loved ones in order to move out of such a lifestyle.Ernesto Quinonez is an extraordinarily talented writer. Perhaps the plot was a cliche, but the message was worth repeating."},{"Title":"Bodega Dreams: A Novel","review":"This book is about Spanish Harlem but its themes are universal, love, betrayal and freindship. Mr. Quinonez does great tricks with the language. His influnces are very subtle, like nameing chapters, &quot;The Fire Next Time&quot;, &quot;A Diamond As Big as The Palladium&quot;, &quot;My Growing up and All That Piri Thomas Kinda Crap&quot;. A very good read, I think Bodega Dreams will be around for a while. I will look for Mr. Quinonez' next book. To say something about the characters, there is Sapo, Willie Bodega, Blanca, and the main character Chino. Sapo is Chino's best friend, a kid that alwas liked trouble, he was also Bodega's right hand man. Willie Bodega is the like a wannabe Martin Luther King Jr. He is also the big drug lord. Blanca is the wife of Chino, is barely mentioned but she cared for Chino alot. Chino is the main character of this story, he a smart guy. At the end he realizes that all he needs is himself and his caring wife."},{"Title":"Bodega Dreams: A Novel","review":"The main character in the story in my book is Chino. How did Chino change, Chino changed alot. Since Chino had meet a friend named Sapo, Sapo was a guy that likes to get into fights with people.

But then he had met a girl named Blanco, So he change a lot for her because he liked her and he stop getting into fights and he had stop smoking as much as he did before because after they got out of high school they got married.Early in the book, first Chino did not have a lot of friends and stuff. So he had wanted to be like this kid that likes to get into fights with everybody he could. So they had became good friends they actually became best friends one day. So Chino got his name buy fighting with people.After high school he did not like to get into fights because he was married. Blanco did not even like Sapo so he had change a lot for her. He went to school be something but I forgot what it is. But he was still friends with Sapo.

KEEP YOUR DREAMS ALIVE MY PEOPLE..PEACE JAVIER VILLEGAS"},{"Title":"Bodega Dreams: A Novel","review":"After reading the reviews in the NY Times, online, and elsewhere, Bodega Dreams sounded as if it would be an exceptional read. It was not. To say the least, it falls far short of the hype. To compare it to Gatsby is like comparing the NY Yankees to the Toledo Mudhens. Quinones shows skill as a writer only when he is describing Spanish Harlem. His passages about nicknames and his description of a Pentecostal Church are especially on the mark. But the rest of the book simply sags. The plot is flimsy, the writing sometimes sounds amateurish (who edited this?), and the ending is almost laughable (although it is intended to be anything but). Ernesto, I think you've got talent, but stick to what you know, and stay away from the sensational."},{"Title":"Bodega Dreams: A Novel","review":"I hoped this book would be good; Quinones has received a lot of acclaim for it. Unfortunately, this book is bad. Instead of subtlely or finely discussing the oppression, racism, and harsh reality his characters faced, Quinones preaches and divulges information in a totally unbeleivable way. There are the occasional well crafted phrases and sections, but they are drowned out by the horribly cliche plot and unbeleivable story line. I'm sure the numerous references to Spanish Harlem will ring true for those from that area, for me though, they didn't add much. Instead of just mentioning &quot;la marqueta&quot;, why not reveal the nature of it? Reference after reference seemed to have only one purpose, &quot;name dropping&quot;. As such, it grew tiresome. Notwithstanding the fact that my review is negative, I appreciate the fact that people are writing stories from the urban Latino perspective; I just think we can do better."},{"Title":"Bodega Dreams: A Novel","review":"................. The writer is clearly capable of terrific evocative writing, his Spanish Harlem is right on the mark, but the plot and dialogue are at times downright embarrassing and cliche ridden. I would have preferred a book with no plot or talking at all."},{"Title":"Bodega Dreams: A Novel","review":"I enjoyed the book, &quot;Bodega Dreams&quot;. It was a really good book. I didn't get to read the whole book, but I enjoyed it. So far, about the book, I know that the setting takes place in East Harlem. Some of the characters are Blanca, Sapo, Willie Bodega, and the main character, Chino. Willie Bodega is one of the biggest druglord of East Harlem. Sapo is Bodega's &quot;right hand man&quot;. Sapo is also Chino's best friend. Chino is the main character. He is a very smart man. His wife, Blanca, is pregnant. Meanwhile Chino is trying to complete his time in college. At one point, he does a favor for Willie Bodega, only he thinks the favor was for Sapo. After the favor was done, Chino, not knowing Bodega, was visited by Sapo, Sapo saying that Bodega wanted to speak to him. Chino finally met Bodega. That's when Bodega started trying to make offers with Chino to make Chino one of his &quot;panas&quot;, friends."},{"Title":"Bodega Dreams: A Novel","review":"I hate this novel, superficial, misleading and full of despair. Noir in the worst taste. The hero never realizes that once you dishonor yourself you have hurt yourself and your community. The reparations are not to set up detox clinics while still selling drugs. The hero &quot;takes down&quot; the lawer and the cunning Vera but he does it because they killed Willie Bodega, a &quot;nice&quot; organized crime hancho, from whom the hero had gotten favors. The hero, a college student speaks spanglish ghetto ebonics, hmmm. All the time. There is that marvelous twist toward the end but the reader has no hint at it, it just comes out of the blue."},{"Title":"Bodega Dreams: A Novel","review":"While Quinonez deserves props for articulating a vision of Spanish Harlem (and for selling a first novel about it!), he has simply taken every element of 'The Great Gatsby', from plot to use of narrator, to the ending. This, I'm sorry to say, is not original writing. I'm amazed it was published. For an authentic, original take on this subject, I recommend 'Always Running', about the LA barrio. But if you liked this book, perhaps you'll love Quinonez' next novel: it's a tale of a Puerto Rican prince who can't decide whether or not to kill his uncle, who murdered his father."},{"Title":"Bodega Dreams: A Novel","review":"I was really looking forward to reading something different, something authentic and real, and all of the buzz suggested this was it.

This book was written from the heart and takes you on a guided tour of Spanish Harlem and the people who make up this culturally diverse melting pot in NYC. The characters are both interesting and funny. Ernesto has a great sense of humor and some of his characters quirks will have you laughing out loud.

With terrible outcomes expected and certain individuals suspected, I was constantly worried about these characters. Sapo is a scary guy, but absolutely hilarious. Neno was obviously a lot of fun for Quinonez to write and was a blast to read. I'm not going to give anything about my opinion of the story and the finale, because I'm afraid it would give too much away. Excellent debut!!One problem with audio books is that I wonder if I would have gotten as much out of the story without the superb narration of Robert Ramirez. He is fantastic. He brings the characters to life and really makes you feel them. I'll be looking for every other book he has narrated.

I chose this book out of a list of books given to me by my English teacher. We discussed and summarized the events of the book within our assigned groups. I gave it 4 stars, because it sometimes felt like I was reading a soap opera. However I enjoyed reading it for the most part and I'm glad I chose Bodega Dreams opposed to another option."},{"Title":"Bodega Dreams: A Novel","review":"Ernesto Quinonez' debut novel, Bodega Dreams, breaks through stereotypes, and enlightens the reader to the numerous human elements that make up El Barrio. Nevertheless, his purpose is not to explain the socio-economic group dynamic that makes up contempoary East Harlem. His purpose is to tell a good story. Unfortunately, I was expecting more of the former. As an Anglo who works in a Hispanic community, I thought the book would give me more insight into how Nuyoricans view themselves within New York's Latin American Community. For instance, the reality of inter-Hispanic relations is more complex than the author lets on. Although the subject is broached (inside the precinct house), Quinonez leaves it at it's barely scratched surface.Although these expectations were not satisfied, my curiosity as a reader of a good novel was. Quinonez' hero, Chico, doesn't take a holier than thou attitude toward the seedier characters he meets, but accepts them for who they are: hoods, drug dealers, mafiosos, and the lowlife attorney, Navarro.The descriptions of El Barrio are first rate. The reader gets an insider's view of Quinonez' home turf: the sights, sounds and smells that make up his neighborhood. What the author fails to do is explain why Chino's love, Blanca, a devout Pentecostal, falls in love with him and gets married at such a young age, despite his continued association with the local drug pusher, Sapo. Perhaps the courtship was edited out of the original manuscript. And although Chino seems to be a decent, inteligent fellow, how these two became married while full time college students is never satisfactorily answered. The plot was interesting, pitting the black and white concepts of right and wrong against the myriad grays that represent the realities of survival and prosperity in El Barrio. The characters of Chino and Sapo were well developed, but the lesser characters were one-sided. The social conscience of Willie Bodega, the Puerto Rican Social Activist turned drug dealer, was quite unbelievable. The dialogue was interesting, and often humorous, but oftentimes highly predictable. However, the climax was somewhat surprising, and did catch me off guard. All told, I found this to be excellent debut novel, and look forward to Quinonez' next book."},{"Title":"Bodega Dreams: A Novel","review":"Bodega Dreams brought back alot of memories of growing up in Spanish Harlem (Carver Projects) during the 70's and 80's. Each time I read something that would trigger a memory, I would read the section to my husband (a wonderful &quot;redneck&quot;) and tell him that's how it was while I was growing up. The men playing dominoes outside, the congos being played on the streets, the pumps opened on a hot summer night, the salsa coming from the apartment windows...all of it brings back memories. I moved away in 1984 and moved around the country. I now call a small quiet town in Ohio home, but my family is still there. My mother still lives in the same apartment that I grew up in. I don't go back often but the memories in the book were sweet. Ernesto has captured the feel and emotions of the spanish people in harlem. For all you latinos out there, read this book...you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Bodega Dreams: A Novel","review":"Bodega Dreams is a shiny penny in the middle of nothingness. Vivid characters and fresh dialogue. Ernesto Quinonez has succeeded in accomplishing a novel that spills out sad and beautiful truths without worrying about who its spilled on. This book is reminiscent of authors such as Piri Thomas, Junot Diaz and Abraham Rodriguez Jr. but Mr. Quinonez is still able to carve his own niche into the land of Latino Literature."},{"Title":"Bodega Dreams: A Novel","review":"Here is the novel Junot Diaz would have loved to have written. But I don't think Quinonez should be compared to anyone. He is a very authentic voice. This is a beautiful and heartbreaking book. The language is so fast you'd think you're on a subway going uptown, and so humorous, you're entertained throughout the voyage. I highly recommend this novel! (And cheap paperback too--so give them to your friends!)"},{"Title":"Bodega Dreams: A Novel","review":"I just finished one of the best and most important books I have read in years, Ernesto Quinones' Bodega Dreams. Bodega Dreams is an entire universe, vividly written. Quinones has a great ear for voices. The characters are more real, with their dialogues, than some of the people you spoke to today. This is one of those rare books that is funny, sad, inspiring, and alive, a book which rings in places like a bell, rings with the absolute, humming truth that makes a classic.The real fix, the real hit in reading is when you see your own experience of the world reflected, when you nod your head in agreement, laugh with recognition. A great book can be confirmation that you exist, that your world is important. Nothing is more crippling to the soul than erasure, and a great book about the world you recognize is the opposite of erasure.That's why reading Bodega Dreams is POWERFUL. I'm an americana, but I work in a barrio, and all day long I listen to the voices and stories that come out of it. The voices are beautiful, sad, funny, interesting, alive and so damn VALUABLE. The lives of my clients, which make up the life of the barrio, are full of injustice, and and courage. My clients speak with a language (Spanglish or nuevorican) of their own. The barrio is a huge slice of the America I know, of the life that I live (at least vicariously). The disorientation I sometimes feel when I leave my particular barrio and enter the mainstream media world - a world which erases and denies the barrio and it's language - is unsettling. Sometimes it makes me very angry, as though someone had suddenly slapped the people I talk to all day and told them to shut up. As though they'd been gagged (or maybe I should say gagged again, because it often seems to me that their dealings with the mainstream are an endless series of gaggings, interruptions, and disrespect). Well, Ernesto Quinones's book rips the gag off.One of the key characters in Bodega dreams is a former political activist, William Irizarry aka Willie Bodega. After the activism of the seventies failed, and after some personal betrayals, Willie Bodega became a junkie, and then got clean and became the East Harlem version of a mafia don. Except Bodega is a don with a difference. His dream is to spend dirty money renovating, building, educating - empowering, in fact - the people of the ghetto.The protaginist, Julio, has to negotiate between his love for his evangelica wife, who needless to say, is a real straight arrow, and his loyalty to, and growing involvement with, Willie Bodega. There are also fascinating subplots, character sketches worthy of Dickens, and colored glimpses of puerto rican city life.Trust me, on the most superficial level, Bodega Dreams is a fast ride and great reading, even if you haven't the slightest interest in Spanish Harlem or la cultura puerto riquena. But on other levels the book is revolutionary. This is a DANGEROUS book - as George Orwell's books and Charles Dicken's books were dangerous - because it speaks for and to people who have been silenced.Ernesto Quinones, thank you. You are my hero, my Willie Bodega."},{"Title":"Bodega Dreams: A Novel","review":"I bought this book in a used bookstore on a lark.Boy, was I happy I did when I finished it.The book is written really well, with a confident tone that belies this is a debut novel. There's a tremendous amount of detail about Spanish Harlem and its people. I found this quite authentic and compelling and it made me want to read more by him.The central character, Chino, is a latter day Oliver Twist falling under the spell of a far craftier Fagan-like character. I found the villain, Willie Bodega, to be a compelling character as well with real motivations and troubles. Deception follows deception and soon no one can stop the chain of events unleashed by passion, greed, and love.The author teaches school in New York. He's well educated and well versed in literature. It's really quite a treat to see him take certain classic elements of a tale and lay them down in Spanish Harlem. At times I felt I was reading a modern day update of a Grecian tragedy. At other times I felt like I was reading a Spanish Oliver Twist.At every point, I was enthralled. I recommend Ernesto Quinonez's Bodega Dreams highly."},{"Title":"Bodega Dreams: A Novel","review":"I purchased this book in error, but it was a great mistake. I thought it was going to be about the Mexican immigrants who work at the Korean bodegas in Manhattan. Wow, was i wrong. Instead I found a lyrical novel with a social vision about Chino (Julio Mercado), who finds that you just can't do one favor for Willy Bodega, East Harlem's chief drug dealer and philanthropist. I live just a few blocks from the epicenter of the story, but it was a completely different world that the novel introduced to me. Just as Claude Brown created Harlem for readers of &quot;Manchild&quot;, Quinonez, 34, a New York City 4th grade bilingual school teacher of Ecuadorian and Puerto Rican ancestry, raised by a Communist father and Jehovah Witness mother, paints for the reader a portrait of El Barrio, a Spanish Harlem of apartment blocks, bodegas, botanicas, beans, holdups, murals, nicknames, rice, BMW's, and communions. Yes, you get drawn in with all the nicknames, like Chino, and Sapo, Blanca, Taino, Batuka, Bisocho, as well as Papito, Tato, and Junito, but you stay for the mystery of the story of the criminality of some of the characters. Will Chino become a front for the Harry Goldstein Real Estate Agency (which is actually a front for Bodega's empire)? Can you do a single favor and wipe your hands of the relationship? Can you escape Taino Towers? Is it true that while the Messiah tarries, and the goodpeople are only good for paying loans, that only the dishonest and paradoxical people can bring about change? Eso esta heavy duty!"},{"Title":"Bodega Dreams: A Novel","review":"As an avid reader I'm always on the quest for new books. After reading an excerpt of Bodega Dreams I was hooked. The language was great, it is a language I often speak myself, Spanglish. Growing up in a not so nice neighborhood in Long Island, NY I found the book comforting becuase it hit close to home. I loved the characters, especially Sapo. The story is one that goes on in all walks of life, deceit. I hope that Ernesto Quinonez finds the inspiration to write a second book to let his readers know if Blanca &amp; Chino stay together. Until then I will spread the word of his first great novel and wait for a second."},{"Title":"Bodega Dreams: A Novel","review":"Ernesto Quinonez's first novel, Bodega Dreams, is a modern update on the Great Gatsby formula, set in Spanish Harlem. Quinonez has an original and authentic writing voice-particularly when it comes to establishing setting, character and mood- but the dialog is often a step behind-a few too many clich&eacute;s, language a little to refined for a ghetto setting. Nonetheless, his sense of timing is good, his characters are memorable and the story is deftly executed. This is an author who shows great promise. I'm looking forward to his sophomore effort."},{"Title":"Bodega Dreams: A Novel","review":"I enjoyed the book very much as a fan of &quot;The Great Gatsby.&quot; Quinonez is a great addition to our Latino literary culture along with Piri Thomas and Junot Diaz.

I'll lok forward to Ernesto's next book."},{"Title":"Bodega Dreams: A Novel","review":"This book Rocks!

Ernesto don't know you bro, but this book is sound.The sun shines for you my cool brother."},{"Title":"Bodega Dreams: A Novel","review":"This book is about Spanish Harlem but its themes are universal, love, betrayal and freindship. Mr. Quinonez does great tricks with the language. His influnces are very subtle, like nameing chapters, &quot;The Fire Next Time&quot; (Baldwin), &quot;A Diamond As Big as The Palladium&quot; (Fitzgerald), &quot;My Growing up and All That Piri Thomas Kinda Crap&quot; (Salinger and Piri Thomas. A very good read, I think Bodega Dreams will be around for a while. I will look for Mr. Quinonez' next book."},{"Title":"Bodega Dreams: A Novel","review":"A poor but idealistic young man falls in love with an upwardly mobile lady who dumps him because of his poverty and marries a wealthy man. He vows to amass a fortune to win her back. Years later, now a millionaire because of illegal narcotic smuggling, he reappears to throw lavish parties and win her back. She leaves her husband only to kill a man and her now rich boyfriend agrees to take the blame. And all of this is narrated by a decent young man who slowly comes to realize the true and unrealistic vision of the boyfriend. Does this sound like Fitzgerald's THE GREAT GATSBY? Ernesto Quinonez in BODEGA DREAMS updates Gatsby's tale of unreality colliding with harsh reality to serve as the backdrop for Spanish Harlem. Now there is nothing wrong with borrowing plot elements from other and more successful books, but what should stamp the updated version is a sense that the author has enlarged on the themes of the original and staked out new literary territory of its own. Unfortunately, Quinonez does little more than give his characters Hispanic names and verbal tics. Much of his book is full of the phonetic pronunciation of Hispanicized English with frequent obscenities thrown in.What emerges from BODEGA DREAMS are the same themes that Fitzgerald handled with far more skill in THE GREAT GATSBY. Willie Bodega (Gatsby) has loved Vera (Daisy) for years and plans to win her back by amassing a fortune in crime. Bodega might have been a decent man except for his blind spot of love for Vera that dragged him into a life of crime. Julio (Nick) sees Bodega as a man with a vision that allows him to reshape reality so that the end product will be about as real as his love for her. Bodega associates his vision of a renovated Spanish Harlem with a renovated love for a woman who refuses to be seen only as a two dimensional matrix. If Bodega can only construct a mansion fitting enough for a Spanish king, then surely Vera will see the worth that burns in his soul.Much of the better parts of Bodega Dreams explores the gap between wish fullfillment and brute reality. Bodega's dreams are infectious. Nearly everyone who knows him is taken in by those dreams and does not mind that crime may be the impetus behind some serious social and romantic re-engineering. But not everyone is taken in by those dreams. The tragedy of any dream is not only that dreams have a bitter habit of being crushed by reality, but rather that not everyone shares that dream. Some, in fact, have competing dreams that force the original dreamer to see that any foundation built only on illusion is no foundation at all. Fitzgerald's Gatsby never got to see that. For that matter, neither did Quinonez's Bodega."},{"Title":"Bodega Dreams: A Novel","review":"This book is too heavy handed in its political message to be taken seriously. Quinonez obviously wrote Bodega Dreams with the aim to broker a movie deal. The characters are uninteresting which is really amazing because there is so much potential for great dialogue and suspense. Quinonez's weak writing style is magnified by his insistence to endlessly spell everything out for the reader. Bodega Dreams offers nothing new to the discussion of the urban environment."},{"Title":"Bodega Dreams: A Novel","review":"i feel that the book was fresh and easy to relate to. the language was real and bodega was an incredible character. however, chino, is the character that is easiest to relate to, because of the conflicts he faces when choosing right vs. wrong decisions. the book shows how life is in the hood and how latinos must work as both a unity and as individuals to improve the situations within el barrio and other latino communities."},{"Title":"Bodega Dreams: A Novel","review":"Bodega Dreams is a contemporary fiction novel that could easily be interpreted as reality. The author uses vivid realistic descriptions and immediately enthralls the reader with a set up comparable to a soap opera. First the reader is introduced to Chino, the hardworking honest kid trying to get out of East Harlem the right way. With Chino comes Blanca, his strict Pentecostal wife. Constantly emerging between the two is Chino's childhood friend, Sapo. Sapo is also going places, yet much to Blanca's dismay, uses a different, not so honest approach. Sapo leads Chino to Bodega, the man that runs it all and that will change Chino's life and the lives of many others. Occasionally, the author incorporates explicit actions and vocabulary into the plotline. This functions simply to secure the reality of the scenes and invoke a sense of realism in the reader. Lack of such vivid details would only cheapen the novel. I say, don't let a few bad words scare you away! I eagerly recommend this book to any individual looking for a quick, interesting, educational and inspiring read. However, don't start the book if you are short of time, I'm afraid it won't be easy to put down!"},{"Title":"Bodega Dreams: A Novel","review":"I am a student a Walla Walla High School and rate Bodega Dreams a 5 star. Bodega Dreams shows all the action, drugs, drama and basically all you could ask for in a gangster fantasy. I think that this book really has character and shows how a Latino has a dream of turning Spanish Harlem into an empire, how he wants his people out of poverty and into the high life of wealthy Americans. Bodega Dreams also shows how a Latin American kid grows up in N.Y. and has to crawl his way through finacial problems and face racist teachers at school, how he has to stay on his side of the hood or else Italians would put you on check. I think that anyone that like these kinds of book should read it because its a real page turner and keeps you biting your nails to see what happens next. I think that Ernesto Quinonez did a fabulous job in writing this book and it also teaches you how to reach your goals and DREAM!"},{"Title":"Bodega Dreams: A Novel","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It was a story that was set in a place that hardly ever gets heard from. As a non-Spanish speaker, I was a little put out by the use of Spanish and not knowing what they were saying. The end provided a twist that I didn't expect. Good, quick, read."},{"Title":"Bodega Dreams: A Novel","review":"Nothing bad to say about this book...I thought it was kind of stupid at first, like it was going to be one of those ghetto - superstar glamorizations that the media enjoys exploiting.However, halfway through the book, the story became decent and the storyline picked up, and the character Chino's realizations of his wrongdoings refreshed the dulling, cliche plot. It was at this point, when he starts trying to make a difference, that you realize this book isn't like all the rest of them.Cool, eh? Read it. :)"},{"Title":"Bodega Dreams: A Novel","review":"A good read, the author has much potential."},{"Title":"Bodega Dreams: A Novel","review":"Someone I usually recommend books to thought I had recommended this to him, so when I saw it in the bookstore, I decided to give it a try, and boy was it worth it!&quot;Chino&quot; Julio Mercado is a smart young man, trying to get ahead by getting an education and planning a future with his wife and soon-to-be-born child: buy a house, have a decent life. But his life will never be the same once he hears the name &quot;Willie Bodega&quot;. Bodega has dreams for a future, a decent life, but he has other kinds of plans: using drug money instead of &quot;conventional&quot; methods in order to build his empire. Bodega has dreams, of happiness with the woman he loves, even if she belongs to someone else. He dreams that he is powerful, that he is adored, that he will somehow live forever.Chino doesn't want to cross the line; he believes in honesty and integrity, but these are eroded slowly, so slowly that he doesn't realize it's happening until it's too late. In the end, he realizes that once you touch fire, you can't help but be burned. And some burns never really heal.This is a wonderful book, and I'm looking forward to Mr. Qui&ntilde;onez' next endeavor."},{"Title":"Bodega Dreams: A Novel","review":"I enjoyed reading Bodega Dreams because Qui&ntilde;onez does such a fine job of keeping the plot moving. The story itself is stylized, but I do not find that to be a drawback in a novel; on the contrary, most of the most enjoyable novels I have read have required a willing suspension of disbelief.Qui&ntilde;onez does an admirable job of creating characters that the reader comes to know and care about, and the first-person narrative from the main character's viewpoint are dead on. However, some of the peripheral characters are not as well drawn. I would, for example, have appreciated some more development of Blanca's mother.Bodega Dreams was interesting to me primarily for two reasons. Like Mr. Qui&ntilde;onez, I am a bilingual teacher and have spent my carreer working in Hispanic communities. I was interested in the similarities and differences between the inner-city Puerto Rican community Qui&ntilde;onez describes and the Mexican-American communities where I have worked in Denver and California. And Qui&ntilde;onez is at his best as a writer when describing Spanish Harlem. Although I have never been to New York City, the similarities between the neighborhoods he describes and those where I have lived and worked became quite clear through Qui&ntilde;onez' excellent description.That Qui&ntilde;onez is writing about what he knows is obvious when we consider this descriptive accuracy. I did have to consider how much his own opinions enter into his social commentary, however; I have a little trouble with the main character's bland acceptance of a drug dealer as saviour of a neighborhood. While the character Willie Bodega's rationalization of his plan sounds realistic enough coming from him, I was left feeling a little disappointed that Qui&ntilde;onez' narrator didn't question his morality more deeply.I also questioned his reminiscence into his own school experiences wherein he described the &quot;Anglo&quot; teachers as almost exclusively malevolent, and the Hispanic teachers as universally sympathetic to &quot;La Raza&quot;. While this may have been the narrator's experience - or, at least, his perception of it - I was left questioning what the author himself really thinks. A scene in which an Hispanic teacher tells a violent student to lie to avoid expulsion after a vicious attack on an Anglo teacher made me particularly uncomfortable.Despite its flaws, I found this to be a thoroughly well-written novel, and I recommend it. I enjoyed reading the other reviews on this site and would love to discuss the book with my friends - whether they agree with my own assessment or not."},{"Title":"Bodega Dreams: A Novel","review":"The hype surrounding this young writer and this book has been hyperbolic, no doubt. But it's not too far from what could be coming from this exciting writer.Comparisons to Junot Diaz are weak--unfortunately born out of the lack of knowledge pertaining to Hispanic writers. Quinonez's style is that of agitated motion. In this sense, he captures the pace of NYC's ghetto life well. The noises, smells, colors, and taste of East Harlem are well-detailed, while not falling into Tom Wolffe-like pretensions. In trying to capture the language of the streets, Quinonez surprisingly misses it. As a product of el barrio, and still teaching and residing in the heart of NYC, his usage of &quot;slanguage&quot; falls short. If you're going to try to capture the speaking of the streets, don't put &quot;g&quot;s where they're not being pronounced and such.The story itself, a rough redoing of The Great Gatsby, is somewhat hard to fathom, but the fantasy helps let the story build well, and it's easy to keep going with it. You really do want to know what happens at the end. The idealistic overtones are just that, idealistic, but that shouldn't be criticized. A drug dealer turning Kennedy-esque and saving his people is not all that far-fetched when you think about it. And to prove this, Quinonez does a marvelous job of using real-life examples of the Young Lords--a true &quot;gang&quot; that was about the betterment of a community. It's this base that Willie Bodega is a product of, fictionally, but this piece of history combined with the essence of East Harlem and Spanish culture in general produces solid results in the end.Stop the Junot comparisons. It's unfair to Junot Diaz, and soon enough, will unfair to Ernesto Quinonez."},{"Title":"Bodega Dreams: A Novel","review":"i feel that the book was fresh and easy to relate to. the language was real and bodega was an incredible character. however, chino, is the character that is easiest to relate to, because of the conflicts he faces when choosing right vs. wrong decisions. the book shows how life is in the hood and how latinos must work as both a unity and as individuals to improve the situations withing el barrio."},{"Title":"Bodega Dreams: A Novel","review":"After pulling the reader instantly into its other-world-next-door setting, Bodega Dreams becomes a quick, harrowing ride through a dangerous, enlightening period in the life of a very engaging narrator.

The outrageous novel Bodega Dreams by Ernesto Quinonez is about latin people (Puerto Ricans) living in Spanish Harlem and their experiences. It focuses on how one man trys to help the residents out in exchange for loyalty. Julio Mercado also known as Chino helps Bodega and his partner Nazario.I loved the way Quinonez used street-smart dialogue. The way the characters talk to eachother in the book, seems like you are hearing them on the street talking in real life. He uses all the curses and slang very realistically.I recomend this book to guys who are 16 and older because many young men are getting themselves into drugs and businesses with the wrong people. Most of them are hispanics. This book would probably have them guessing what will happen next."},{"Title":"Bodega Dreams: A Novel","review":"This is the best book with a social conscience written about Latinos.

Although some parts of the book are more fillers and don't really have much to do with the plot, I liked how the chain of events eventually led to a surprise ending that reveals characters' true motives, as well as secret betrayals. While action didn't play a major part in Quinonez's storytelling, the raw speech and interactions between those involved in the story created tension that builds throughout the novel. This was a pretty quick and decent read."},{"Title":"Bodega Dreams: A Novel","review":"Harsh language and violence. This may be how someone would describe the book Bodega Dreams if they had failed to get over the potentially offensive material meant to create a mood and background and ignored the true message featured in the book. Bodega Dreams is not about selling drugs, street alliances, or even life in Spanish Harlem. It's about dreams, the true American dream, to live in comfort and happiness, no matter where one happens to live in this nation.Set in the heart of Spanish Harlem during the eighties, the story stars Chino, a young man trying to make his way in the neighborhood without involvement in illegal street gangs. Alongside Chino are his Pentecostal wife, Blanca, and his childhood friend Sapo. Sapo is involved in drug dealings in el Barrio, through which he meets Willie Bodega, the neighborhood's major drug lord with big plans and dreams. One evening, at Bodega's request, Sapo brings Chino to an apartment where Bodega invites him to be apart of Bodega's plans to improve the neighborhood. From that point drama surrounding Bodega and all his activities unfolds as chino is taken on a wild ride through underground Spanish Harlem.The novel, although fairly simple and one dimensional, proves for extremely enjoyable reading with unpredictable twists and turns. Peppered thorough out the story are enhancing Spanish and profane words, giving the book a sense of validity that would have been lost without use of such words. Overall, I thought the book to be very interesting with an ending so unseen, I was put into shock.

On one hand, the storyis a completely engaging account of life in Spanish Harlem, butit goes beyond that by giving us characters that embodyconflicts we all go through, to one extent or another.It questions the acceptability of risk and compromise in creating a better future, on both personal and social levels.The characters are simply and powerfully rendered: I felt likeI had just had a long and engaging conversation with Chino(the main character) after finishing the book.Part of me is curious to find out what he's beenup to since the book ended (a feeling I love coming away froma book with).This book is a great example of the valor that lies inavoiding heavy-handed prose, and opting instead for truthand human connection.

Anyone could read this book, young or old, except for the fact that if you are offended by foul language I would not recommend reading it because it's ALL OVER the book!! Some of the language I could not understand at first, but after reading it became clearer to what they were saying.

First of all, it doesn't even take place in LA, but in Spanish Harlem, NY. And although the main characters of the book are in fact Latino, they are Puerto-Rican. The Bodega in the title is not grocery store or an empty room, but a man.I was almost immediately swept into the world of our beloved protagonist and narrator Chino. The first few pages of Bodega Dreams was great. The author already established his style and I fell in love with his vivid descriptions of upper Manhattan. I grew up in Yonkers, NY, in a similar environment and although I can not relate to the specific struggles of a young Latino, I could definitely understand the surroundings. I have been to East Harlem many times and the author's descriptions of El Barrio are first rate. I noticed this within the first chapters.A few things bothered me though. I understand the importance of providing information about the past to understand who the characters are as young adults, and although the portrayal of Sapo is awesome, I would have appreciated a better development of Blanca's character and the episodes that surrounded her and Chino eventually getting married. In the beginning of the story she is described as a Pentecostal beauty that every guy wants but can't get, but then, seemingly out of the blue, she and Chino were getting married. Also, it may be different in East Harlem, but where I grew up, unless you were black, you didn't call your friends \\"nigga\\" - it just seemed funny to me - but perhaps that is the way the youth talks in Spanish Harlem and it was meant to add to the realism of the story, which is fine with me because I'll take realism and accuracy over \\"political-correctness\\" anytime and anyplace - especially in literature! But I also noticed a lot of syntax errors, like the absence of question marks and commas when they were needed. Maybe this was the fault of the editor but never-the-less it was a little annoying.Despite little flaws like that, the Author's ability to set a mood is superb. I can picture this book becoming a movie, complete in my mind with a pre-picked cast. It has the perfect combinations of over-used cliches (which are not always a bad thing), raw dialogue, interesting characters, and a near perfect narration. I particularly liked the way Round 1 of Book 2 starts with the same few sentences as the beginning of the book, and then adds \\" - But by now you know that it was always about Bodega.\\"Qui&ntilde;onez is writing about a neighborhood he knows; this is obvious when I read the accuracy in all the descriptions. This makes me wonder about how much of his own experiences may have fallen into the pages of this book. How the narrator perceived his educational experiences made me a little uncomfortable though: describing the white teachers as arrogant and racist, and all the Hispanic teachers being so sympathetic to the tribulations of the latin youth.I also wonder how much of the author's own personal opinions entered into the commentary. Upon some research, I have discovered that the author is the son of a devout Communist. Bodega's dream itself seems to be a neo-Marxist revolution, where crime, violence, and drugs are the forces behind major social rebuilding. The author even uses real examples like \\"the Young Lords\\" to reinforce the idealism of his characters and their plans to eventually \\"free\\" Puerto Rico from the American commonwealth. Although his name isn't mentioned in the book (for obvious reasons), I wonder how much of these thoughts were inspired by an admiration of Che Gueverra.Somewhere near the middle of this book the story began to be very familiar. It was when Bodega was seeking to meet Vera that I began to feel like I was reading a modern day Spanish-Harlem version of The Great Gatsby (Gatsby and Daisy). By the end of the book my suspicions were confirmed. Bodega Dreams is, in fact, a mirror of F. Scott Fitzgerald's classic complete with a similiar twist of an ending.It is a good novel though and a grand debut attempt. I look forward to reading more from this author."},{"Title":"Bodega Dreams: A Novel","review":"This novel is very good in that it captures a lot of the flavor of the hispanic community and its struggles to get a fair share of the action. Chino is always trying to figure out where he stands in relation to making things better for himself and his family. The struggle is whether to keep on the legal path or step beyond, where action speacks louder than words. Very good read, look forward to more from Quinonez."},{"Title":"Bodega Dreams: A Novel","review":"I taught this book this past semester at a private school and now my students are not justswearing by this book but quoting it, too. They hated The Great Gatsby as much I tried explaining to themthat Fitzgerald was a genius and all respects to this author, Qui&ntilde;onez, is not. They could care less, and embracedBodega Dreams and told me they were put to sleep by The Great Gatsby. All things must change and I didn't like the bookas much as they did but will teach it again because it speak to them, I guess the way Fitzgerald once spoke to another generation."},{"Title":"Bodega Dreams: A Novel","review":"i had to read this book for my latino literature class. my teacher told us that we were going to LOVE this book and she AIN'T kidding!!! best book i have ever read so far!!! it had me kept turning the pages! i am in love with it!!! it's officially being added to my book collection. the character sapo is very funny but vulgar while chino is a good guy who just happens to get involved with the wrong kind of people. i had a great time reading about the characters and the east harlem setting. the street language hits closer to home so i wasn't bothered by it. i am so impressed with this book that i would like to delve in more of the author's other work. i hope that someday this novel will be turn into a movie. definitely recommend for people who are interested in boricua/latino literature or new york."},{"Title":"Bodega Dreams: A Novel","review":"I just finished reading this book for my English Literature class. Awesome book!!! I'm not much for reading, but this book draws you in the further you read. It's been compared many times to Great Gatsby because the main character Willy/Izzy aka Bodega comes from a low poverty latino family, in which those who recall Gatsby was not born into money either. These two characters earned their living through illegal vending of certain items and their goal or dream was to make something better of themselves in order to be accepted by people or a certain someone. Bodega dreams is about attaining and living the American dream. It takes place in a Latino American community. Bodega is known as the \\"go to man\\" when you need something. His idea and goal in life was to turn his community around, to make it better for his fellow Latinos. He did this through means of selling drugs in order to pay for college tuition, pay rent for his tenants, purchase property and house poor Latino families. The fuel that drove his passion in this direction was in hopes of winning back his first love Vera. Author Quinones is a wonderful, skilled and creative writer. This novel worked its way into familiar territories using fictional ideas of certain places in East Harlem. This made this book all the more interesting and relatable. The ending of this novel has an unexpected twist. I don't want to spoil it for anyone. I recommend this book to anyone who is looking for something new to read or for something that is a little close to home."},{"Title":"Bodega Dreams: A Novel","review":"I really enjoyed this book. For me I liked the fact that it was down-to-earth. The events that took place in the book are very comparable to everyday happenings. The fact that the book was realistic helped keep me interested in it. Although being very realistic the book was not boring. The happenings were practical but at the same time surprising. If you like to read about the Mob and organized crime then this book is for you. It focuses on Harlem and how organized crime and mobsters try to change it around for the better. It is very interesting and is hard to put down. It is also an easy book to read. I would recommend this book to teenagers and young adults. I would also let you know that the cursing in this book is outrageous. So if you don't like cursing I would stay away. Overall the book was great and I hope you enjoy it also."},{"Title":"Bodega Dreams: A Novel","review":"This book rocks, that's it. It rocks, it works in many levels.

The books listed at the end and the mail order suppliers don't include U.S. titles or suppliers, but any fabric store should have what you need or for that matter, any Walmart.The book helps you plan the size, shape, function, and type of lid for your box project.

Those who are used to reading Mishima's other works might find this book a wonderful change of pace. I thoroughly enjoyed the development of the characters and the sweet, awkward moments that occur between the two lovers in this classic tale of first love."},{"Title":"The Sound of Waves","review":"...is how, according to Nathan's biography, Mishima referred to this book on several occasions. It does seem very uncharacteristic, being a straightforward love story, showing great interest in its humble setting and without Mishima's trademark disdain for 'ordinary people,' but I think it may have been as true to his aesthetic inclinations as his darker works. It highlights the other side of the tradition which fascinated him - the life-affirming courage and old-fashioned masculine code of the samurai, as opposed to the more morbid dictate that the samurai 'must die each day in his mind.' Near the end, a character makes a remark along the lines of: 'Shinji's got guts. That's really all that matters,' and that seems to sum this book up pretty well. I think this book may have meant more to Mishima than he admitted. It's certainly accesible to those who wouldn't like his more intense stuff, and provides a spot of definite interest for fans."},{"Title":"The Sound of Waves","review":"In a time when understanding and good will seem all too hard and too fine, classic novels like this and \\"The Tale of Gengi\\", written by a lady of the court, Murasaki Shikibu, give a westerner a feel for Japan that is needed. Japan still has an Emperor and England has a Queen... their customs and traditions remain."},{"Title":"The Sound of Waves","review":"Although this story has a fairy tale-like element to it, it also has a satirical meaning. It is actually a satire on society and his opinion regarding other issues such as suicide. The island of Uta-jima is a utopian society and, of course, can't exist in real life. A delightful story and has some &quot;inappropriate&quot; scenes but is tolerable. Only love story that isn't perverted or sardonic by Mishima."},{"Title":"The Sound of Waves","review":"Obviously I am reading a translation of this book, but I love the story and I believe it is very well written!"},{"Title":"The Sound of Waves","review":"He liked it - it was okay.

The Sound of Waves doesn't have the suicides and violence of other Mishima works - something I don't miss - but it also lacks his usual depth of character study and glorious prose - that I do miss. The key characters are altogether too nice, too perfect. Shinji, the handsome, brave, self-effacing youth who never told a deliberate lie until page 156 of the book - and Hatsue, much the same, but with perfectly perky breasts. It seemed that Mishima grew tired of these too perfect creations and rushed the book to its happy conclusion. I kept anticipating the emergence of a savage twist, but it was not to be - all was happiness and light. I suppose Mishima may have written this as an allegory for what he (perhaps) secretly hoped his life could be - and I think John Nathan explained in Mishima's biography that he was influenced by a fascination with Greek legends and sculpture at this time - but thankfully he returned to the Mishima we love with later works.Can't say I would recommend this book, other than as an interesting part of Mishima's canon of work. The Vintage International edition is worth reading for their hilarious profile of Mishima - \`born into a samurai family, imbued with the code of complete control over mind and body and loyalty to the Emperor' - utter nonsense!"},{"Title":"The Sound of Waves","review":"Fifteen years ago I read this while on a Jap. lit. binge; I have since read all of Mishima's novels available in English (are there others not translated?), and this one remains one of my top two with Temple of the Golden Pavilion. I just re-read it over the past two days, and it has not lost any of its appeal.The characters and setting are reminiscent of Steinbeck, as in The Pearl, The Red Pony, and Tortilla Flats, yet the narrative has a pathos and philosophical sensitivity that provide insight into a deeper Japanese identity crisis as one prominent review detailed earlier. With a light touch of classic Mishima eroticism, this is an engaging read of the \\"root for the good guy\\" type."},{"Title":"The Sound of Waves","review":"June 5, 2008I just finished reading the Sound of Waves. It's a true to life account of life in a Japanese fishing island in the mid 1950's.What would people do without all their modern conveniences, luxuries and entertainments? They would probably live like the people of Uta Jima, finding joy in a simple life close to nature and their families and neighbors. When someone needs to fix their house, all their friends come to help out. When a young couple suffers a crisis, the whole village helps work out the problem. And being close to nature, even the Gods are there to lend their behind the scenes assistance.I recommend this book to anyone who would like to experience life in rural Japan."},{"Title":"The Sound of Waves","review":"I was forced to read this book by the Honors program at my school, and i thought it was pure revenge against the students from our teachers...but...After I started reading this book, I got addicted, and kept on reading and wanted to know what was going to happen next.

But then at my second time around I began to see the deeper meaning of what Mishima was trying to say.

I love the theme and the message that Mishima conveys through the book."},{"Title":"The Sound of Waves","review":"Japanese tend to be shy and meek people, which surprised me greatly to read the dramatically brief and stark blunt nudity scenes described in this book. Such an innocent cover, but this book really is full of shocks and surprises. This truely is a timeless story about two lovers, a rich female with a posessive and over protective father, who's intelligence we are incapable of knowing at first glance. Super."},{"Title":"The Sound of Waves","review":"The Sound of Waves, by Yukio Mishima, is the second book I've read by this author (The Sailor Who Fell From Grace with the Sea), and I can see the similarities in styles. I wonder if I'll recognize it in his other works.In The Sound of Waves, a young, poor Japanese fisherman is transfixed by the daughter of the island community's richest man. She returns his affections, but dissatisfied suitors begin a campaign of rumor that tarnishes their relationship, particularly with Hatsue's rich father.Author Mishima makes it clear that he had a critical eye regarding the topics and places he writes about. The reader feels the drudgery, and importance, of the various activities in a fishing community, plus the politics and dynamics of a small town. The ending can be faulted as being vapid, but still satisfying. Mishima seems to leave plenty behind for the imagination."},{"Title":"The Sound of Waves","review":"The Sound of Waves is, simply put, a story of romantic love woven from the simple life of a fishing village in post-war Japan. Mishima's book doesn't include vast social criticism, but rather hearkens back to a world where common people have simple dreams, and where right wins out in the end.The highlight of the book is perhaps the descriptions of people and nature, and especially the way nature affects people. Butterflies are signs, but Mishima makes clear that it is people who make them such, and not the gods. The sea and village are both backdrops to Shinji's and Hatsue's romantic coming of age, and their romance is on their own shoulders with only the feelings and ambitions of their rejected alternatives to stand in their way.A good read for any time when you're in the right amorous mood."},{"Title":"The Sound of Waves","review":"Mishima was such a great writer and this story is such a beautiful tale and full of nature and the angry sea. True love conquers all in the end I guess even if it's a cliche. This is easy to read and can appeal to any age from middle school to senior citizen. I recommend it as a gift to someone you love. This is so tame compared to his other darker but great other books. I'm sorry the world has lost this man."},{"Title":"The Sound of Waves","review":"This book is a great example of the perfect romance/love story; guy falls for girl, girl falls for guy, they get married, etc. However, Shinji and Hatsue had a lot of obstacles to overcome before they could be together. The characters did this with will power and personal strength, which I think is also major theme of the book. Not only Shinji and Hatsue show examples of this theme, but will power is also displayed by Shinji's mother and the mistress of the lighthouse. This theme is not immediately obvious, but many retorical devices of the book symbolize it, so there is an essance of it there, under the surface. The book shows a great tale of love; however, will power is what helped the characters obtain their happiness."},{"Title":"The Sound of Waves","review":"i've read many of mishima's later works, and was surprised by the gentleness and simplicity of this story. while lacking the undercurrents of torment and eroticism he later developed, this poetic little novel is timeless."},{"Title":"The Sound of Waves","review":"I read this book, and it was really nice. It talks about a young man named Shinji and how he falls in love with a young woman named Hatsue. They can't let the neighborhood know that they like eachother because Hatsue is more upper-class. It has a wonderful story line and I reccomend this book to people of all ages...but especially to teenagers who love to read about love stories."},{"Title":"The Sound of Waves","review":"Richard Hugo, an excellent poet and teacher, said that each poem has two subjects - the triggering subject (or the story), and the second, deeper subject. This holds true for many great works of literature, not just poems, and The Sound of Waves is no exception.On the surface, we have a subtly erotic love story about Shinji and Hatsue, two hard-working young Japanese people in a close-knit, isolated, traditional village. They go on with their romance despite ugly rumors which prompt Hatsue's father, Terukichi (known as &quot;Uncle Teru&quot;) to forbid his daughter from seeing Shinji. There is a happy ending, but I won't give it away.This is more than your typical love story. The main characters, Shinji and Hatsue, are ideal Japanese people in the traditional, uncorrupted village: hard-working, devoted to the family, honest, and religious. The rumormongers are Westernized: Chiyoko - a pessimistic girl - is a student in western literature at a city university, and Yasuo - a rude, selfish, lazy boy who wants Hatsue for himself - is well-read in pulp magazines. It is traditional Japanese willpower and discipline that keeps Shinji and Hatsue together despite their obstacles.What is remarkable is that the book does not make its point with a sledgehammer. The traditional characters win out, not because they tattle or scream; their integrity forces the modern characters to face the errors of their modern ways. This book is almost as relavent to our changing America as it was to Mishima's changing Japan. One read-through and you will understand Mishima's patriotism, his long quest for a return to tradition that led to his seppuku."},{"Title":"The Sound of Waves","review":"Few books accurately capture the feeling of first love the way Yukio Mishima's &quot;The Sound of Waves&quot; does. Set in a small Japanese fishing village in the mid-20th century, this is a beautiful story that will charm the romantic at heart with its simplicity and intensity.Shinji is a poor young fisherman, living with his widowed mother and relatively carefree. That changes when he sees a lovely young pearl-diver named Hatsue looking out to sea. Shinji soon finds that he can't get Hatsue out of his mind; he's fallen in love, for the very first time. She soon falls in love with him as well -- it's first love for them both, and for a few days everything seems fine.But things start to go wrong when an unhappy young girl sees the two of them leaving a secluded spot. Soon rumors are spread about Hatsue and Shinji's relationship, and the arrogant Yasuo even physically chases Hatsue when she is getting water. When Hatsue's overprotective father forbids her to see Shinji again, and seems about to betroth her to Yasuo, Shinji has only one chance to be reunited with his love.Generally the word &quot;romance&quot; conjures images of busty half-naked women being held in impossible positions by chiseled he-men with torn shirts. But &quot;Sound of Waves&quot; is genuine romance, about the sort of love that any person could experience if they are open to it, in any part of the world. He is also one of the few authors who can convey the joy and pain of being in love. Not to mention the exalted way one can feel, without losing sight of their humanity: Shinji and Hatsue definitely have hormones, but keep them in check. There's a kind of mature innocence to how these two interact.Yukio Mishima's writing is both brief and detailed. Simple and descriptive, evoking the wind, sea, trees, and shorelines. The story is a simple one (boy meets girl, girl and boy fall in love, boy and girl are separated, etc), but its simplicity is part of its appeal. There are even some things about pearl-diving and fishing included, to give a glimpse of the lives that Hatsue, Shinji and their families live.The best thing abou this brief novel is the lead characters. Shinji is a shy, inexperienced, capable teenage boy, not a confident stud. Hatsue captures his attention not through mere physical beauty (though she sounds quite pretty), but through her sweetness. The wannabe-playboy, and the &quot;ugly&quot; girl who wistfully falls for Shinji, are like real people.This is romance as it should be written, beautiful and tender with lovable characters and haunting prose. What it lacks in complexity it makes up for in sweetness. A memorable and beautiful story."},{"Title":"The Sound of Waves","review":"A 16-year-old recommended this book to me because &quot;it has a lot of SAT words&quot; and I, being the SAT prep instructor that I am, had to investigate. My young pupil was indeed correct in saying that the English translation of this book contains many words commonly seen on the SAT, but she failed to mention how incredibly well-written the book was, too!I had a very hard time putting down this book simply because it flows so beautifully. Words are not wasted; everything is said for a purpose, from the desriptions of the scenery of this small Japanese island to the descriptions of the sunburnt faces of the main characters. Mishima tells the story of a forbidden love that doesn't become too sappy sweet. It is refreshing to read a novel that focuses so much on human character traits (&amp; flaws) while also leaving room for serendipity &amp; fate.An easy read with a nice plot and excellent character developments, this book is highly recommended to readers of all ages. And if you happen to know of a high school student who wants to improve his/her vocabulary and critical reading abilities (or you happen to be one), then this is the perfect book for you! You won't regret it!"},{"Title":"The Sound of Waves","review":"Yukio Mishima wrote The Sound of Waves following a visit to Greece and his immersion in the literature of ancient Greece. His fascination with the Mediterranean world and his affection for ancient literature (in particular, Daphnis and Chloe) is reflected in this sunny novel. He produced a very approachable and charming story about a island fishing village, and it is no wonder that this book was the first selected for translation into English in 1956 (published in Japan in 1954).The novel centers around Shinji, a young fisherman, and Hatsue, who had been given away by her father Terukichi but was called back by him when his son died so he could marry his daughter and adopt the husband into his family. The story follows what one would expect in a small village where everyone is known and gossip abounds. It is assumed that Hatsue will marry Yasuo, who is from a family that is well off whereas Shinji is poor. Love, however, takes a different hand and when Shinji and Hatsue see each other something begins that cannot be stopped. Of course, there are obstacles in their way and Terukichi places his daughter under house arrest because of the gossip that has grown over their relationship. But the reader understands early that Shinji is bound to triumph over adversity and win Hatsue because his character is noble and hard-working. I don't think anyone would doubt the end of the novel; it is the character development and Mishima's powers of description that keep your attention.What adds so much to this novel is Mishima's description of island life. For example, he brilliantly describes the women divers who struggle to bring up abalone and notes how they cut their toes when they use their foot to push off the sea floor. We also have descriptions of the men of the island relaxing in the bath-house, the meetings of the islands Young Men's Association and such mundane tasks as the women fetching water from the local spring.Mishima's fascination with the cultures of the Mediterranean did not last long and he repudiated The Sound of Waves. This novel may not be characteristic of Mishima's writing but it is a good place to start to get to know his writing before advancing on into Confessions of a Mask. The Sound of Waves is a lyrical and sunny book that deserves a high readership."},{"Title":"The Sound of Waves","review":"A subtle and masterfully told tale about two youths discovering love on a rural Japanese island. This book is very different from the other 5 or 6 Mishima novels I've read, but it is still beautifully constructed and skillfully rendered.The book explores themes of innocence, loyalty, fidelity to tradition and the transition from adolescence to adulthood. Despite the lack of &quot;action&quot; in the book, the story is still riveting because of the chasm between rumor and truth that the protagonists must cross.Mishima definately adds a unique twist at the end that is sure to irritate some and I was a bit perplexed about it myself for a while. Then I remembered this is a Mishima novel and we certainly wouldn't expect anything less from a man capable of such grave seriousness, outlandish specatcles and biting humor."},{"Title":"The Sound of Waves","review":"I found this book to be very unique, which is why i loved it so much. Though it's for a more mature audience. At my school it was such a controversial book because some of the sexual content. Though i'm glad that the teachers won the battle agains't the parents of banning it. That's what created the mood in the story, without it, it wouldn't be The Sound Of Waves. A very good romantic book, it will draw you in, you'll feel your in it."},{"Title":"The Sound of Waves","review":"Yukio Mishima's THE SOUND OF WAVES is, on its face, a classical and infinitely subdued love story, a Romeo and Juliet tale without the tragedy. A young but poor fisherman, Shinji, falls deeply in love with Hatsue, daughter of the wealthy businessman Terukichi Miyata who has just returned to her small home island of Uta-Jima (Song Island) during a vacation break from her studies. Hatsue reciprocates Shinji's amorous interests, and the two exchange secret messages and arrange covert (but essentially Platonic) trysts. The more sociably acceptable match, Yasuo, also desires to marry Hatsue, and her father presumably leans toward this better arrangement. Yasuo's marital goals are further aided by Chiyoko, daughter of the island's lighthouse keeper, who informs Yasuo about the young couple's illicit romantic escapades because she fancies Shinji for herself. Unknown to Shinji (but patently obvious to the reader), Uncle Teru recruits both young men to work on one of his ships in order to gauge their character and test their mettle for their marriageable worth to his daughter.Of course, for the ultranationalistic Mishima, the story provides little more than literary cover for his philosophical leanings. In that regard, THE SOUND OF WAVES operates on several symbolic levels. First is the question of fate versus free will - are Hatsue and Shinji fated to be together, or are their actions (and those of others) the driving forces from free choice that bring them together. Mishima offers events on both sides of this issue, from Hatsue's writing of hidden notes and Shinji's courageous actions on Uncle Teru's ship during a bad storm on the one hand to the interventions on the other hand by Nature in the form of an angry wasp when Yasuo attempts to seduce Hatsue during her late-night water drawing and during Hatsue's chance meeting of Shinji at the island's former military observation tower.Second is the question of individuality versus community - do Hatsue and Shinji owe more allegiance to the good of their island community and their respective families than to their personal feelings for one another? Mishima idealizes the traditional Japanese cultural emphasis on community and family over the welfare of the individual, presenting a Japan that now seems hopelessly nave and outdated. Every character is ultimately selfless, acting with saintly virtue and atoning for earlier sins and errors before the story's end. Not surprisingly, virtue is its own reward, and each character's selfless action leads, against all societal odds, to a fairy tale ending.Mishima's characters on Uta-Jima live outside of time - like Rousseau's noble savages or Paul Gauguin's Tahitian natives, they live in a world where a healthy and virginal adolescent boy and girl can like naked in each other's arms without apparent thought of consummation. The only person who displays a sense of heightened sexuality is the author himself, who repeatedly demonstrates a female breast fetish that can only be described as disturbing. Life on Uta-Jima projects an Eden-like simplicity, so utterly withdrawn from the modern (i.e., real) world that the story itself could be taking place any time from 1750 to 1950. Not until well into the novel do we discover that World War II is already history (obviously never having touched this Eden) and that the Korean War is underway. Only in the last several chapters of this book, as the story reaches its denouement, does the modern world impinge ever so lightly on Uta-Jima and its inhabitants. Mishima may well have been lionizing them, but to the modern reader's sensibilities, they appear (with the exception of Uncle Teru) as hopelessly childlike, ill-equipped for the Japan we know is charging toward them from a decade or two down the road.THE SOUND OF WAVES is elegant in its slow pacing and narrow story line, illustrating a Japan that may once have existed - or perhaps it only ever existed in idealized form, in Yukio Mishima's mind. Regardless, the story line is classical, the writing as translated by Meredith Weatherby is lyrical, and the world it describes contrasts sharply with the militaristic leanings and violent har-kiri death of its author. Uta-Jima is a life some readers might wish still existed, while others may be glad that such backwardness and nave isolation have followed Mishima into increasingly ancient history."},{"Title":"The Sound of Waves","review":"I read Mishima's \\"The Sailor who fell from Grace with the Sea\\" years ago and while Sailor got rave reviews, I actually preferred this story.Mishima masterfully weaves a simple love story that, despite its Japanese setting, is evocative of youthful love everywhere. The sensitive protagonist is a hero the reader will root for from the first page; of course, it's partly a fairy tale we've read a thousand times before, where the peasant (fisher boy) falls in love with the princess (bourgeois daughter). There are no dragons slain in this tale, however, except those of personal dilemmas and our hero's inevitable rivals.A charming, heartwarming tale of unforgettable characters told with Mishima's trademark poetic simplicity."},{"Title":"The Sound of Waves","review":"Written in a simple yet lovely style that is vaguely reminiscent of Hesse's Siddhartha, Mishima's tale of innocent love and virtue is stirring. Unlike his customarily dark themes, he takes us to a small fishing village on a Japanese isle and creates a legend of two hardy youths that meet and fall in love. Despite their young age, their bonds are strong and through all their trials together you can't help but fall in love with them both. This is an excellent book that I would recommend to any reader."},{"Title":"The Sound of Waves","review":"The book The Sound of Waves by Yukio Mishima first caught my attention when I read one of its short reviews saying that it is the story of first love set on a small Japanese island. I decided to read it and was not disappointed.The book starts when a young and poor fisherman, Shinji, coming back from his work catches a sight of a beautiful girl, Hatsue, a daughter of the wealthiest man in the village. The two young people meet and fall in love with each other - for the first time in their lives. As they set out on adventure of experiencing all joys of their feelings they also have to overcome all the difficulties their life presents them with such as gossips and ill-natured stories aroused by the villagers.Although this book's major theme is first love it is not the only one that compels the reader to take this book and to keep reading until the end. Yes, The Sound of Waves shows all the beauty of being in love for the first time, it describes all the feelings of wonder, joy and uneasiness that love brings. Also this book captures the beauty of nature of a small island, untouched by civilization. Between describing the adventures of the characters, Yukio Mishima takes time to describe the scenery around them - graceful pine-trees, powerful ocean and rocks on the beach. All of these have their own beauty and wisdom in them that teaches and helps any person from the island that needs it. People and nature in this book are intermingled with each other in some natural and powerful way.The island is very remote and has its distinct traditions and ways of living and thinking; and the book is excellent in portraying all of these. It describes the ways of fishermen and divers. The book shows the souls of its characters, their hopes and dreams, their reaching out into unknown and growing as a person while still being closely connected with nature and being devoted to each other and their island.The Sound of Waves is a fairly simple book, yet this fact does not make it less forceful. It does not complicate things but rather shows everything in naive and simple perspective full of events and feelings. If you are looking for some romantic and charming story, The Sound of Waves is your pick."},{"Title":"The Sound of Waves","review":"I was forced into reading this book by my Language Arts teacher, as a comparison to Romeo and Juliet. The book had excellent discriptions, but I'm afraid thats it. The plot was dull, you couldn't get to know the characters at all, nor could you begin to understand them in any way whatsoever. I would have given it a 3 if it wasn't for the last sentence, which left me angry and irritated, I won't go into it incase someone else actually wants to read it to find out, though I suggest against it.Also, there are some fairly graphic scenes with discriptions that I really didn't want to read."},{"Title":"The Sound of Waves","review":"this book is okay about 2 teeangers who fall in lve. nothing special..i had to read it for school and i was pretty much bored all the time but if you really wanna read this go ahead if u r in to all that love stuff"},{"Title":"The Sound of Waves","review":"I had to read this book &quot;The Sound of Waves&quot; by Yukio Mishima for school. We were supposed to read it and write about the human emotions that the book expressed. This was a very tough assignment because the book didn't express much. Even though the stroy is a love story the plot moves very slowly. This is because of the excessive despcription of even insignificant things throughout the story. If one were to cut the inane descriptions the story would be about 20 pages long. However, it would also be a much better story. The reader would be able to understand the true power of love that does manage to shine through all of the excessive imagery. Other than the fact that the author had to some how manage to make the book over 100 pages long the story is fair. It is interesting to all ages, prbably more to those interested in love stories and romance. Younger readers will get a taste of mid 1900's Japanese vulture as well as a pretty entertaining tale. Over all the book is fair. A good book to read to pass the time on a rainy day or a long plane ride."},{"Title":"The Sound of Waves","review":"If you want to read a romantic and straight forward book, Then The Sound of Waves, by Yukio Mishima, is right for you. This book have very easy ideas and easy to understand. It is like many other romantic stories and you can pretty much predict. For me I didn't really like the book because it is too concrete. I like to solve problem and figure out what is going to come next, but this book did not give me the chance to do so. However, the cover and introduction of the book really caught my attention and basically that is why I chose the book.The book is about two teenagers fell in love the first time they met. Unfortunately, both of them had an arrangement of marriage with someone else, so the two lovers need to go through some obstacle to get together. Both of them need to find ways to deal with their parent and people in the village.So if you want to read a book that is simple and easy to understand, then I recommend you to read this book.

If yer looking for Stephen King or Robert Heinline, you'll be disappointed--however, if you want something with some soul, READ THIS!!"},{"Title":"The Sound of Waves","review":"This is a story of young love in a fishing village in Japan. It is a gem. We have a simple boy, salt in his hair and dreaming of nothing more than owning his own fishing boat some day. And here is a simple girl training to be a diver after mollusks. (True, this particular occupation has been an object of cheesy soft-core since Hokusai and before, but . . . .) The story has a timeless quality--there is no other way to put it. The boats run on diesel, but it is no accident that our setting is an island, removed from the dust and distractions of Tokyo, where other stories by Mishima are studies in anxiety, squalor, materialism and so forth. There is no element of badness here, save a little jealousy and deceit which are painted as, in their way, natural things. As our young ones have their first thrills of intimacy in a secluded hut, their love seems to crystallize the tender innocence of the place, the sunburned faces and pine trees rustling in the salty breeze. Remember this old, old tanka:&quot;If only the world would always stay this way, fishermen drawing up their boats on misty banks.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Sound of Waves","review":"I noticed most of the people who gave this book 3 stars or less were grade schoolers who were assigned to read this. Being a grade schooler isn't so bad. But they probably gave it a low rating because they were assigned to read it. Being assigned to read something actually makes grade schoolers more critical of the book. Many times I hated a book I was assigned to read in grade school or college, only to pick it up years later and have greater appreciation for it. Hopefully, those kids will read this years later and see the beauty of this book.My quick review: the prose was lean and detailed. Themes include jealousy, gossip, misunderstandings, and hard work pays off. I liked the protagonist. He was simple but not simple-minded. So many times in my life I've let the negativity of others get me down. Petty people don't like humility; they think it is a sign of weakness. Nor do they like confidence; they think it is a sign of arrogance. This book showed how harmless actions can cause petty people to get you into trouble. But the protagonist didn't let it get him down. I loved that about this book. He just kept being himself and working toward his goal. In the end, he was greatly rewarded while those who tried to bring him down were put to shame. I recommend this book to people who need to remember to keep going for positive goals; don't dwell on the foolishness of others; and your reward will be more than you expect."},{"Title":"The Sound of Waves","review":"Yukio Mishima does write some more complex novels (such as Spring Snow) but for a rather short, enjoyable, and quick read this novel is perfect. Though the translation is dated, it is still excellent. The story is timeless and transcends time and place.The characters are rather interesting, though not very well fleshed out due to the short length of the novel. While I did find the three main characters were much more important to the story, there are several minor characters who are incredibly interesting and intriguing, especially Hatsue's father.A lot of the book does deal with Japanese customs, but the reader can identify with these characters even from a different culture. Despite cultural differences, we all want the same thing, we all respect honor and loyalty and yearn for love and acceptance. A wonderful message and a wonderful book.Update 11/2011: After reading the Sea of Fertility tetralogy, I have become a great Yukio Mishima fan. This is a great short novel to get into his work. After reading this, Spring Snow is surely a great second novel to dive into."},{"Title":"The Sound of Waves","review":"This was a homework asignment project. The book was interesting but it would not be my choice for pleasure reading. Nothing wrong with the book or writing, Its just not my type of book to read."},{"Title":"The Sound of Waves","review":"The Sound of Waves is a simple and charming story about two young people falling in love, their trials and triumph, on a tiny island that lies in the straits connecting the Gulf of Ise with the Pacific. The 1400 inhabitants of Uta-jima (Song Island) live in a tightly woven, stratified society that mirrors the larger Japanese culture in its essentials, though the island has been bypassed by much of the postwar modernization sweeping over the rest of Japan.Shinji is 18 when the story opens, a recent graduate of high school where he earned notably poor grades. His inclinations propel him in another direction: that of the robust physical outdoorsman, working on a small fishing boat earning a living harvesting mainly octopus from the sea, whose presence dominates the lives of all the islanders. Shinji's mother, a widow, ekes out a living as a diving woman.The island's calm routines rarely ever change; thus it is a topic of conversation when a new face turns up on the island. Shinji first sees the unfamiliar girl on the beach as he is going to visit the lighthouse keeper, and later, on the fishing boat, he learns that she is the daughter of Uncle Teru Miyata. One of four daughters, Hatsue, had been put out for adoption to a family of diving women on another island. But when Miyata's only son was killed, he called her back, had her put back in the family register and decided to adopt a husband into the family for her to carry on the name.Shinji's dormant adolescent feelings have been stirred by his encounter with Hatsue, and he suddenly finds himself distracted by thoughts of her. At the same time, he is reminded that his lowly station in life places her beyond his reach. That night, at a meeting of the Young Men's Association, Shinji learns that Yasuo Kawamoto, the son of a prominent village family, has been invited to a homecoming celebration for Hatsue. It would appear that Kawamoto, whose social standing eclipses Shinji's, is Hatsue's father's likely choice for his daughter's future husband.The rest of the story relates the growing attraction between Hatsue and Shinji, and the rivalry between Shinji and the self-important Kawamoto, who assumes that he will prevail.Eventually Hatsue's father arranges to have both Shinji and Yasuo serve as apprentice seamen on one of his ocean-going vessels. Unbeknownst to either of them, he has designed this as a test of their mettle. The one who shows the greatest \\"get up and go\\" will win Hatsue's hand.The steamer sails for Okinawa to pick up a cargo. Shinji throws himself into the life of a sailor, while Yasuo slacks off and brags that he will become the owner of the ship when he marries Hatsue after the voyage (thus enraging the captain). A tense moment arrives when, setting out for home during a typhoon, the ship is forced to return to harbor. Moored to a buoy, the craft lurches in the storm-tossed sea. One of the mooring lines snaps, and the ship's officers are fearful that the others might come loose and they would be set adrift. The captain asks for a volunteer to swim to the buoy and attach another line.While Yasuo cowers fearfully, Shinji steps forward and dives into the turbulent sea. The mission, though fraught with tension and danger, is a success. The ship rides out the storm and sails for home.Teru announces that he has decided on Shinji as a husband for Hatsue. The reports of the ship's captain have convinced him that Shinji has the most \\"get-up-and-go.\\"It was deceiving to read this book before taking up Temple of the Golden Pavilion and Confessions of a Mask. In those books, written before Sound of Waves, Mishima's complex personality is exposed: his self doubts, homosexuality, obsession with death and blood. Compared with these works, Waves seems completely out of character. The plot is romantic, the characters wholesome and one-dimensional. Even the world they inhabit, an island, stands apart. One wonders why he wrote it? Was it because he knew this story would be a resounding commercial success? Mishima's biographer John Nathan relates that Mishima referred to TSOW as \\"that joke on the public.\\"There were, apparently, other commercial novels that remain untranslated. Mishima seems to have pursued two parallel careers, one that brought him predictable financial rewards, the other a riskier artistic path (that nonetheless brought great fame, commercial success, and Nobel Prize nominations). The duality resembles that near schizophrenic divided personality that drove him to extremes throughout his life."},{"Title":"The Sound of Waves","review":"It's a young romance. Usually I don't like romances, but this one made a lot of sense. It gave a sense of innocence; gave actual typical adolescent behavior; coming to terms with infatuation, sexuality, and pride; and a great moral in the end. Beautifully described about village islanders' situations and everyday life. After I read this, I wanted to get this story in the original Japanese, just like Mishima's \\"Temple of the Golden Pavilion\\"."},{"Title":"The Sound of Waves","review":"This book is not like all the other love novels because it seems to deliver from a different background (actually, it does deliver from a different background). If you have read The Temple of the Golden Pavilion by Yukio Mishima you may like this book. And if you haven't read the Temple.....then you should. This man was a genius, many saw him as disturbed as many geniuses were/are in fact. And for a little more background information, Yukio Mishima was the final person in Japan to commit honorable seppuku which is honorable suicide.

Definately a must read!"},{"Title":"The Sound of Waves","review":"Richard Hugo, an excellent poet and teacher, said that each poem has two subjects - the triggering subject (or the story), and the second, deeper subject. This holds true for many great works of literature, not just poems, and The Sound of Waves is no exception.On the surface, we have a subtly erotic love story about Shinji and Hatsue, two hard-working young Japanese people in a close-knit, isolated, traditional village. They go on with their romance despite ugly rumors which prompt Hatsue's father, Terukichi (known as &quot;Uncle Teru&quot;) to forbid his daughter from seeing Shinji. There is a happy ending, but I won't give it away.This is more than your typical love story. The main characters, Shinji and Hatsue, are ideal Japanese people in the traditional, uncorrupted village: hard-working, devoted to the family, honest, and religious. The rumormongers are Westernized: Chiyoko - a pessimistic girl - is a student in western literature at a city university, and Yasuo - a rude, selfish, lazy boy who wants Hatsue for himself - is well-read in pulp magazines. It is traditional Japanese willpower and discipline that keeps Shinji and Hatsue together despite their obstacles.What is remarkable is that the book does not make its point with a sledgehammer. The traditional characters win out, not because they tattle or scream; their integrity forces the modern characters to face the errors of their modern ways. This book is almost as relavent to our changing America as it was to Mishima's changing Japan. One read-through and you will understand Mishima's patriotism, his long quest for a return to tradition that led to his seppuku."},{"Title":"The Sound of Waves","review":"Certainly the &quot;nicest&quot; Mishima novel I've read -- sweet, even. It was wonderful to read this after some of his darker work; it shows that Mishima has a lucid grasp of both ends of the artistic and aesthetic spectrum, and is not necessarily preoccupied with being disturbing. While not my favorite, this is a fine, fine novel; where some of Mishima's other books will only appeal to some, The Sound of Waves I could easily recommend to almost anyone who doesn't make squinchy faces at the mere mention of classic literature."},{"Title":"The Sound of Waves","review":"A love story situated in a small little fishing village.I'm sure you can read the synopsis from the other reviews.

It's an easy read on a simple love story. My only complaints would be the time it took to get to my house and the spine had a little dent.

The book doesn't innovate in the genre, is a tad cliche, etc... yet somehow still manages to be captivating and interesting.Character development is part of it. I mean, the protagonist (Shinji) isn't some sort of uber-stud perfect guy (for once), Hatsue isn't very cliche either, though I can't pin down any reasons why. The main thing that I liked about it was that the characters seemed like _real_ people, not a cheesy-pickup-line-spouting product of a bad imagination.The story was a tad cliche, but was nonetheless very good. My main reason for liking the story is that it wasn't a few paragraphs of romance thrown into another story here and there just for kicks, the purpose of the book was to be a romance novel and nothing else. I say this in comparison to other stories, like the LotR movies, which threw in 5-10 minutes of Aragorn and Arwen being mushy (which wasnt even in the book) just to attract a wider audience and make more money...But anyway, I'm rambling... the point is that this book is GOOD.

The author of this book was an extreme patriot and lived during the second world war. I suggest this to anybody who enjoys good romances.

However, the cover and introduction of the book really caught my attention and basically that is why I chose the book.The book is about two teenagers fell in love the first time they met. Unfortunately, both of them had an arrangement of marriage with someone else, so the two lovers need to go through some obstacle to get together. Both of them need to find ways to deal with their parent and people in the village.So if you want to read a book that is simple and easy to understand, then I recommend you to read this book. Because it is so easy to understand, it does increase your reading rate and build up your vocabulary. Overall, this book is not too bad, and not the best."},{"Title":"The Sound of Waves","review":"At first read I was charmed by the book and thought a typical love story where the love always prevail. But then at my second time around I began to see the deeper meaning of what Mishima was trying to say. Throughout the whole story he uses the character to convey a tension between the carefree good spirit wildness of Shinji and Hatsue and the evil ill spirit controled spirit of Chiyoto and Yasou. I love the theme and the message that Mishima conveys through the book."},{"Title":"The Sound of Waves","review":"\\"The Sound of Waves\\" by Yukio Mishima appears to be a modern classic that is not holding up well to the test of time. It was one of the first modern literary novels coming out of postwar Japan to gain wide recognition and fame. Its 1956 release in English translation a decade after the close of World War II was perfect timing. It soon became a standard in English classes all over the United States. The book appealed on many levels: as exquisite lyrical literature; as a charming first-love and coming-of-age tale with strong moral overtones; but perhaps most importantly, as a subtle way to build better understanding about a culture that young Americans needed to accept with greater respect following years of war-induced Japanese demonization.I was only ten years old when this book came on the American scene, so I missed out on having to read it as a teenager. I read it for the first time a few days ago, more than fifty years after it was first published in English. I approached the book with great expectations, but I was sorely disappointed.First, I suspect much of the original beauty of this lyrical novel is lost in translation. There is still a great deal in the writing to be admired, but the words lack the sparkle of innovation that no doubt exists in the original Japanese.The story is endearing in its lyric simplicity, but it stretches the credulity of the modern mind. Perhaps I am too world-weary and academically well-read, but for me the story seemed far too unrealistic--more like a fairy tale. All was too rosy, too one-sidedly idealistic, too much the idyll--the perfect harmony of man and nature. I've read too much anthropology to know this is possible at any time, in any culture. The noble savage is, after all, a complete fiction. \\"The Sound of Waves\\" was Mishima's own delusional vision of a perfect Japanese past that was quickly slipping away. It was a theme he returned to repeatedly over the next fifteen years of his life before committing seppuku (ritualistic suicide) because, in his words: \\"I came to wish to sacrifice myself for the old, beautiful tradition of Japan, which is disappearing very quickly day by day.\\" Mishima certainly was not a man of sound mind.I see no continuing redeeming value to reading this fairy tale in the present day. In its time, it sparked an interest as a lovely tale about love in Japan--subconsciously, it helped move many toward a love of Japan. But those times are over. There is widespread tolerance and understanding of differing cultures.Today, there are far more compelling works of worldwide modern literary fiction, some written directly in English, that have more meaningful messages to convey to the modern reader--messages that may help us deal with the reality of the human predicament that we find ourselves in at this, the beginning of the 21st century--this an age of widespread terrorism and ecological disaster, a time where oil wars, water wars, global climate change, and famine loom on the not-too-distant horizon. Much modern world literature aims indirectly to helps readers comes to terms with these all too pressing comtemporary world issues. If you are not familiar with these books and themes, try reading most Booker Prize winning authors."},{"Title":"The Sound of Waves","review":"This is a book about two teenagers who fall in love. One of them is a Fisherman and the other is the richest man in the villages daughter. they both go through a lot of conflict in priving their love."},{"Title":"The Sound of Waves","review":"The Sound Of Waves is one of the best &quot;little books&quot; I've ever read. While there isn't much deep philosophical introspection, it is a brilliant story, crystal-clear, with no wasted words. It tells the tale of Shinji, a young man just becoming aware of his sexuality, and his love for a pearl diver named Hatsue. While the love story is very traditional and familiar, Mishima uses subtle and strikingly vivid imagry to make the book fully come to life in the reader's mind. Mishima was a body-worshiping homosexual, and like the romantic works of Pierre Loti, the boy-girl story is probably a cover-up for a boy-boy relationship. Mishima's lust for the male body comes out in this book during his descriptions of the young men at their club meating. The book's ending, a nice twist, also brings into focus that aspect of Mishima's philosophy and lifestyle. I enjoyed the book very much; it was good company during a sleepless night."},{"Title":"The Sound of Waves","review":"I was assigned to read this book for school and did not expect to enjoy it. Well, I was pleasantly surprised. Not only did I find the setting both sweet and unique, the characters were captivating and very well developed. After all, it's not everyday that one gets to see inside the life of a young Japanese boy as he falls head-over-heals in love with a strange girl he knows almost nothing about. When I finished the book, I immediately re-read all of the parts concerning Shinji's feelings, thoughts, etc. toward Hatsue. (I especially liked how Shinji and Hatsue keep on &quot;running into&quot; each other and planning to do so again!) Yukio Mishima lovingly weaves a tale which describes the feelings and emotions of a naive young couple as they discover what it is to be in love. If you like a rewarding and beautifully written romance story, this book is for you!"},{"Title":"The Sound of Waves","review":"Excellent book! One can literately feel the sea breeze and the sunshine coming out of this book. One strenght of this book is that unlike Yukio Mishima's other deeply philosophical works, this book is very accessible to everyone. Read it first for the fairy tale like love story, that can easily be done in 2 days. Then read it a second time to appreceiate it's literary value -- the simple but lively characterazation, the beautiful yet realistic protray of the island landscape/seascape.In a more subtle philosophical note, this book express Mishima's believe in the traditional Japanese values. Live simple, work hard, harmonize with nature, trust others, be self-reliance, be courageous; these are the strenght that gule the island people together and made them prosper."},{"Title":"The Sound of Waves","review":"Lovely cover to start with, and then Mishima's style in analyzing the life of the island is so real, he describes perfectly the responsibilities of the women and men in the fishing island and their life style...Shinji and Hatsue have an automatic attraction that leads the rest of the city to talk about the little they have. The biggest challenge they have is that Shinji the boy is poor and his social class puts him in a disadvantage compared to the son of the richest man in town. Hatsue's father decides to send the 2 boys on a fishing trip on board of one of his ships to test their manhood and choose a husband for his daughter...A book to read in a day."},{"Title":"The Sound of Waves","review":"Using fluid words, sparingly, Mishima weaves a tale which operates on many levels. On one level, this is a timeless story of coming of age and young love. On another level, it is the story of a Japan rarely seen, that of a small fishing island off the main island. Or, it is a story about words, meaning only Mishima can write such fluid, crisp, and spare prose which are both poetic and descriptive. The gift of this novel, as in most of Mishima's work, is not in the story, but in the way it is told."},{"Title":"The Sound of Waves","review":"When I picked up this book, the book jacket said something like &quot;And so, Mr. Mishima uses a simple setting of a fishing village to create an unforgettable love scene of amazing tenderness and purity.&quot; I remember being skeptical about this, thinking &quot;Tenderness? In this century? Pshaw! This Mr. Mishima must be full of it.&quot; And I've never been happier to be wrong.The Sound of Waves is not a multi-faceted epochal genre-shattering masterpiece. And it's all the better for it. It's an extremely simple love story set in a remote Japanese island where the people work all their lives fishing and/or diving for pearls. And it's beautiful. The book jacket was right on. Hatsue is portrayed with such amazing tenderness and sympathy on the author's part that she becomes a human being, but she's not the only one. The &quot;ugly girl&quot; who falls in love with Shinji is also an amazingly real person. As is Shinji's mother, as is almost everybody else. It's incredibly refreshing to finally read an author who eschews all that arty &quot;deep complex psyche&quot; crud for the sake of such simple, yet unmistakably _human_ characterization.Sometimes the language seems a little clunky - this is entirely the fault of the translation. I imagine it must sound even more beautiful in the original Japanese. (And the translation is no great impediment - come on, this book _is_ extremely short.) In short, this is why humanity invented writing - so authors like Mishima could write books like The Sound of Waves. Now, I've only read three of his works, so it's theoretically possible that he has surpassed The Sound of Waves somewhere else, but I doubt it. Remarkable."},{"Title":"The Sound of Waves","review":"Mishima wrote The Sound of Waves after a European trip whose highlight was ten days in Greece. In form and texture the novel has a myth-like feel, and it extols the classical virtues of discipline, forbearance and honoring tradition. This book has an earnestness that sets it apart from the self-conscious posturing so prevalent in other Mishima novels.Shinji, a teen age fisherman on a small island off the coast of Japan, falls in love with Hatsue, a robustly beautiful abalone diver who is the daughter of the richest man on their island. Hatusue's father opposes her love for the poor but virtuous Shinji, wanting her to marry the better connected Yasuo instead. The lovers persevere in the face of this obstacle, Shinji's mettle is tested on the high seas, and, without revealing the ending, let's say that readers of traditional romance stories will not be dismayed by what happens here.Years after its publication, Mishima tended to treat this novel, which was wildly popular and almost immediately turned into a movie, as something of a joke he had played on the public. (Though it's easier to see why this book, a sort of Japanese version of Love Story, was so popular, as opposed to Norwegian Wood, Murakami's twisted tale of young love that was equally popular a few decades later.) But Mishima has put significant craft and effort into The Sound of Waves, such as gorgeous descriptions of the rugged, isolated island, and a a real feeling for the sweaty rhythms of fishermen's work. The anguish and ecstasy endemic to young love are delicately, fluently evoked. We find no traces of authorial snickering in either the plot or the prose.If we take the novel at face value - a sincere attempt to tell a timeless love story in as emotionally honest and straightforward a way as possible - then we can also view it as Mishima's attempt to embrace the traditional Japanese virtues of modesty, self-effacement and following the rules. If this book is Mishima's attempt to adopt the mindset of a \\"normal\\" Japanese, something he was constitutionally incapable of being almost from birth, then the novel takes on a poignancy that is not specifically derived from the story. The boy may get the girl, but Mishima will never get the comfort that comes from being part of the herd. Instead it was his fate to soar high, and, like Icarus, pay the ultimate price for his presumption."},{"Title":"The Sound of Waves","review":"I read this book for my senior summer reading and I was stunned by how it soon engulfed me. I just couldn't put down the book! The characters and story were well developed and there was always something to keep you in suspense. It is definitely a great romantic novel."},{"Title":"The Sound of Waves","review":"Written in 1954, this is Mishima's fourth novel and one that stands out from his more famous works in a number of ways.Mishima is mostly known for character introspection; dark, mysterious protagonists whose psyches are peeled away chapter by chapter. \\"The Sound of Waves\\" isn't like that. It's not like many Mishima novels that I've read.It's a simple love story. Kind of reminiscent of the one told in \\"Spring Snow\\", although here, we're given a more minimal brush stroke from the writer in that the story's setting takes place on a very small, secluded island off of mainland Japan.Though it would be easy to label this as typical Japanese romance-drama, it's really more than that. It shows a writer coming out of his shell and holds some very beautiful passages that I would attribute only to Mishima. He writes in a way that is very personal for me, so I guess I'm a little biased, but this is a great piece of work.Like the tide pulling sand from a beach, Mishima's place in literature becomes more apparent with each novel I progress through."},{"Title":"The Sound of Waves","review":"The story Mishima tells of the love between a young fisherman and a pretty girl newly-arrived into his tiny world is sweet and touching in itself. However, peeling back the layers of the love story reveals Mishima's sense of Japan and its place in history.The Japanese nationalism lurking underneath the simple story is evident only upon further understanding of Mishima's life and writings. There are far away lands where wonders exist that could not be seen on Shinji's small island, but these things lose their meaning once they are out of sight. Shinji himself is young and strong, a metaphor for the Japan that Mishima imagined.A very good book for the beginning reader of Mishima. A second read is warranted to understand the nationalist underpinnings of his writing, though."},{"Title":"The Sound of Waves","review":"Sound of Waves is a story of 2 young teenagers falling in love with each other on a very strict island. In the book Sound Of Waves, the most memorable part was the letter writing between Hatsue and Shinji. Shinji and Hatsue meet at the light house and Shinji gives Hatsue a seashell. My favorite character is Hatsue because she knows how to defend herself from others. She is not a type of person that likes to be pushed around by others. What I liked about the book was when Shinji and Hatsue met each other at the light house and Shinji pretended to be asleep while watching Hatsue getting undressed. The part I didn't like was that Hatsue's father prohibits her from seeing her boyfriend. Hatsue's father would not see Shinji's mother. The book has a happy ending."},{"Title":"How to Raise and Train a Bedlington Terrier","review":"Offers much insight into this rare breed. A must have for any Bedlington enthusiast."},{"Title":"Viva Heather (Magic Attic Club)","review":"I was thrilled to read this book to my daughter. Using a magic mirror fanatsy, it tells the story of a young Jewish girl as they were expelling the Jews from Spain, Thereby telling &quot;Heather&quot; the story of her ancestors. As a woman of Sephardic Jewish Heritage, this story was a pleasant surprise. It tells an story not only of Jewish history, but of the strength of a young girl. A great way for girls to see what they can be, either through fantasy or reality."},{"Title":"Viva Heather (Magic Attic Club)","review":"\\"Viva, Heather\\" is a book that entertains while it educates about the Jewish faith. The reader is quickly drawn in by Heather's realistic feelings about her family and her faith. At the beginning of the book, Heather is embarrased by the visible signs of her faith as her family celebrates the Passover. All she can think about is the matzoh (unleavened bread/cracker) her peanut butter and jelly sandwich will be on for her school lunch. Heather is then morified when her grandmother invites her friends to the seder, and hopes that they won't accept. How will they understand the long stories and strange food?Through the magic of the mirror, Heather dons a gypsy outfit and is transported to the Alhambra castle in Spain. She quickly finds herself on the run and hiding her Jewish faith. She, and other Jewish people, must escape Spain or face death because King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella want Spain to be unified in one Catholic faith. Faced with such an intense experience where she had to deny her faith while hanging onto it, Heather learns that there are plenty of reasons to be proud of who she is and where her family has come from. Sharing the seder with her friends becomes something more meaningful to her.\\"Viva, Heather!\\" is my favorite book in the Magic Attic Club series because it tells the story of early persecution of the Jewish people in Spain at the beginning of the Inquisition. Based on information from a person who has interviewed the author, it is also the author's favorite book in the series because it is a part of her own family history. She has made this book something that children can relate to by adding the identifiable character of Christopher Columbus, which will anchor children to the place and time period. The author's expression of Judiasm and Heather's experience of it is something that children will also be able to identify with and find a positive feeling about. By the end of the story, Heather understands herself and her family traditions a lot better, and she gives the reader something valuable to ponder."},{"Title":"Chinese Theories Of Reading And Writing: A Route To Hermeneutics And Open Poetics (S U N Y Series in Chinese Philosophy and Culture)","review":"Whenever I go to the library of our university, I always go to the shelfs for books that have just arrived. One day, I found standing on the shelf a book titled \\"Chinese Theories of Reading and Writing: A Route to hermeneutics and Open Poetics\\", written by Ming Dong Gu. I was immediately attracted to it. It is a unique book, thoughfully conceived and well written, coming out just in time. This book represents a breakthrough, I think, in the field of comparative study of Chinese and Western poetics, a field which is very active in the past ten years. It is of such a high level, I can only admire the author's accomplishment. Certainly, this book represents the highest level reached in the study of Chinese and Western comparative poetics in the last ten years. In many aspects, I have to describe what the book has accomplished as a breakthrough in the dialogues between Chinese and Western poetics. The topics this book writes about are obviously difficult: hermeneutics, semiotics, Chinese language, philosophy, poetry, Saussure, Lacan, Derrida, Eco, and so on. The author handles these difficult topics brilliantly, in his unique way, and in an easy-to-understand language. He not only delves into some important areas such as the Book of Changes, Buddhism and traditional Chinese literary theory, but also explores the philosophical basis of Chinese reading and writing clearly and artfully. Among scholars of comparative poetics, he is the first one to be able to relate the Dao with cross-cultural theory of reading and writing. Nowdays, many scholars in the field of sinology and comparative literature of Chinese and Western literatures have doubts about the compatibility for comparative studies of Chinese and Western literatures. This book gives us an optimist view. It convincingly demonstrates that Chinese and Western literatures have a common ground in hermeneutics and literary openness. There are many points I very much like in the book. For example, he made a fascinating distinction between Yi \\"meaning\\" and Yi \\"significance\\". It seems that a distinction between Yi and Yi makes no sense for people speaking in English. Even for scholars speaking in native Chinese, they are not always sensitive enough to consider their differences. Yet this author explains the two concepts in terms of You \\"being\\" and Wu \\"nonbeing\\" in a clear and brilliant way and makes sense of some fundamentals in Chinese theories of reading, writing and philosophy: The book is written with highest scholarship and deep insight. I would recommend it to anyone interested in Chinese literature, comparative literature, and comparative thought."},{"Title":"JAPANESE a language map","review":"As my wife and I prepare for our second trip to Japan, our fears of linguistic isolation are much smaller. This time around, we have taken conversational Japanese lessons and found out that the spoken language is not as hard as we expected (except for counting things, a real brain twister for Westerners). This Language Map helped us greatly on our first visit with the little questions, answers and bits of courtesy needed in any language. We will bring it again this time for a quick reference on the details we will inevitably forget.There is an English phonetic pronunciation beside each Japanese word or phrase. It may not be enough for someone with no knowledge of Japanese to pronounce the phrase correctly. The format of the Language Map may be too small to provide enough coaching (although, on the other hand, the compact size is a big plus). The Language Map does not inform you about the relative lack of inflection in Japanese compared to Western languages or the subtle inflections in many words. For example, many Americans think they know the Japanese equivalent of \\"thank you\\" and they almost always pronounce it \\"ah-ree-GAH-toh,\\" with a strong accent on the third syllable. Of course, that's not the way the Japanese say it, with something between flat intonation and a very soft accent on the second syllable. The phonetic pronunciations do omit all those unspoken or whispered u's (saying dess instead of desu, for example). The Language Map contains the common phrase \\"ikura desu ka\\" (how much is it) with the phonetic pronunciation \\"ee-koo-rah dess kah.\\" The first-time visitor to Japan may not notice the silent vowels.The Japanese may not understand us if we try to read the words provided here with English phonetic pronunciation. With luck, they would think it funny, perhaps even cute, and appreciate the effort we make to speak their language. A little knowledge of the basic rules of Japanese pronunciation would make this tool more useful."},{"Title":"JAPANESE a language map","review":"This is a very basic and easy reference that can be taken with you around town to refresh your memory as you go. The Japanese people really appreciate the effort to try and speak their language and are extremely patient as you look for the right thing to say. The more I used this guide the more comfortable I became actually speaking Japanese. If you have the time to take formal classes or use a Rosetta Stone program before you go great! However, this will still come in handy as a crutch until you become more comfortable."},{"Title":"JAPANESE a language map","review":"But too bad it arrived later than I expected, much later than other things I order and after our trip. It would have been great to have on our flight over. Wish I'd had it because it's very extensive, with everything you would want to know how to say to get around and be respectful. Get one if you can. I like the size, although it doesn't fold up and fit into a pocket, but I like the material, light plastic, all my city maps are the same. Our paper maps were huge and all developed tears in the creases. I don't know when I will be going to Japan again, but I'm keeping it. I recommend ordering things with a very comfortable time to receive them."},{"Title":"Dog's Colorful Day: A Messy Story About Colors and Counting (Picture Puffins)","review":"This book is a great way to review colors as well as a higher level thinking activity.

Dog accumulates spots one at a time [9 plus Dog's original spot], allowing the young person to practice counting from one to ten. Each spot that Dog accumulates is a different color [the original spot is black], allowing the young person to learn their colors. The art in the book is simple and effective. The story has some pretty farfetched elements [the bee making the yellow pollen spot on Dog, a splash from a mud puddle making the GREY(!) spot], but it's a fun story and the savvy adult can eventually discuss the plausibility of each spot with the more precocious child. The colors in some cases are different shades than I would have chosen to represent several colors, but the shades chosen do represent the colors they are supposed to. I enjoyed the book and think that it has more going for it than the typical counting or colors book.

So, you can teach your children about colors, counting (you can count the spots) and the importance of taking a bath at the end of the day.

After reading several books, I came across this one. THIS IS IT ! It is the ONLY book I have found that &quot;gets it&quot;. I have bought 5 copies - one by one - and have loaned them all out to friends and therapists whom I wanted to really understand what I was going through.This book was almost an obsession....I HAD to keep reading it. It also managed to give me some hope when I didn't think it was possible and wasn't looking for any.I'd buy a copy to keep for myself, but I can't find one....This one needs to be put back into print ! It may save lives."},{"Title":"Waking Up Alive","review":"Almost every book about suicide focuses on its causes, often chronicling the final descent of its victims. This heartfelt study does something different and long overdue - it examines the lives of \\"failed\\" suicides and lets them describe how they emerged from of the seemingly bottomless darkness that nearly claimed them. Harrowing in its depiction of the pain that fills the suicidal mind, deeply moving in its stories of overcoming that pain and living beyond it, this book is an invaluable resource. By the time you turn the last page, hope will be even more tangible to you than despair. A book that should be kept permanently in print."},{"Title":"Waking Up Alive","review":"Only 6 weeks after my own suicide attempt I read this book in the hope it would help me to understand this enourmous self destruction I had attempted.This books uses &quot;real&quot; people case stories (ones just like me!)and helped me understand that it wasn't my life I wanted to end but the pain and sufferring I had been enduring. Nothing else I had read put the overwhelming feelings I had experienced in to a readable understandable format.Richard Heckler went one step further, he gave me hope, as I continued to read, he showed me how other people had restored their lives and returned to life. It was his words that encouraged me to seeks the help I knew I needed. Now 18 months later I have completed my own trip - &quot;The descent to sucide and the return to life&quot;."},{"Title":"Waking Up Alive","review":"After losing my brother to suicide a few months ago, this book was recommended to me to gain an understanding of his mental state before he took his life.The author, Richard Heckler, articulates the suffering of one who is suicidal with great skill and insight. He also demonstrates a deep and clear understanding of the thought processes of those who have suffered long term and chronic pain, disfunction, and significant trauma.It was with terrible sorrow that I recognized my lost brother in these pages. It was equally painful to find myself in the accounts shared, but I was not left feeling hopeless. Dr. Heckler diligently presents the hopeful possiblity of relief from such despair.This is a truly wonderful book, written with profound compassion for those who suffer. I would recommend it to anyone who has survived the death by suicide of a loved one, and to those in pain who seek a deeper understanding of themselves."},{"Title":"Waking Up Alive","review":"A few weeks after a failed attempt at suicide, I found this book when searching for some understanding of suicidal feelings. When I read the stories and the quotes of those who have overcome the tempation, I felt that someone really did understand the way the mind narrows to the point where sucide is the only option. I bought copies for those who were surprised, and hurt, by my attempt. If you battle suicidal urges or want to know what it is like to enter the &quot;vortex&quot;, I would reccomend this very helpful book. I thank the author and all he interviewed."},{"Title":"Waking Up Alive","review":"Dr. Heckler, through his brief quotes of interviews and journals, was able to travel through the REAL LIFE experiences of about 50 people that had attempted suicide and survived. You will see a variety of processes that brought these individuals to the door step of death.Dr. Heckler is the ONLY person, involved in suicide research, to paint and define the components of the recovery from any attempt. You will see a very wide variety of recovery approaches. I feel the reader, whether a support person of someone who attempted or the attemptee, will gain TONS of insights into ways to start the process of recovery.... Litterly the most difficult task you will ever take on.."},{"Title":"Waking Up Alive","review":"I scoured my local library's website several days after being discharged from the hospital after my 2nd failed suicide attempt. I was desperately searching for hope and a reason for living. This book came up in the results. I borrowed the book from the library, and wouldn't return it until I had my own copy. This book changed my entire life! I suffer from Schizoaffective Disorder - Bipolar Type and have gone through many seemingly endless depressions, suicidal thoughts and feelings, and 2 failed suicide attempts. I knew I just couldn't live like that any longer. This book is the ONLY one of its kind. I owe my life and the quality of my life to this author...no joke. It was 2006 when I first read this book. Since then, I have had many depressions. Once in awhile a stray suicidal thought may have crossed my mind. But this book has given me so much hope that I knew I could never act on those thoughts ever again. It introduced me to a whole other perspective, that of the survivors of suicide attempts. Other books about suicide blandly talk about statistics, possible scientific reasons of why suicide happens/exists...this book goes beyond that and recounts at least 50 stories of people who have attempted suicide and survived, and then found hope in their lives, and a renewed reason for living, which is what I was so desperately seeking. This book, combined with my stronger-than-ever-desire to find hope and meaning in life, is what I think helped me to reach the point I am at today...I still suffer from depression at times, but rarely do I get suicidal thoughts. I've made the decision that suicide is NOT an option. This book showed me how I love life; I just don't like the pain and suffering from depression, and when I attempted suicide, I wanted the pain and suffering to stop, but not life. I didn't realize that then. Now I do, and my life is drastically different today that it was in 2006 and earlier. Thank you soooo much, Richard Heckler!!! &lt;3"},{"Title":"Waking Up Alive","review":"This is a very interesting book. It touches the human spirit - the resiliance of those who made a serious suicide attempt - and by divine (or otherwise) accident - survived the attempt and ultimately sought new ways of being. This book transcends pure intellectual research and delves into the emotional issues surrounding devastating emotional pain."},{"Title":"Waking Up Alive","review":"I had a hard time finding any books about people who have survived suicide and recovered from the reasons that took them there. While this book is written by a psychiatrist, it is mostly NOT an expert's book. What the author has done, really, is listen carefully to the stories of many suicide survivors, and then organize the salient information into a format that exposes certain patterns. The book takes the reader from the life circumstances & mind set leading up to suicide, through to the return to a life not dominated by suicidal thoughts. A key point seems to be that \\"normal\\" people see their lives as having viable options and choices that will create a life worth having, whereas those who are suicidal tend to feel things so painfully that they do not recognize/accept possibilities for improvement. It was helpful to me to read about how suicidal people made the transition to valuing their lives. In most instances, there was either a negative jolt, or an unexpected act of kindness that expanded the person's ability to see, imagine, and create positive factors in his life. Since the book is organized according to the stages of a suicide attempt, the reader gets multiple snippets from each person's life, and I sometimes found it hard to remember the bits that had come before. I might have preferred to hear all of a person's story at once, but that would have made it harder for the author to point out the commonalities of each stage. Overall, an excellent and much-needed book, both in content and style."},{"Title":"Waking Up Alive","review":"I have read several books on suicide, having someone close to me attempt. This is one of the best books that I have read to give an understanding of what the person might be going through. I have since purchased additional copies and given this book to others since i found it so helpful!"},{"Title":"Spelling (Longman English guides)","review":"TWILIGHT WHISPERS by Barbara DelinskyJanuary 14, 2005TWILIGHT WHISPERS by Barbara Delinsky is a reissue of a book that was originally published in 1987. It was also her first mainstream novel, after spending the first part of her career writing straight romance novels. I for one enjoy these mainstream novels, because I feel she's much better at them. Her romances don't seem to stand the test of time, but this book did.TWILIGHT WHISPERS is the story of two powerful and wealthy families, told from various view points but for the most part, centering on the murder of two of their members, Mark Whyte and his wife Deborah Warren. An outsider, Robert Cavanaugh, is the one that starts the book off, as he is the investigator for the murders and he starts the case by researching the history of the two families.While the murder plot line helped make the story move fast, what interested me the most was the family saga of the Whytes and the Warrens. Delinsky always does a good job with stories such as this, and I really liked the book. For those expecting a straight romance, this is not it. Look elsewhere. But for those who want more than just romance, read TWILIGHT WHISPERS. This book comes recommended by the Ratmammy."},{"Title":"Spelling (Longman English guides)","review":"This novel is part romance, part mystery, part family saga -- and while it lacks a clear categoric definition, I found all parts of story interesting. People are not always what they seem, and Delinsky does a very good job interweaving the tales of the various characters with the plot twists to a satisfying (if vaguely improbable) ending."},{"Title":"Spelling (Longman English guides)","review":"Dated, wordy and not one of her best. The focus is all over the place, although the book is written as mystery meets romance. Reminds me of the soap operas DALLAS and DYNASTY. Life is too short to re-read old books of this caliber, though Delinsky's more recent books are high on my list."},{"Title":"Spelling (Longman English guides)","review":"I prefer her &quot;meatier&quot; novels [More Than Friends, etc] as opposed to the &quot;harlequin&quot; style. This book falls right in between the two styles. Easy light reading thats more than a no-brainer."},{"Title":"Spelling (Longman English guides)","review":"I'm more of a straight romance fan so when I tried this fiction, I was shocked when the author went IN-DEPTH into the life histories of Katia, Katia's mother, Jordan, Jordan's parents, &amp; Mrs. Warren. The story felt like a cross between 'Lifestyles of the Rich &amp; Famous' and 'Dynasty' bec. those histories took up most of the book while the 'not-quite-on romance' could've fit into one chapter. Although not what I'm used to, the story was different yet unforgettable."},{"Title":"Spelling (Longman English guides)","review":"I got about 3 or 4 chapters into this book and had to quit. It had too many people in it and it was hard to remember who was who. I am a new Barbara Delinsky fan and have read about 6 of her other books. My favorite one so far is The Vineyard."},{"Title":"Spelling (Longman English guides)","review":"I should start by saying that Barbara Delinsky's newer novels are very good and I highly recommend them, however this book is a reprint of an '87 release and not at all like her newer ones. I was very disappointed in it-- it has poor character development and it's just all over the place. I had a very hard time even getting through the first few chapters. It did get somewhat better but resorted to sex to keep you hooked, which of course did not work....I recommend skip this book and check out one of her newer novels, like LAKE NEWS or COAST ROAD"},{"Title":"Spelling (Longman English guides)","review":"Detective Robert Cavanaugh feels an adrenalin rush, more drive than he's felt in years when he's assigned by his superior, John Ryan, to investigate a double murder case. Murder suicide would be the easy answer but he thinks not.Now, this isn't just any pair of dead bodies - the bodies belong to Deborah Warren and Mark Whyte, offspring of two of the most influential families to be found. Not surprisingly with a healthy does of power also has come unscrupulous behavior, none of which can be proven at this point. But there's bad blood in both families with father and son vying for political position.However, as Cavanaugh stands sweating in the July heat at grave side services for the deceased he watches intently as the Warrens and Whites unite in their grief. Was it real or a sham? If they were pretending they'd certainly had years to perfect their public personas.All that Cavanaugh knew at this point was that the couple had been involved in some rather kinky activities. The question running through Cavanaugh's mind is whether or not someone would actually murder members of their own family in order to preserve the carefully tended family image.Also important to the story is Cassie, the housekeeper who has tended to the family for a number of years. Her daughter, Katia, grew up with the Warren and Whyte offspring and is fond of all of them. As one might expect from Delinsky, Jordan Whyte and Katia provide a romantic interest.However, far from merely a romance, this is a murder mystery and a saga tracing the generations of two families.Kathy Garver, well remembered for her role as \\"Cissy\\" on television's Family Affair, is also an accomplished stage and film actress. Her performance of this story is graceful and well-paced.- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"Spelling (Longman English guides)","review":"This is the first book I've read of Delinsky's and I enjoyed it very much. It's labeled as fiction but it was a romance and mystery all rolled into one. I especially enjoyed the interaction between all the family members. I will be reading more of Ms. Delinsky's work. If this book only rated an average of 3 stars from its readers, imagine what a 4 or 5 star book must be like!"},{"Title":"Spelling (Longman English guides)","review":"This book would have been rated higher by me if there had not been repeated descriptions of explicit sexual scenes. It deserves an X rating for sexual content. I did enjoy the story line which I felt was a bit unusual. However with so so many different characters mentioned in the first few pages I almost gave up because it was difficult to keep them straight--which names belonged to which family, etc. I did decide to stick with it and gradually all the different names began to stack up for each family involved. I have read other more recent books by this author and don't remember such x rated scenes or I would not have picked this title up at my local library."},{"Title":"Spelling (Longman English guides)","review":"The story opens with the funeral of Mark Whyte and his wife, Deborah Warren. The two had been found on a boat, shot to death, and the press is labeling it as a murder/suicide. Investigator Robert Cavanaugh, however, is at the funeral looking for clues that may lead to what really happened on that boat. Taking photos and watching the individual members of both families in attendance at the funeral, the story initially takes Cavanaugh's point of view, but eventually changes voices, alternating among some of the other main characters.The press is going hog wild over this case, due to the fact that the Whytes and the Warrens are two very wealthy and powerful families. In some ways they resemble the Kennedys, with the patriarchs of each family being very strong and powerful men in their own right, while their children are following in their footsteps in one way or another. The double murders signal a downturn in the fortunes of these two families, and there are those who are glad to see this happen. Both men have hurt plenty of people during their rise to the top.At the funeral are the three families that are connected to Mark and Deborah. The heads of the Whyte family, Jackson Whyte, and his wife Natalie are there with their adult children. So are the heads of the Warren family, Senator Gil Warren and his wife Lenore and their children. Cassie Morrell, who had been in charge of the Warren household for decades, and her daughter Katia represent the third family.Katia, thirty years old, is the youngest of the children who lived on the Whyte-Warren estates, and was raised with the Whyte and Warren children, even though she was born to the hired help. Cavanaugh also notices that she seems to have a special relationship with one of the Whyte siblings, Jordan Whyte, who at the age of 39 is showing that he is following in his father's footsteps in more ways than one. With the help of his boss, John Ryan, Cavanaugh has a huge file of newspaper clippings and other journalistic articles that will aide him in the search for the answers to this murder mystery. Cavanaugh becomes obsessed with their history, living and breathing the case until it begins to disrupt his personal life.While the book starts off as a murder mystery, the bulk of this story is the history behind the three families. Victims of the Depression, both Natalie and Lenore grew up without much, but somehow find their futures with Gilbert Warren and Jackson Whyte, two men who were best friends and were going to move up fast in the world. Cassie finds that her life changes when she is hired by the Warrens to run their household. She eventually marries, and now her family is intertwined with the close-knit Whytes and Warrens.Delinsky moves the story along at a fast pace, delving into family secrets and relationships that are slowly revealed to the reader. There IS closure to the murder mystery, which this reviewer felt was settled a bit too quickly. But in reading a Delinsky novel, the ending is not always necessarily the most important aspect of the book. The many characters that fill the pages and make the story come alive are really what drive her novels. Delinsky's biggest talent is creating characters who are lifelike, three-dimensional figures who one can imagine in their heads. They are real people, not made-up caricatures that one often finds in novels.TWILIGHT WHISPERS is, above all else, a family saga with a romance built in and the added excitement of a murder mystery that the reader will want to solve. The fact that this book was first published in 1987 doesn't seem to make a difference in the enjoyment of the story today; it does indeed stand the test of time."},{"Title":"Mapping Hk","review":"The authors say this is a book for residents of Hong Kong rather than for tourists, but really it is ideal for the kind of traveller who is interested in how various cities work and &quot;feel&quot;. I bought this in HK while travelling there in 2001, and can attest that it faithfully and insightfully captures what Hong Kong is &quot;like&quot; (at least at a certain level).The format basically that of a photo essay, with high-quality photography of distinctive features of HK's urban landscape and often insightful commentary. The authors have a predilection for the language of postmodern continental philosophy, not usually my favourite reading, but sometimes used here to good effect."},{"Title":"Trading Card Techniques & Atc","review":"I'd rather pay a bit more and get more techniques such as in Artist Trading Card Workshop: Create, Collect, Swap by Bernie Berlin, BUT this book is worthwhile in that it covers a few things about how to cut paper without waste into the correct sizes and the techniques aren't for the most part covered in the other book or various others I've looked at, so I wish this volume were larger, but for the money, you are getting a good book.

Charles and T. Holtz. A.T.C.s /OR/ Artist Trading Cards add up to great fun for many, NOT necessarily artists or crafty types. You will learn that it does help if you're adept with scissors & glue stix because you work with tiny images. The cards in Vollrath's book show plenty of creativity. Mostly, it is IMAGINATION that counts.PART 2, after you have surrounded yourself with dozens of tiny cut-outs, is when you draw on your own artistry to work images into special pictures of a particular size: 2 1/2\\" x 3 1/2\\". Your skills will soon become honed. If working in a group 'rattles' you, worry not - that will subside & concentration soon become easier. The cards will not always be \\"limited editions\\".PART 3 requires some diplomacy which isn't exactly covered in this book, but you'll catch on quickly. In collecting A.T.Cs you will want to maneuver toward acquiring the most colorful & diverse collection of cards possible. ( Be diplomatic! ) Having an adequate notebook in which to display your cards to potential 'traders' is desirable. (You could use a baseball trading card album for starters). You may also want to try ONLINE TRADING.The authors compiled samples of their work with tips on the intricacies of the 'Art' and guidance about avoiding pitfalls.
