It is very insightful. Also a lot of fun to try to figure out other people's love language."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"Great information that has made a positive change in my life. I used this book along with The 5 Love Languages for Singles for my very first book club on my radio show. We loved the content and my listeners joined in with overwhelming insights during our round table discussion of the books."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"LOVE THIS BOOK! It's wonderful for helping with communication and understanding how communication conflicts can happen. It's not a be-all end-all type book but it's a good book that can help couples have more understanding in their relationship. They can also get back to loving as they understand why they do the things they do, what they need and how they can give to their partner. Another FYI - I use it in secular counseling.LOVE IT! :)"},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"This book is a great book to read. It breaks down the 5 love languages and it is very helpful."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"This book has been a real eye opener for me in my marriage. Once I realized my husband's love language (words of affirmation), I knew I had to change the way I was speaking to him in order to communicate love. And although he hasn't read the book, he now knows that my love language is gifts and has been amazing in treating me with what little we have. I love the way that this book hashes out the \\"in-love\\" feeling and teaches you how to deal with that transition and what to do when that period is over. Now, I am still very much in the \\"in-love\\" stage with my husband, but every once in awhile trouble comes our way. When it does, I have a lot more comfort these days re-affirming my love to him and receiving the same.This is a really good book and I would recommend it to everyone. It's easy to read, easy to understand and highly relatable no matter what stage of relationship you are in."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"I go to the Bible for everything, but this book HELPED out a lot when it came to my relationship that on some jagged rocks. It allows you to understand, learn, and discover things you have overlooked in regards to yourself and your significant other. I recommend this to teenagers, young adults, and adults alike. Whether you are courting, or are married- even single, this is a must read.It brings you bible verses and examples that break down what God is trying to tell you while you are learning more about you and your significant other's perception on how they receive and give love.MUST HAVE FOR A CHRISTIAN THAT IS COURTING OR MARRIED!!!"},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"Excellent relationship education. Wish I had listened to this years ago, it would have saved me a lot of pain and attempts at guess work."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"This book is great, read it because someone gave it to me, thought it looked silly though. I was really impressed, it is super simple, but in a life changing, \\"why the heck didn't I think of that\\" way. I just had my husband do the online test, and had him read the chapters on my \\"languages\\" and the two on his. I think that is why its somewhat redundant, somethings apply to multiple \\"languages\\". I love this book and I think that it applies to all relationships, and not just marital ones. Great insight on yourself and your significant other. Also, the online test is really accurate, I was very skeptical, but pleasantly surprised."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"I really truly believe that this book could prevent divorces. The concept of love languages is one of those light bulb concepts- once you get it, your whole view of love and relationships is illuminated.I first read this book as a teenager, and it was instrumental in 'detoxifying' my decade long relationship with my best friend. Once I started applying the concepts of speaking his language, our friendship grew closer and stronger- and that relationship has continued over the years, we're almost into our thirties!For my marriage, this book has been a key component in maximizing our marriage efforts- a turbo boost if you will, as the things we do carry exponentially more meaning when they are given in a language that is understood.This is a must-have for anyone in any kind of a relationship, not just a marriage. Its a book that I often give as a wedding present, and I've lent out my own copy so many times I finally just bought 3 more! Its a small book and a quick read, but the information you take away is monumental."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"This book has definitely helped my wife and I better understand each other, so that we have been able to better appreciate why we each do things, and have been able to improve our relationship.

My husband read it first; it really does make sense and gives insight to reasons that communication can break down.

I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to communicate better with any person :)"},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"Yeah this book is simple to understand but it is a good book. What you got to keep in mind is that just because something is simple to get doesn't mean it is simple to do day in and day out."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"The author takes a very casual approach in analyzing atypical problems in short term and long term relationships. It's very eye-opening to be able to take a step back and look at the reasons marriages fail and relationships fall apart. Just like the average person has their own fortes whether it be sports, cooking, math, or art, each individual has their own way to express themselves. It's just the same with emotions. No two individuals express themselves in the same way. We're all raised differently and in different environments which results in various ways of expressing and desiring affection. This book will help understand these ways and if the author's words are applied, will also help improve not just your marriage but all of your relationships."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"Insightful, easy-to-read, and powerful, The Five Love Languages takes a simple, but profound look at love in marriage. Whether your marriage is thriving, struggling, or seemingly dead, this book offers a unique outlook into expressing love to match your spouse's emotional needs. The Five Love Languages shows that love is possible after the in-love phase. As Dr. Gary Chapman illustrates, love is a choice, often difficult, but possible.A linguist myself, Dr. Chapman's approach to expressions of love as \\"languages\\" made his points easy to understand. I also could recall in my own experiences events where heartfelt expressions of love were not appreciated for what they were. How a costly gift, a tender hug, or some act of kindness was just insufficient. Now that I have read Dr. Chapman's work, I realize that it was because I was speaking the wrong love language in each instance; I was not matching another person's mode of receiving love. Others' attempts at demonstrating their affection for me have also become plain. Actions I thought insignificant or even hostile I have now realized to have been meant to show me love. The Five Love Languages is really more than just for couples--it is a handbook for all relationships.Disclosure of Material Connection:I received this book free from Moody Publishers as part of their Blogger Review Program. I was not required to write a positive review. The opinions I have expressed are my own."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"Highly recommend this book. It will help a lot of relationships thrive. You certainly will be glad you got it."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"I bought this as a gift for someone who recently went to marriage counseling. I thought it would be useful as the book provides \\"tools\\" that one can actually use. \\"Talk therapy\\" doesn't necessarily provide actual methods to improve one's relationship.I took a chance bc i didn't know how this gift would be received. However, the recipient expressed appreciation and saw value in what she had read thus far.I read the kindle format first and then purchased the book as a gift."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"Great book for a great price.

Had I read this first, instead of try to detroying what we had for over 13 years; we would have been celebrating our 20th anniversity next year. But I have to say God is a awesome God! We are in the process of the reconstruction of our relationship and this book has help me in my thinking and actions. I highly recommend this books for anyone on the verge of giving up.

It has helped me understand how to show love to my husband, my children, my in-laws and parents, my friends, my neighbors, and more. It even helps me relate to my co-workers and people I serve with in church. The biggest thing that I keep coming back to in this book is that many people tend to show love to others the way that he/she best like to receive it. They need us to show them love the way THEY need to receive it most.

I now don't get hurt feelings like before. I understand that he is different and shows his love for me in so many ways. It has taught me to appreciate his language of love and to tell him how much he means to me and how much I aprreciate what he does for me to show how he loves me. He doesn't talk about how much he loves me; but he does so many things for me and that is how he is expressing how much I mean to him. GREAT BOOK or C.D.'s"},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"This is a great new perspective on relationships (spousal or otherwise).

It's got great information."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"I liked the ideas of the book but don't understand why it has to be about Christianity. I didn't pay money to have it shuffle in my face over and over again. DISAPPOINTMENT"},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"A good friend of mine recommended the 5 Languages of Love to me, after I'd lamented not understanding my husband. In my defense, who can really claim to understand the opposite sex? After reading Gary Chapman's book, I can say that while I might not get all of reasons men do what they do, but at least now I can understand a little more of what makes them happy because I understand a little of their language.Love is what you do, not an emotion, which is why we're so confused by the whole thing. We think that once we say \\"I love You\\" with words than our partner should be good to go. Added to that fact, is that men and women think differently, and then we have different men/women thinking differently from the even that norm. What's to do? Why does love fade after the excitement of the chase, and subsequent catch?Gary Chapman does a wonderful job of identify the 5 languages we use to express our love, and then gives us a questionnaire so we can find what language our partner speaks so we can answer in the right way. He then gives suggestions on how to fulfill those needs so our significant other can feel the love we have for them.What's so hard about expressing our love, is that we express love in a way that would make us feel loved, and it might not be what our partner needs to feel loved. So, here you are doing what you think is the best thing a person could want, while your partner might be thinking you aren't feeling the love any more. How crazy is that? Well, love is crazy for the most part, but at least Chapman's book can help get us communicating in the way we want to be heard.I have to say that I was amazed at what speaking the 'right language' can make in a relationship. What would never work for me, works like a charm for my partner. Thank you Mr. Chapman. Here I was knocking myself out to do what I would want done for me, when I could have saved myself so much time, and trouble by doing what worked for my partner instead. It also helps to know what you want yourself, (after doing the quiz) so you can just tell your partner what you want. I maybe clueless most of the time, but I do know that men like it when they know exactly what they have to do to make a woman happy.Short, easy-to-understand book that can help a couple sail a little easier through the rough seas of relationships."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"I wish I had read this book many years ago.I've read many other books, and watched videos on relationships, like 'Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus', etc., but no other source has helped me understand what women long for the way this single book has.His explanations are so simple and to the point.I wrote the 5 languages on index cards and have them as book markers in my Bibles and other books I am reading, so that I can remind myself of each on a regular basis.If you've ever struggled with trying to figure out what your special lady is hoping for from you, buy and read this book.The mystery is finally solved."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"I think the basic concept is sound. Folks respond to different ways of showing love. I don't think the 5 categories are exclusive nor do they represent the universe of ways people best receive love and affection. The author addresses this last point somewhat by saying there are many dialects within the 5 languages. Some might view that as a cop out.My strongest complaint is that the language of the book is dumb downed to reach the lowest grade of reader. Like I say, the basic concept is good, but I was somewhat disappointed overall.The other thing is the book is more appropriate for long term relationships that have suffered thru neglect. I would have preferred to read something where the focus is on nurturing and sustaining the in love experience."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"I have to say that when I saw the cover of this book, I laughed.Don't let the cover fool you though, and don't let your pride either. If you are open to being a better mate to your partner, read this book. First and foremost you learn that every person has their own way of needing love. A lot of times, we give the kind of love that we would want in return. Although that seems like a sound principle, there are flaws in showing love that way.It will take you no longer than a couple days to read this book. But it could better your relationships for the rest of your life."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"I'll be honest I started this book with the best intentions but did not think it would help. I have to say it made me look at things at some-what of a different angle. Very informative. I never thought I would read something like this, much less read something like this and enjoy it. My advise is to get it, read it, enjoy it and maybe you might learn something. I know I did. Thank you for reading."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"This book is well written, easy to read, and simple to apply. This book will help you in your relationships and/or marriage. It came highly recommended to me and I highly recommend it to others. I bought several copies to give as wedding/Christmas gifts."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"THE 5 LOVE LANGUAGES is an excellent book for any couple to improve their marital relationship. If you are a man, however, if you won't be sharing this with your spouse or significant other; I suggest you get the one written specifically for men. The relationship building practices in this book can be adjusted for any kind of human relationship. Regardless of your situation, these techniques are invaluable to polishing even the best relationship."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"Definitely a book for the newly married couple as well as the long married couple. You will be able to identify your spouses love language and then be able to concentrate on building a stronger relationship because of it."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"As an emerging business coach, 5 Love languages was referred to often by my coaches, not only to discuss love languages but to make the point that everyone uses many languages to relate to others. I really enjoyed and benefited from the perspective, it is a great book to share with your life partner--we are closer than ever --did both of us reading this make a difference? Maybe so. I took away many valuable perspectives--everyone can benefit from. There are a few books I've read recently that I feel would have helped me a better mother,spouse, and business partner. This is one--enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"This is a fantastic book. I would recommend it for everyone. Happily married, unhappily married, single, dating. Anyone can read it and find it beneficial. Learn more about yourself, the ones you love and the ones you have loved.

A must buy!"},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"This book is truly an eye opener. I never really thought about the fact that my fiance' may feel love differently from the way I feel it.

I have already suggested this book to several friends and couples that I know."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"Recommended by a friend and the books seems to be good. Only half way through it. But the advice is sound, its doing it that counts."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"This book makes so much sense. I find it interesting when you discuss it with others that people immediately know what \\"love language\\" they are and what you are too! My husband doesn't exactly get my \\"love language\\" so reading this book together was very insightful to him and therefore beneficial to our marriage. Now we can look at our kids and see what matters to them too. Great read!"},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"I believe Dr. Chapman captured the essence of what was totally wrong in my past relationship. I have learned from mistakes from this book and though I am in no rush to get back in to my past relationship or with someone new, I feel empowered by this book to look a my relationships in a new way and willing to start out speaking the right love language now instead of trying to be reactive with the tools in the book after I have a problem. I do feel that you have to make sure your spouse is willing to read the book as well to engage him or her in what you are trying to change in the relationship though Dr. Chapman does provide one relationship example where the husband never meets Dr. Chapman the wife has sessions with him alone and the husband never reads the book, yet they still find a way to love again through the wife's efforts. I think that is very difficult but possible. Good luck readers I hope this helps."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"I ordered this for my bookclub and it was a hit by all who read it.

There is no more clear and simple way to communicate this information than the author has done. I knew some of these things, and it gave me some self-realization when reading this book. I was completely in-sync with his writing and his examples. I have lived some of these things and the book really felt like it was written for me. There is no way this book was actually written for me, thus my only conclusion is Dr. Gary Chapman is a very smart man and a knows how to communicate better than most.If you feel like your spouse doesn't love you like you think they should, read this book and suggest they do the same."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"This has completely revitalized the way I look at my marriage and the relationships with my children.

Read it and believe it. It will bust your soul wide open."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"This is a must read for any man in a relationship whether you are married or not and especially for those like myself that have been married for 20+ years! Dr. Chapman does an excellent job of writing this from a man's perspective so that we can easily understand the opposite sex and how to figure out their love language. While I would like to think that my wife and don't have that many problems, after 28 years its easy to get in a rut, doing the same things day in and day out and forgetting what it really takes to make a good marriage even stronger. I owe a big thanks to my wife for suggesting that we read the book together, wish we had done it years ago!"},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"This book was a gift to my fiance who absolutely loved it.

We got so much from it that we still use today that this one I bought for a couple we're friends with who got married this summer as a wedding gift."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"I ran across this book by accident, while doing an Amazon search for a different book. It appeared under recommendations, so I decided that I'd buy it. It turned out to be one of the most important decisions of my like. Prior to reading this book, I never gave it so much as a thought that each person in a relationship, be it marriage or otherwise, has their own unique way of looking at the world. If your partner and you are not in tune with what is meaningful to each of you, it will be difficult to sustain a long-term, satisfying relationship. After reading this book, I have a totally new outlook on marriage and relationships in general. It's important to know the love language of your partner because it may be completely different than yours. Effective relationships require not only a mutual respect for one another, but a deeper understanding of what your partner finds important and what they find unimportant. After reading this book, I realized that many of the things that were important to me, weren't to my wife and vice versa. Now that we realize that each of us has their own love language, an already wonderful marriage has become even better. I believe that this book should be required reading for anyone in a serious relationship. It will have a profoundly positive effect on your life and the life of your partner."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"Something you'd probably never think of, something so simple and yet something so important. Who would have thought we all speak love a certain way?! It makes so much sense, and I have been able to realise so many things from past relationships as well as my present one. I can now see how love languages came into play where we had butted heads or ended up in a stalemate with love and intimacy. We both needed different things to feel truly loved, a certain way - this book demystified why things kept getting stuck and why we didn't feel overflowing with love at times - despite the other partner thinking they were being loving.There is no doubt a book like this can save marriages. We aren't born knowing how to be great in a relationship, how to make sure our partners needs are met or how to work them out - what really makes them tick - but this can help. I recommend it to all couples I know."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"Love it. I highly recommend this book for several reasons. It will allow you to understand the different types if love"},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"I truly believe many relationships could be changed for the better if everyone was required to read and complete the assessment in this book. Understanding what speaks loudly helps us to express in a way that is most valuable."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"This is a really fun self help book. It explores the 5 types of needs we all have. It showed me some great ways to really connect better with my wife.

That's what this book is all about and it's so simple!"},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"This book, written in simple terms, describes how you can learn to love your partner in a manner or \\"language\\" that they respond to.

Gives you some insight to who you are as a person!"},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"This is the book I give to every engaged couple I know. It is the wedding shower gift that gets the most talked about. If you are not speaking your partners love language, no matter how much you try, he/she will not really feel the love. This book tells you the love language of your partner and helps you figure out your own. Be generous with our spouse - speak his/her love language often."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"Guys: This was a great book. My girlfriend and I read it on my sister's recommendation. I don't want this to turn some off to the book, but IT'S a FRIGGIN' ROAD MAP!

This will help with that disconnect.Buy the book. Buy two... It'll be the best $15 you ever spend."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"This book is an absolute treasure, a booming, stentorian voice of our age that speaks to maintaining and enriching human relationships. Finally, someone came out and said it, in clever, impactful, simple, and easy-to-remember terms: love is not just about being loved, but about loving in a way that makes another \\"want\\" to love you back."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"I learned about this book because of a radio station I listen to, they were making the 5love languages test.

Recommended by our Christian counselor. Gary Chapman has written \\"Love Language\\" books for all...really good to know information that can be applied for any relationship...parent-child, husband-wife, family. Interesting to learn what my love language is and that of my husband, and what it takes to keep our love tanks full."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"Problems with relationships? well, maybe you don't know your love language. This is a pretty simple, to the point book, good for the beginning of relationships. Kind of Relationships 101 class."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"Upon the advise of my counselor I bought and read this book cover to cover. It's truly amazing to me how informative this was. Not being much of a reader myself I found I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"When it comes to love, I have never experienced true love because I was always selfish. I gave a little and wanted 100% in return or else. I didn't get a great lesson from my parents, nor my siblings, so I learned by trial and error. So this book is the my first easy to understand lesson on how to make it work with my current wife. I really do believe that if you apply your spouses primary love language while also practicing the other 4, your marriage will be fine. The key is to make an honest effort. If you can't make an effort, then counseling may help, or both the book and counseling. Try to look at the positive because there is always one person who will give a negative review, based on one paragraph in the book, rather than the entire book. I consider it a book for the repairing stage of marriage no matter how long you've been married. Obviously some marriages are beyond repairing so drastic measures must be taken. It really makes it easier for me because I can pinpoint one area and do the best I can in that area. Remember that I have to touch the other four languages as well. I hope this helps you in decision to buy the book, but I recommend this book as an engagement gift prior to marriage."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"This book is great in providing an overview of the 5 important key elements in making a marriage work. Out of the five, each person has one that they hold of greatest value. This book helped me and my spouse find it. I just wish the author could have expanded a little more on why one element is more important to one person than to another."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"My boyfriend and I both have our own copies of this book and have read it and discussed together. We first heard about it when married friends utilized it's wisdom to rebuild their marriage. Rather than wait until our relationship is struggling, my boyfriend and I decided it would be smart to be proactive and avoid conflict before it starts. It has already made us stronger as a couple and happier and more secure in our love for each other. Can't say enough good things about it!"},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"I've finished reading all 5 love languages, each being very insightful. The stories shared were very touching as well. To know how to love the person the way they need to be loved not how you think they should be loved.Read this book and it will change your view to a healthy way to love the person your with or the person you will one day be with. I'm single but care to know my own love language and understand love better all together so i found it to be very helpful. Its a good price and well worth it.Enjoy the discovery of what this book can do for you!"},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"Amazing book!

I've seen the concepts this book describes in so many other people I know. I have purchased probably 10 copies so far to give to other friends I think would really benefit from getting it. It's a great book for new couples to read together as well!"},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"Our pastor gave us this book when we got married, but I never read it because talking and communicating is not a problem for me. What I didn't realize is that not everyone communicates in the same way, and, more importantly, that talking to my spouse did not have the same affect on him as it did to me. Who knew we all interpret love differently? I didn't realize how different people really were. Now that I understand my husband's love language, our marriage has never been better!!"},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"I wish I had read this book before my most recent relationship hit the skids. It is so important to understand what language of love you need and what language of love your loved one needs.

What I was able to read I enjoy and can't wait to finish. Reading it from the Kindle is easy and enjoyable-no more thick, heavy books to carry around on vacations!"},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"I received this book from a friend after my &quot;model marriage&quot; had fallen apart.. I was quite impressed with the book and could relate to the many examples of couples trying to review their marriage and find the correct way to express their needs and feelings.. I have always believed that each and everyone of us are merely victims of our own upbringing, and the way you perceive love and marriage has alot to do with the example your parents provided you with.. It amazed me that Mr. Chapman based our needs on five simple gestures.. I asked myself &quot; Could it be that simple!!!&quot;.. And after reading the chapters describing each gesture I came away with a better understanding of why &quot;yes&quot; it can be that simple. The trick is &quot;making the effort&quot; towards your spouse or loved one and &quot;wanting&quot; to put to use the &quot;correct&quot; gesture he or she needs in order to achieve a long, healthly, loving relationship. The only downfall of this book is one simple line in Mr. Chapman's acknowledgments..He mentions his wife of thirty some years and writes &quot; If all wives loved as she does, fewer men would be looking over the fence.&quot; I can't understand how Mr. Chapman can write such a biased line. In one line he seems to put fault primarily on women for the one reason their husbands seek out extramarital affairs...Personally...After I read the book I started questioning myself concerning the demise of my marrige.. I then came to my own conclusion... I feel I could of gone &quot;way beyond my call of duty&quot; and provided my husband with all the right words, gestures, moments etc,that Mr. Chapman claims we all need to survive relationships...but all my effort would not have made a difference to my husband once someone much younger entered his life and gave him what obviously meant more to him than a beautiful wife, beautiful kids, and a great life..and that was an ego.."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"This book is pretty predictable. I can't believe these \\"help books\\" have any value. The author seems very proud of his accomplishments. The problem with help books is they tell you what you already know, or can figure out if you think about it long enough. This is the first and last \\"help book\\" I will buy. This guy is making money off this book and I'm embarrassed I bought it. \\"Five Love Languages\\" is a pat book on how to solve your marriage problems and offers pat solutions that really seem forced and insincere.

There is no easy solution."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"This book is geared toward married folks, but works just as well for the &#34;seriously dating&#34; as well. I had just about given up on my boyfriend of 4 years two winters ago. We had been through my being away at grad school for 3 years and the death of someone very close to him and had somehow forgotten to communicate. This book was HIS idea, not mine. But it worked.

A few friends recommended the book to me now that my husband and I are in our 8th year of marriage. It really helped to explain why he doesn't think to do the things that I need and why my ways for showing love aren't always received as positively as I would hope.

The positive is majorly the way it classified the love needs of people. I liked the guides it had about how to please the people of certain classification. And really that is about it.The writing was very simple. Thus, people whose first or even second language is not English understood the book's contents.

For years they had tried to show love and the other person had not comprehended it at all.

My copies, warn and dog-eared and some of them long lost or &#34;forever borrowed&#34;, I find must be consistently replaced. The search continues, but the book really is just that good. Though written by a Christian, he's not writing just for Christians. Chapman includes this information in his book, but it's worth restating here: this book is for any and all faiths, or none at all, because it's all about people and their relationships.

I use the love languages in every relationship I have! I love to know what someone is and then I know how to best to communicate with them. I think it's something everyone should know about and use! I have actually been asked to hold mini-workshops on these in small church groups. It's been really fun!It took me a long time to realize my true language and now that I know, I don't get as offended when someone does something in their love language, and not mine. I'm more aware of how the other person is sharing love. It really helps to know when they are showing appreciation for you, even in small ways.Best book ever!"},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"Excelente libro, de esos que tienes que tener siempre a la mano para saber c&oacute;mo hablar el lenguaje de amor de tu c&oacute;nyuge."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"This book came across my way in Target one day and I wanted it.It wasn't until that it was recommended to me by one of my very good friends that I had decided to finally leap and buy it.OF course relationship problems at the time -___- 75% his fault 25% mine (You know how some simple minded men are, they act straight foreign on you when you tell them you feel uncomfortable about something then they lie to you and expect you to get over it or just see that your feelings don't matter in this situation when it does because a Monogamist relationship consists of TWO PEOPLE NOT UNO) Yet this book truly explained some things.I've come at easy with some things and he has grasped a better understanding of how unfair he was being.

It will help you understand how each of communications in very different ways."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"There's a lot of truth in this book, and I'd recommend it to anyone, whether they're married, or looking for love. Chapman's 5 love languages make sense, and the stories he uses to introduce them are engaging. This book led to a lot of conversation with my wife, and our marriage is stronger for it. It's a good starting point. There's a Ladies' Mag style \\"test\\" in the back to get a feel for your love language. We cheated and did that first.The only reasons I'd take off a star are:1) Several of the languages are dealt with better elsewhere. As I read a couple of the chapters, I couldn't help but think that some of the languages were dealt with better in How to Make Friends and Influence People, though not in the specific context of marriage.2) Feeling loved and being able to express love are #1 in a marriage, but there's more to making a marriage work, most notably conflict resolution. A book like 10 Great Dates goes much more into nuts and bolts of making a marriage work.If you're looking to make your marriage better, by all means, read this book with your spouse, but by no means stop there!"},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"This book made me stop and think.

Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"The main idea behind this book is that just as people have unique personality preferences, we all have unique preferences for what we find satisfying and motivating when it comes to love. Your love language is the way that you most feel loved and cared for. The problem is most people love how they want to be loved, and that doesn't tend to align with how their partner wants to be loved. So, you have to learn to speak your partner's love language. The author also believes that focusing intently on speaking the love languages will rekindle relationships where people don't even seem to like each other anymore.The relationship expert who wrote the book arranges the book into the five love languages, and provides quizzes to help you determine which language you are:- Words of Affirmation:If this is your love language, you feel most cared for when your partner is open and expressive in telling you how wonderful they think you are, how much they appreciate you, etc.Basically, they find ways to remind you that their world is a better place because you are in it.- Acts of Service:If your partner offering to watch the kids so you can go to the gym (or relieving you of some other task) gets your heart going, then this is your love language.- Affection:This love language is just as it sounds. A warm hug, a kiss, touch, and sexual intimacy make you feel most loved when this is your love language.- Quality Time:This love language is about being together, fully present and engaged in the activity at hand, no matter how trivial.- Gifts:Your partner taking the time to give you a gift can make you feel appreciated.My only critique is that they didn't focus more on understanding and discussing your emotions. For this you and your partner should readEmotional Intelligence 2.0. It did wonders for my husband and I."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"i loved this book (i read the kindle version). a lot of the people who gave it low ratings said it was full of simple common sense. to a point, that's true. but 1) simple is NOT the same as easy and 2) when your marriage is in crisis, common sense goes out the window and you start trying crazy things to solve the problem. or you can't even TRY to solve it at all and it spirals out of control. who can think clearly when there is that much tension at home? its nice to have someone point out some really basic changes to make.my husband and i have COMPLETELY DIFFERENT languages. because of that, we didn't really understand what the other person needed because it was SO DIFFERENT from what each of us needed. we didn't realize how much our actions or lack of actions around a certain \\"language\\" affected the other person. now that i understand, of COURSE it seems like common sense, because it is SO SIMPLE. but i DID need someone else to point it out. thank god for Chapman!this book gives PRODUCTIVE, action-oriented things you can physically DO to help your marriage. most of them take not even 5 minutes a day.its made a HUGE difference for us. i read it about 7 months ago and my house has been a happy and peaceful place ever since (even through some heated arguments and differences of opinion). i hope it helps you as much."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"Dr. Gary Chapman should be nominated for something .....HUGE. This book is a life changer. No, a love changer. Ok, it's both. What hit me right away is it made perfect sense. Then, to top that, by putting the information to actual use, I was able to see real results just like he had written about in the book. After assessing my wife as having the \\"acts of service\\" love language, I decided to test out how she would react. I'm usually up and out the door to work before she gets up. I know she enjoys a cup of coffee in the morning and the sooner the better. So, one morning I set up the coffee pot and put a sticky note on it stating, \\"Just turn me on.\\" She called me at the office and went on and on about how sweet that was and how I scored big points. The guys in the adjoining cubicles were baffled at my side of the conversation. When I told them about the call, and about the book, they thought it worth looking into a bit more.I've given over a dozen copies to friends and family. I just gave one to my nephew who was recently married. I even sent one to a guy I met on a plane who told me he was engaged. Without exception, people come back and tell me how The 5 Love Languages have made such a positive difference in their relationships. This stuff should be taught in school."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"The Five Love Languages takes an approach to relationships and communication that I never would have considered before reading this book. It definitely applies to all relationships, regardless of whether or not you're married. The author, Gary Chapman, asks the reader to examine the ways people in relationships relate to one another. Expressions of love can come in various forms, and I found it so interesting to learn about the ways we can show our love to one another. Not only was I able to better understand my love language, but I also gained insight into my boyfriend's love language as well as new ways to fill his \\"love tank.\\" This book has shed light on so many ways we can love, and as a result my relationship is better than ever!If this book appeals to you, I highly recommend a book by Ariel and Shya Kane entitled,How to Have A Match Made in Heaven: A Transformational Approach to Dating, Relating, and Marriage. Like Chapman, the authors present ways of relating, both with your partner and with yourself, that can have a profound impact on your relationship and overall well-being. The principles in How to Have a Match Made in Heaven have really allowed my relationship with my boyfriend to blossom, and The Five Love Languages has invigorated our partnership in many meaningful ways. I highly recommend you read both books!"},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"My husband and I enjoyed and learned from the first one we read. I thought this version would be geared toward men and he might like it. Imagine our surprise when we opened the book and the stories were the same."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"I think many guys, myself included, are in a box when it comes to loving our wives. I did things my way but neither of us were happy, we stayed together for the kids. One night i decided that the problem must be me. I talked with my wife and told her i was going to change for her. The only thing was that i didn't know how to change. I went to the book store and found this book and read it and it made perfect sense and it was just too easy. I recommend you to read the book but only read it if you are willing to change, if you are not then you are wasting your time and no one can help you. YOU must be ready to give love and accept love."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"Like a couple of other reviewers I had read the original Five Love Languages. It is insightful and has helped me and my wife communicate much more effectively. If you haven't read that, then by all means buy this book. Unfortunately this book has hardly been changed from its original edition and I believe that there should be some sort of disclaimer. Luckily Amazon accepted the return (I purchased the Kindle edition) as I reported this to them within a day of purchase."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"This book explains why - despite somebody's best effort to express his/her love - their partner feels unloved: They speak different \\"love languages\\"! As I read Dr. Chapman's explanation of the five different ways to express and receive love, and that people only \\"get\\" the expression of love, if it is communicated in the language they understand, I began to see why, after an initial phase of being in love, my relationships ended because we lost our connection. We each did express our love with the gestures and words that meant love to us, but they did not meet the emotional needs of the other person. Wow! And this is such an easy fix, once you know what's going on! And I bet it works in every day life, at work, with friends etc as well.Another amazing relationship book I read recently isHow to Have A Match Made in Heaven: A Transformational Approach to Dating, Relating, and Marriageby Ariel and Shya Kane. They cover every stage of relationships through conversations with singles and couples - and you can watch the conversations via a link on-line as well! Their advice is fresh, down to earth, sometimes surprising, sometimes humorous, and always compassionate. And since they work as a couple, both genders' perspectives are reflected, which gives extra depth to their suggestions.Both books are well-written and easy and fun to read. Even though they are organized such that you can easily just read one chapter and continue with the next one whenever you have time again, I just found it difficult to put them down.I highly recommend both books for anyone who wants to find new, effective ways to create your next relationship or transform your existing relationship into the relationship of your dreams."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"I really enjoyed the Five Love Languages by Gary Chapman. The book provides great insights into how people communicate and feel love for one another. It was really cool to look and see what my and my girlfriend's \\"love languages\\" were. It made a huge impact on our relationship and the way we relate! I have been finding new and creative ways to express myself, which I never would have considered before reading this book.Another book that had a great impact on my life and relationship is Ariel and Shya Kane'sHow to Have A Match Made in Heaven: A Transformational Approach to Dating, Relating, and Marriage. It is an inspiring book, which can support you in having an amazing relationship. It includes video clips of the Kanes interacting with the people discussed in the book, which was really helpful, as I could see the ideas expressed in the book come to life.

In this book you will learn how different people express their love and how they feel love. For example.. my mom loves us by doing things for us. Sometimes, I used to get annoyed when she cleaned my room. It not only made me feel guilty but I thought she was invading my privacy. Now I know that this is how she expresses her love. I learned that touch is how I feel loved and show my love. My wife prefers quality time. Hopefully, having this information will help in my future relationships.Book is easy to read.

No problems with the service. Fast delivery. The book has been enjoyable to read. I would recommend it."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"While most of the techniques for improving marital and romantic relationship are things that have been utilized for years, the concept is effective. The concept of love languages makes it very easy to understand for everyone. I like that this book does not make attempts to make certain aspects gender specific much like the famed \\"Men are From Mars, Women are from Venus.\\" This book gives concepts that transend gender and focus on how the other person can fill their partner's needs or \\"love tank\\" and do so while understanding the oh so important \\"why\\". I think this is a very important piece to this book. Not only giving the reader some ideas on how to foster a good solid relationship but also helping them to understand why these actions are important. This is where this book shines for me as opposed to others that just tell you what to do and very little on telling the reader why they should do it.This is a book I will be recommending heavily."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"This is going sound like this is an exaggeration but I assure you it is not.

I would recommend this product to anyone."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"This book describes how to identify and meet each others needs. However I would like to propose something radical and perhaps counterintuitive. Namely, meeting each other's needs is not the path to an extraordinary relationship. Our needs can be many and the fulfilling of our needs (if it is even possible) will not lead to extraordinary love. Instead, let's put our needs aside and seek a spiritual and emotional togetherness. Does that sound vague? Then please read William Martin's \\"The Couple's Tao Te Ching\\". If you want more than incremental improvement in your relationship, read Martin's book. For those who have ears to hear, let them hear."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"It's truly a must read for every relationship. I mean, it's practically that guide that all men wish women came with and all women wish men came with. Instead of wishing you could know how they're feeling, what they're thinking, and what you can do to make him/her see how much you love him/her, you CAN. Understanding how your partner feels loved and having them understand how you feel loved makes all the difference in the world.It's hard to explain but easy to understand once you start reading. The ah-ha moments will blow you away."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"this is a great book for newly weds, however if you're already having trouble in your marriage i suggest seeing a marriage counselor.

The theory is great, but it is impossible to practice, especially if both parties aren't involved. For example after I read this book I thought I knew what my husband's love language was and tried to implement it. Unfortunately, I didn't communicate clearly to him or ask him if my assumptions were correct. I ended up doing more harm than good and we are now split. I think the message should be a lot clearer and it should be noted that just because the book leads you down one path doesn't mean it's the right one for your partner. It might have been more productive if I had shared what I was doing with my husband but we were having difficulty communicating and I should have corrected that first. This book led me to believe that if I just did what he said, everything would be great. Unfortunately that was not the case. In addition, I was somewhat put off by the author's interpretation of Christianity. It doesn't jive with my idea of what Christianity is, in fact it seems somewhat sexist."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"A lot of people think u don't need to learn how to love but I disagree and the divorce rate in the country proves it"},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"Very satisfied with the product and customer service.

It doesn't complicate things or give a lot of very specific things to try. The author presents the concept of the love languages and really leaves it up to the reader to translate the idea into his or her own situation. I like this book for several reasons. First, is that it doesn't make the book too long. Most people could read this in a day or two. Second, I have found that a lot of books get bogged down in the \\"try this, and this and this\\" part of the book and most of it is only going to work for a small subset or the people reading the book. Third, he never lets his ego get the best of him. Many books I have read can tell you all the specifics of a concept or idea but then immediately follow it with, make sure you are working closely with a trained professional. Immediately making the reader think that it is impossible to do any or even part of the concept on their own. This book is really the presentation of a concept and nothing more. That means it is open for your own interpretation and the author leaves it up to you to figure out how to make this work in your marriage.This book is wonderful and I would recommend it to everyone, even if the marriage was stable. Everyone can decide to love their spouse a little better or make some changes to their love strategy."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"Yep, not a bad book.

This book will teach you how to communicate effectively with your partner. In most relationships what we consider loving or as being considerate may not be seen the same way for the other person. What we consider as important may not mean as much to our spouse. We have to learn what's important to them and capatalize on those things.The 5 languages are words of affirmation, acts of service, receiving gifts, quality time and physical touch. Each person has their own preference of things that are important to them. Words of affirmation is basically complimenting your spouse and letting them know what they mean to you. Taking the time to tell your spouse what they mean to your life. Acts of service refers to being available to your spouse and helping them through random acts. Receiving gifts does not have to be a big expensive gift but instead a small gesture that says you were thinking about them. Quality time is making opportunities to spend with your spouse. Physical touch can be hugging, kissing, or hand holding.Learning which one of these is important to your spouse will help your relationship tremendously. I have tried implementing this information and I must say it really helped."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"My wife and I read this book several years ago and we were changed forever by the wisdom presented.

We wrote a passage in each book to them telling them that reading it will help their marriage in so many ways in hopes of them not making some of the mistakes we have made over the past 20 years. We hope this is one of those times they actually listen to us... LOL!! After reading it we both said, \\"why didn't we read this a long time ago it could have saved us from a lot of heartache and resentment towards one another\\"? It's a must read for any meaningful long term relationship whether married or not."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"My husband and I were temp seperated and i got this book and WOW oh WOW opened my eyes and let me see his love language along with mine. We are back together going strong! !100% reccommended!!!"},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"I'm engaged and we have been together now 4 years. We've had our moments and sometimes I could not understand why or how we got there but this book made everything make sense. It has helped me realize what we both need and lack. I can see what we are good at and still need to work on before, we walk down the aisle!thank you so much! Every couple must read thus regardless if you're married or not"},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"I'll be honest, nothing in this book is rocket science. It was,however, a really effective tool for me to organize my thoughts. I really enjoyed most if the book. It was a quick read, it makes sense, and I particularly like the end of chapter questions and tasks. It's never a bad idea to check in on your relationship. This was a great tool to do just that."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"I am currently separated from my husband of 12 years. We have 2 small children and before reading this book, I saw no hope for the two of us, our relationship was toxic and we definitely weren't showing eachother love. After reading this book, I have all the faith in the world that we can successfully love eachother in the language the other person speaks. I never realized how unloved my husband would have felt, but since he is an \\"act of service\\" person and equates love with a clean house, or coffee made for him, his lunch made before he goes to work, etc, he was definitely feeling unloved because none of that was important to me. Now that I know the love languages and have passed the book onto him, I know we will be successful in loving eachother until we're old. If your marriage is failing, I highly recommend this book and if you have a happy marriage, reading this book certainly won't hurt anything, it can only help if you're willing to read and learn from it. It's an easy read, it doesn't read like a text book, there are stories I know I could relate to and now I can't wait to show my husband in HIS language how much I truly love him"},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"Easy to read. Don't agree on all. Basically makes sense. A little preachy, but it could be helpful in understanding how your partner views your loving gestures since we all don't agree on how to show love.Gifts may mean a lot or may mean nothing. Partner may prefer some quality time vs some flowers or jewelry. Makes you reevaluate how you're showing love to others and be more accepting or understanding how your partner is showing love perhaps by doing things for you, acts of service rather than say nice things to you or physical touch. Unfortunately, we may not always understand how others demonstrate their love. This book may help sort it out."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"This book is amazing to help us learn how our couple feels loved.

Not only would this book assist people when they are that verge of breaking up, not communicating, literally feeling no hope, it will also help siblings understand parents and why they loved them the way they did growing up. It makes perfect sense to me that we speak different love languages we are not all cut of of the same mold! What feels loving to one person may feel totally annoying and unloving to another.

We both have claimed to have put in much effort to make the other feel loved yet ironically, both of us have felt under-loved and underappreciated by the other. After reading this book, we have found that we are speaking our own love language to each other but it is not the love language of the other! Our love tanks are not full. After discovering what the others primary and secondary love language is using the assessment test, we have practiced giving heavy daily doses of the primary and sprinkkling in the secondary and little doses of the others. What a difference! It has been a big challenge for us as both our primary language is the other's very least needed! Wow. Talk about having to be intentional. But I can tell you it has been well worth it. The more I hold up to the challenge, the more he feels loved and wants to give me what I need. And vice versa. No wonder this is such a successful book.

Turned out, I stumbled upon the core concept in this book. This book put into words so eloquently all the thoughts I was having and made my have all sorts of further realizations about my marriage. If you read one book on marriage, this is the one it should be. Its short, simple, but powerful. Had I read this book earlier, I could have easily saved my marriage.

I just wish I would have read it sooner.It reminds me alot of buying a gift for someone. You don't buy the gift YOU want, you buy something they will want. That is precisely how we SHOULD show love. Show it in the way that THEY want it. I fell into the same mold as most where I would show love how I wanted it shown back, but like many relationships - he would show love to me the way he wanted . They just happen to be very different. I especially loved the quiz for you and your partner at the end.

After reading this book, it made me realise that a man's way of communicating is so different from that of a woman's, as well as how one was brought up has an effect in it too. By reading, it has made me realise that what's said is not to hurt me but their way of pushing us to do better. It really does hurt sometimes. The book has brought a much deeper understanding in ways to communicate with ones spouse and not making them feel unappreciated. Some scenarios brought forward were like knocking on the doors to my arguments...heheAll in all, I think it is a good counselling and communication therapy read.

I have always had a critical nature and it has had a negative impact over time. I now realize that some of my negative responses towards my husband were because he was not providing what I need to el e loved. Low and behold, turns out I an not providing the love he needs.

This book had provided concrete approaches to learn both you and your spouse's love language."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"After reading this book I started to notice the love languages of all of the people in my life. I can see how connecting with people on their level can only enhance my relationship with them. Wish I read this book years ago.It's a very easy read with many stories of unhappy marriages becoming loving again using the principles in the book. The book, itself, didn't seem to be particularly geared toward woman or men, but I did find certain chapters focussed on one or the other. That was slightly off putting to me. Also, the quiz at the end can be pretty sad for those who haven't had love in their relationship in a long time. The questions are phrased as if the spouse has been doing the loving things.If you're not feeling particularly loved in your relationship this book may give you some insight and may help turn your relationship around. Definitely worth a read."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts","review":"This book changed my views with every relationship: my fiance', my children, and coworkers.

I research love and relationships because the psychology of a long lasting marriage intrigues me. Point is.... My boyfriend and I have a great time filling each other's &#34;tanks&#34; and asking each other what we can do to fill it. I couldn't ask or pray for a better man. And I don't know how I do it but I fill his tank all the time and he is so appreciative! It doesn't even feel like work.

Corresponds to any relationship, not only marriages. I am a single woman, but have learned a lot reading this book."},{"Title":"Amish society","review":"The author is a professor emeritus from Temple University and grew up in an Old-Order Amish family. So in addition to academic credentials, the author has lived the life he describes so well in this book.While this is not a travelogue for those wishing a tour of Amish Country, it would be a very good thing to read before you go to Lancaster, PA or any of the other Amish-settled areas in the US and Canada. Dr. Hostetler describes attitudes to &quot;the English World&quot;, the religious and daily life, and how the Amish merge with their secular neighbors.The book also describes a bit of the struggle the Amish faced in the 60's when they sought permission to have their own schools and end formal educatiion for their children at grade 8. While he says little about it, Hostetler's own life must have been affected by this attitude to what is required in education; he left the community to become a university professor, and subsequently lived with the Hutterites, another religious society in Canada and Europe.This is an enjoyable and realistic book with no sentimentality or gloss. If you want to know more about the Amish, this is definitely the book to read."},{"Title":"Amish society","review":"I purchased the book Amish Society at Lapp's farm in Lancaster County. A book that even the Amish feel is good enough to sell themselves -- worked for me. I didn't read it until I got home from Lancaster Co., PA but it certainly explained a lot of things to me like why I saw cars in the yards of some of the Amish homes, why I saw Amish teenage boys smoking cigarettes, and how Amish sects differ.As a grand-daughter of a related sect of plain people, The Hutterities, it was interesting to see how the Amish were similar to the Hutterites and how they differ. In a way it seemed like voyeurism to discover what the private lives of these very private people are like.This is highly recommended anyone visiting the Amish or wanting ot learn more about them."},{"Title":"Amish society","review":"This is a superb, comprehensive book covering most facets of interest in Amish life. Concentrating on the Old Order Amish, it also provides history and perspective on most of the major Amish schisms, touches on the Mennonites by way of their relationships to the Amish, and gives a good overview of Anabaptist history to boot.The text is very readable and organized by topic. A first time reader would do well to read cover-to-cover, but it can be browsed by chapter once the major terminology and concepts have been learned.Hostetler grew up Amish. The book is a sociological study, written sympathetically. It would be a slight distortion to say it was written from the Amish point of view, but it does succeed in conveying that point of view. It does so accurately with sufficient examples and documentation to be conclusive.Not a coffee table book, not a picture book, this is a readable reference work that you will use again. Quoted and used by many others writing about the Amish, the author is a highly respected authority on the subject."},{"Title":"Amish society","review":"Clearly one of the leading authorities on the Amish, Hostetler's book is a well-researched and well-written look at a group of people struggling to maintain their traditional ways in our modern society. This is an excellent introduction to the Amish."},{"Title":"Amish society","review":"I have many books on the Amish, but this volume is the keystone of the collection. Nothing will advance your understanding of the Amish more than reading this book - nothing. Written by a college professor born into an Old-Order Amish community (the most conservative), the author doesn't just describe the Amish and how they live, but explains why they live as they do and how they think and make decisions about modern life and technology. Along the way he destroys the notion that the Amish are rooted in the past. In fact, they are firmly in the here and now - but deliberately disconnected from the non-Amish world. They use power, motors, machinery, electronics and computers, modern transportation, and more, but in ways that ensure separation.Amish Society gives perspective on how the Amish developed from their Anabaptist roots and where they fit in the modern Anabaptist spectrum. He describes how individuals and families move from one \\"level\\" to another and why. The fine distinctions among Amish communities are fascinating. The author gives an example, using Mifflin County, PA, showing 13 levels of Amish and Anabaptist \\"committment\\" (for lack of a better word). Starting at the center with the Old Order Amish, it proceeds to Old School, Byler Church, Peachey Amish, New Amish, Beachy Amish, Beth-El Mennonite, Holdeman Mennonite, Allensville Mennonite, Locust Grove Mennonite, Bretheren in Christ, Maple Grove Mennonite, and finally Protestant. All are instantly distinguishable to an Amish person by things as subtle as the width of a hat brim.The most unfamiliar content for anyone not familiar with Amish life will be on religious ceremony and practice. Topics such as meetings, hymn singing (absolutely unique), sermons, choosing clergy, weddings, funeral practices, and so on are described in detail you won't find anywhere else.On the personal end, the author describes the kinds of things that an Amish person thinks about, worries about, gives comfort or threatens, and how they view the outside world. In fact, this book is as much a look at the Amish from within as it is an examination of them from without.Again, the best single volume on the Amish by a long shot. Very highly recommended."},{"Title":"Amish society","review":"Growing up near some scattered Amish church districts in Northwestern Pennsylvania and Western New York, I have always been interested in learning more about the Amish going way back to my childhood. Hostetler's book is my first attempt at this and I managed to pick a very good starting point.I disagree with some reviewers about this being a good book to read before a visit to Amish country--its too in-depth and scholarly, I believe, for an average traveler with perhaps only a passing interest in the culture.For someone else, like myself, who wants to learn much more, this book is excellent. Mine was a fourth edition (1993) and the book, with all its revisions, seems just a tad dated at times but this does not detract from the effectiveness of the discussion. Further, it has heightened my interest to learn more, and I will not pass an Amish buggy or household (a monthly occurance) without applying what I learned in this book!"},{"Title":"Amish society","review":"This book is so informative, but at some points it is slow moving. The good thing about the book is that the chapters are divided so you can skip chapters you don't think you would be interested in. It is a great book to buy if you are interested or wanting to learn more about the amish community. It covers everything from funerals to marriage. A great read!"},{"Title":"Amish society","review":"This was the most informative book on the Amish lifestyle that I have found. The author opens up the life of the amish to his readers. It is easy to understand. He takes you through the history, culture and beliefs. I have a deeper respect for the amish and understanding of their customs since purchasing this book. I would recommend this book to anyone who would like a look into a different way of life. This book opened my eyes and my heart to respecting the amish lifestyle and their privacy."},{"Title":"Amish society","review":"After reading Brad Igou's \\"The Amish: In Their Own Words\\" I then came to this book by Hostettler - and am glad I did. This book \\"fills in\\" the portrait of the Amish by providing a very clear, readable, though factual history of the Amish \\"progression\\", if you will. With the Amish existence being much more fragmented than many people think as they lump them all under the term \\"Amish\\", this book really brings about an enlightened understanding of the range of the sects and their relation to each other and \\"the outside World\\" over the course of their development. It also offers the reader a very gracious, very real portrayal of the Amish that, thankfully, dispels many of the traditional misconceptions about these kind and earnest people."},{"Title":"Amish society","review":"I have studied Amish culture and mores for some time out of both interest, admiration, and other motivations. And nowhere have I found a better resource than this book. That the author was himself raised Amish only lends to the credible nature of this book. But more importantly is the concise and thorough manner in which this book presents its truths and dispells rumors and myths. It served to take many of many of the half truths that I had known of the amish and complete them as no other resource has yet done. I heartily recommend this book. And it was a rather easy read, not bogged down by language. I finished it in a few days."},{"Title":"Amish society","review":"I'm interested in the Amish and had to get this book as it was supposed to be \\"the\\" definitive nonfiction book about their way of life. I have absolutely no doubt that if I were reviewing it in 1993 when it was first published, that I would be giving it a 5-star review. However, the last 18 years have made a big difference in the Amish way of life, especially in the Lancaster settlement. There's a lot more dependency on tourism and the outside world for income and less involvement in farming. I hope it will be updated in a new edition that focuses more on the impact these changes are having on the Amish. This is, however, still a worthwhile book to those interested in the Amish."},{"Title":"Amish society","review":"I'm not Amish, nor do I know anyone Amish, but I like reading about other people and they've sparked my curiosity! I've read other books on the Amish but this one is by far the most interesting and well written of all of them so far! Once you start reading it, it's hard to put it down. They take you into the Amish life and you learn so many things about their way of life. There are many pictures! This book is well worth buying!"},{"Title":"Amish society","review":"A very interesting and informative look into the history of the Amish religion. Their trials and tribulations to acheive the simple life. The way they were treated in their native country and the way that they were accepted here in America. Their fight to keep what they believe in as a way of life is awe inspiring. The way they have been treated and they can still be non- conformist and non- violent is a tribute to their religious upbringing. A very good read and an eye opener to these \\"plain people\\"."},{"Title":"Amish society","review":"I purchased this book to educate myself for an upcoming vacation to Pennsylvania Dutch country. I had a basic understanding of Amish beliefs and cultures, but was totally astounded at the differences between the sects. Mr. Hostetler provides first-hand knowledge that no one else has in any other book I've read pertaining to the Amish & Mennonites."},{"Title":"Amish society","review":"excellent concise book on the mennonite/amish culture..easily understandable and very readable..since the author was once amish he is able to provide personal examples...."},{"Title":"Amish society","review":"I grew up not far from Amish and Mennonite communities, where Amish carriages were a common sight. A farmer who was my Dad's best friend had his dairy barn built by the Amish. Many of my own ancestors were Pennsylvania Dutch, though they were French Huguenots who had escaped to Switzerland and Alsatian Lutherans instead of Amish and Mennonites. There were Mennonite girls with their white muslin caps on my school bus. Not long before I was born people still spoke Pennsylvania Dutch just a mile from where I grew up. Our family used Pennsylvania Dutch expressions like \\"outen the lights\\" and my mother cooked scrapple and called cottage cheese \\"smearcase\\".This books describes the Amish as I imagined them--hardworking, religious, and keeping to themselves. This book tells of how the Amish began in Alsace, and how they came to be different and remain different. I was interested to learn that many Amish do not wear clothes with buttons because in the 17th and 18th centuries buttons were primarily found as part of military uniforms, so naturally the Amish would not want any part of that. The author speaks of the Amish way as one deeply rooted in symbolism--a symbolism that informs each Amish man and woman that he is separate from the outside world. It would seem that Amish clothes and work practices define them as certainly as their language and religion."},{"Title":"Amish society","review":"Very informative book.

Klemp has never catered to the slothful but to those who are willing to keep a middle of the night dream journal, and try his ideas about soul travel with an open mind and joyous heart. For myself, I've been keeping the dream journal and trying the soul travel exercises and I am happy with my decision to buy this book. I've been buying and reading his books for years and I've always felt satisfied and gently pushed to go further in life both professionally and spiritually.

Why do so many people say one thing and do another? Why the apparent injustices? Why the big differences in economic and educational opportunities, intelligence, health, and talents among humans?These and more questions are answered in Past Lives, Dreams, and Soul Travel by Harold Klemp. It contains extraordinary stories of ordinary people, tools, techniques, and insights from a high spiritual vantage point.

I was a little taken aback by the author's point-of-view. Not a very good read..."},{"Title":"Past Lives, Dreams, and Soul Travel","review":"This book is mainly filler. If you have ever read any other book by this author (Harold Klemp) you need not purchase this book. Many stories are even indicated as coming from other Eckankar books. There is also a lot dogma which is designed to influence the reader through various means of conscious and unconscious methods such as: repitition, dreams, substitution, and audio &amp; visual suggestion and self-hyptnosis. Early on the concept of the &quot;Mahanta&quot; is presented but is not fully explained. The Mahanta is greater than Jesus! The Mahanta is greater than God! Harold Klemp's titles are: Mahanta, the Living Eck Master, the Outer Master, the Inner Master, the Dream Master, and the Load of Hosts (to name just a few). In Eckankar all other religions are looked down upon and whose &quot;GOD&quot; is no higher than the 4th Plane or heaven. The Mahantaship begins on the 14th Plane! Even High Initiates in Eckankar begin at the 5th Plane which is higher than the &quot;GOD&quot; of all of the religions on earth or anywhere! However, Eckankar will falsely use the word &quot;God&quot; when talking to the &quot;public&quot; to mislead, fit in, and not scare off any potential members. Basically, the book is intended to continue the false creation of Paul Twitchell by making people dependent on someone (the Mahanta) other than their own Higher Self, or God-Soul. Self-Mastery is never a possibility although the author mentions spiritual freedom as a goal for each Soul. It is like a carrot that is dangled in fron of the seeker, but is always out of reach. This book is a big disappointment!"},{"Title":"Past Lives, Dreams, and Soul Travel","review":"I started reading the book very eagerly. But I found it soon very boring.

Personally the most redeeming part I found in this book was Timerman's personal methods to cope with the traumatic torture, and, most applicable to myself, an existence without tenderness and love. His words ring loud and true, his advice is sound, sound, sound."},{"Title":"Prisoner Without a Name, Cell Without a Number","review":"Jacobo Timerman has written a gripping and terrifying account of his experiences at the mercy of Argentina's Peronist regime of the late 70's. A well respected, professional journalist in Buenos Aires, he was editor of the major newspaper La Opini&oacute;n until he was kidnapped by the military for publishing articles critical of their terrorist tactics. He details how as a political prisoner, and more signifigantly as a Jew, he was held and tortured by a military carried away by their own delusions and rationalizations of violence - and by their virulent anti-semitism. Timerman displays a penetrating insight into the mindset of his captors and of a society that tried to ignore what was happening. A must read."},{"Title":"Prisoner Without a Name, Cell Without a Number","review":"I won't give a synopsis of the book b/c everyone else has already done that for you. What I can say about this book is that it is an impetus. After you read it, you'll most likely be hungry for more information about this brutal time in a seemingly well-developed country. Questions to consider: Why the silence of the press, with the exception of Timerman's newspaper 'La Opinion' and the 'B.A. Herald?' How could someone treated so horribly come out of it okay? Why did this happen after Pinochet's regime and the Nazi regime? This is post WWII, so why? Where was the rest of the world? The book is splendid, the first chapter gut-wrenching and beautiful. You will love it as much as Elie Wiesel's 'Night.'"},{"Title":"Prisoner Without a Name, Cell Without a Number","review":"One of the most harrowing books I've ever read. An amazing entreaty against violence of both the left and the right, and a heartbreaking analysis of contemporary anti-Semitism.

So much goes under the radar and this book exposes some real evil. A must read, but also pretty hard to take."},{"Title":"Prisoner Without a Name, Cell Without a Number","review":"Journalist Jacobo Timerman (1923-1999) makes a powerful statement about life as a political prisoner. Timerman was publisher of LA OPINION, a centrist-liberal newspaper when Argentina's military took power in a 1976 coup amidst violent instability. The governing militarists soon launched their National Reorganization Process (or \\"dirty war\\") to stabilize the nation by ridding Argentina of leftists, young activists, and other undesireables. Timerman dared publish stories opposing how the military was grabbing people who then disappeared, an action that led to his own arrest in early 1977. Isolated in a tiny cell, Timerman was regularly blindfolded, interrogated, and tortured with an electronic cattle prod. Adding to his dilema, Timerman was Jewish in a nation hardly devoid of military Anti-Semitism. Timerman describes learning to think and dream of almost nothing as a means of surviving his predicament. Ironically, a smuggled letter from his wife on their anniversary added to his torment by reminding him of family and freedom. Actually, Timerman was somewhat lucky; unlike most detainees he wasn't killed, but instead transferred to house arrest and then deported to Israel - saved perhaps by the efforts of diplomats. Writing these pages from exile in 1981, Timerman claimed he was unable to properly describe the physical and mental horror of his experience - although readers should get the point. Additionally, Timerman provides solid political analysis, while opposing violence, corruption, and Anti-Semitism. He also attacks police states of both the right and the left - a nice change from the many that find fault with one but not the other. All this in just 164 moving pages.Timerman returned to Argentina in 1984 after civilian rule was re-established, and at this writing his son serves as that nation's foreign minister. Argentina recently converted several detention/torture centers into museums honoring the thousands of arrestees that vanished during the dirty war - while visiting one we met a guide who had been an infant when his father was arrested by the military in 1976 and vanished. Even today some mothers and grandmothers of the disappeared still protest by the Presidential Palace in Buenos Aires.Readers might also enjoy THE FIXER, a similar, fictional look at wrongful imprisonment based on the case of Mendil Belis."},{"Title":"Prisoner Without a Name, Cell Without a Number","review":"Este libro es un resumen de un pais de tristeza.

As a journalist, Timerman often gets caught up in the socio-political environment rather than the experience of torture and prison. This is supposed to be a memoir, not a political commentary on the situation in Argentina. I appreciated what Timerman wrote, but in all, I found the writing to be rather dry."},{"Title":"Prisoner Without a Name, Cell Without a Number","review":"Jacobo Timerman's excruciating tale of false imprisonment at the hands of Argentina's totalitarian regime. He describes his two year imprisonment and the torture that he endures at the hand of his captors. Obviously a very tough topic to describe, this is not always an easy book to read. His story of perseverance and will to overcome his circunstances are truly inspiring. However I was not enamored with the amount of political commentary, and i think that takes away from his message."},{"Title":"Prisoner Without a Name, Cell Without a Number","review":"I read this book, here in Brazil, about 20 years ago.This book was writen by an argetinian and jew, about thirty years ago.This book is against Argetina's government, in late 1970 decade.This book isn't a communist's book, but a book against torture and other bad things.The main problem of this book is that we aren't in 1970 decade.Argentina's processo is over since 1983 and we must remember that in Argentina, there was less than 0.05% of murders that were did in \\"socialists paradises\\" such as China or former USSR."},{"Title":"Down The Emperor's Road With Hiroshige","review":"This little book provided me with the first full set of copies of Hiroshige's ukiyo-e prints of the 53 stations of the Tokaido which I had come across other than in museums. The print reproductions selected for inclusion are a less common set than usually seen, and so have added interest. Unfortunately the small format of the book means that the illustrations, of which only half are in colour, are small, only about 125 mm by 75 mm. The black and white ones are only about 50 by 30. Buy this book if you can find it. What it will do for you is stimulate your appetite and make you search for a larger format book with bigger and clearer images, and until you do find such a book, at least you have this one. Although it does not contain a full set of the Tokaido prints, &quot;Hiroshige&quot; by Matthi Forrer is an excellent next stage in your love of works by Hiroshige."},{"Title":"Tragedy at Honda","review":"Tragedy at Honda brings out the cruel facts of one of the little known tragedy where a navigational error and &#34;blindly following the leader&#34; led to the loss of many brave sailors near Point Conception on the California coast."},{"Title":"Vietnam (Enchantment of the World, Second)","review":"Vietnam: Enchantment of the World covers a variety of aspects of life in Vietnam in a way that is engaging and easy to read.

This latest essay collection is no exception. Califia takes on larger social issues, from NAMBLA to nonoxynol-9, but he also delves into the personal, including his mother's death from breast cancer and his own transition from female to male. Best of all, he writes candidly about the trials and joys of co-fathering his toddler son. The right-wingers will be foaming at the mouth over this one. Highly recommended"},{"Title":"Speaking Sex to Power: The Politics of Queer Sex","review":"Although much of the text is about Mr. Califia's personal journey from female to male his writing in this text is inclusive and will not alienate his lesbian audience, he certainly appears to respect the fact that the lesbian community is where he had his start as a very well received author. His candor about his own sexual idenity, sexuality, and gender identity will prove very helpful to anyone who is struggling and find him or herself at whatever place on the gender spectrum. As always Califia is affirming in respect to people's identities while remaining subversive and loud. This text is intellectual without overwhelming the audience with academic rhetoric which is often abundant and excessive in queer theory."},{"Title":"The Mother of All Laughter: Sarah and the Genesis of Comedy","review":"When C. S. Lewis advised writers to translate their theology into the vernacular, I realized that the common tongue of the early twentieth century was humor. Thus, with appropriate chutzpah and reckless abandon, I sought to inquire what doctrines like Creation, the Fall, Incarnation, Redemption and Community might contribute to our understanding of laughter. And I found the biblical character of Sarah, a smart and savvy woman, to be the saint who could teach me. At 90 she gave birth to Isaac, whose name in Hebrew means \\"laughter,\\" thus making her the Mother of all Laughter. I took five verses from Genesis that deal with Sarah and laughter and squeezed them until they blessed me with humorous insights. (The editors did leave out several jokes, one of them being adapted from an old Catskills' line: Abraham: \\"Sarah, we've waited so long, that God has promised us super sex tonight!\\" Sarah: \\"At your age, take the soup.\\") The work argues for an understanding of laughter as based in incongruity (and the reviewer who suggested the Armstrong story was told as fact missed my comic tone--it is a tall tale told as authentic report--which makes it funnier to me.), the body (yes, God made sex, even if He didn't name the parts) and community. Finally, the book can be used with flannel graph cutouts of Abraham and Sarah in various positions of laughing."},{"Title":"The Mother of All Laughter: Sarah and the Genesis of Comedy","review":"Bought this book as a gift for my wife, but I ended up reading it first.

It is the true story of a ride the author made with 2 horses from Argentina to the United States through the Andes and Central America from 1925 to 1928. It is easy to read and very entertaining."},{"Title":"Tschiffely's ride: Ten thousand miles in the saddle from southern cross to pole star","review":"A friend of mine from Paraguay recommended this book to me, and I have thanked him profusely since having completed it. Tschiffely achieves two things in writing this diary. First, he gives a fascinating account of what life was like on the trail through the Americas in the 1920's, an era of transition from the horse to the automobile, from undiscovered lands to thoroughly mapped and surveyed developments, from untouched communities to homogenized modernity. Second, he writes before the age of political correctness and his observations, though not mean-spirited, are totally honest and telling. This is no dreamy-eyed travelogue.The book is not about horses per se, but if you have any affinity for equestrianism you will not be disappointed. The quiet bond that forms between Tschiffely and his two horses is touching, and his love of animals in general is not rooted in slobbering sentimentalism, but in respect and understanding of the magnificent creatures which contribute so much to our lives.This book is for those who want to be transported to another world and gain insight into what we have lost as a culture, both good and bad. Truly this story needs to be rediscovered!"},{"Title":"Tschiffely's ride: Ten thousand miles in the saddle from southern cross to pole star","review":"Since most Americans know very little about Latin American history and culture, I think the book holds merit for all readers.

He was very famous in his time, meeting with President Coolidge, articles and speeches in National Geographic, newspapers, etc.. every country along his path gave him golden receptions. I'm sure most peoples grandparents remember him (although he is probably mostly forgotten today!). Parts of this book were printed in National Geographic Magazine (in the 1930s).Written in a straight forward but very readable and enjoyable style, it is one adventure after the next, each page is literally a new encounter. It can be an exhausting read at times. One admires Tschiffely's physical strength and morally strong character (not withstanding the opium den experiment). As well as his affection, bond and care for his horses and all living creatures (this is also a horse lovers tale).Latin America in the 1930s was a time when cars, electricity, TV's and radio, phones, etc.. existed only in isolated pockets, when Spanish conquistador history still lay heavy over the land. Brilliant first person encounters and observations of the individuals and cultures that history books would not as well convey, and that are now lost to modernity. It is also interesting how nearly impossible it was to travel north/south in Latin America even just 70 years ago due to geography (by comparison travel by horse east-west across America would be a less interesting story being done so often).Overall a very good book. At times things seems to repeat (another town, another fiesta) and the authors ability to keep things new escapes him toward the end (perhaps due to his malaria) so it starts to feel like a journal, but that is a minor quibble for a classic travel adventure book."},{"Title":"Tschiffely's ride: Ten thousand miles in the saddle from southern cross to pole star","review":"Aime Tschiffley, the most resiliant and capable of Buenos Aires' schoolmasters, wrote this truly astonishing story of his ride from Argentina to Washington, DC. South and Central America before WWII was still in many ways as the old Spanish had left it - some of it deliciously civilized, much of it as wild as can be imagined. With his two remarkable Creole horses, Mancha and Gato, Tschiffley journeys through a world that no longer exists today and seems remote and ancient to the modern reader. Tschiffley's prose is somewhat matter-of-fact, but in some ways this serves to emphasise the very strangeness of the countryside and its peoples, and underscores the author's own courage. Tshiffley is a product of his times, and some of his sentiments are out of place today, but this too places this book within a time and place long past. From &quot;Don Roberto's&quot; oddly moving introduction to journey's end in the United States, one grows to admire Tschiffley and love his horses, the two friends Mancha and Gato."},{"Title":"Tschiffely's ride: Ten thousand miles in the saddle from southern cross to pole star","review":"Wow.

Despite, or maybe because of, the simple matter-of-fact writing style this tale of an amazing, yet true, journey held my interest and I enjoyed every page.The book is basically a diary of Tschiffely's ride from inception to end, he writes simply of the trails taken, the hardships and joys and the people he met along the way. This is a tale of a bygone era when great adventures were undertaken without enormous budgets or near hysterical live reportage. Pages describe what must have been terrifying events with endearing understatement and the sort of modesty that most modern day heros cannot muster.Not only does this book put you into a different time and place but it encourages you to consider the possibilities within yourself."},{"Title":"Tschiffely's ride: Ten thousand miles in the saddle from southern cross to pole star","review":"It is 1925. A man and two horses set out to travel from Buenos Aires to Washington, D.C. -- 10,000 miles. It takes them over two years. This is the tale of their trek. TSCHIFFELY'S RIDE supposedly is one of the classics of travel writing. It got that reputation in an earlier generation but, given the passage of time and changes in styles and tastes, I don't think it still deserves such status.A.F. Tschiffely, of Swiss background, had taught school in Buenos Aires for nine years when he got the idea to be an adventurer/travel writer. For his first expedition, he would ride from Buenos Aires to Washington, D.C. It ended up being an arduous trip, more demanding both physically and mentally than most would be up to. Tschiffely proved himself an exceptionally rugged traveler. But even more exceptional, more rugged, perhaps even more intelligent, were his two horses - Mancha and Gato - which were Griolla (\\"creole\\") horses that had been born wild on the plains of Patagonia. They were 18 and 16 years of age at the start of the trek; they endured with barely an equine shrug 10,000 miles over deserts and Andes passes as high as 16,000 feet, through jungles and torrential rains, and across raging rivers; and they eventually lived to the ages of 40 and 35.TSCHIFFELY'S RIDE contains many tales of adventure and exotica: vampire bats, opium dens, bubonic plague, shrunken heads, niguas (parasites that can eventually deform feet so they resemble cauliflowers), cockfights, iguana stew, malaria, and revolutions. As a travelogue of sorts, it also is a picture of those parts of Latin America (Argentina, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Panama, Costa Rica, San Salvador, Guatemala, and Mexico) through which Tschiffely rode as they were in the mid-1920's. A small bonus is a set of photographs Tschiffely took en route. (A somewhat bigger bonus would have been an accurate map of Tschiffely's route in lieu of the fancified \\"artistic\\" and next-to-worthless map actually included.)The problem with the book is its rather old-fashioned, sentimental style, which far too often lapses into the clich&eacute;d and trite. Like many of his time, Tschiffely is fascinated with racial and national \\"types\\" and characteristics, and his observations along these lines frequently are both anachronistic and uncomfortable. For example, with regard to the Indians he encountered in the United States, he writes, \\"if I had not been told they were such, I would have taken them for Mexican labourers, and instead of being able to cast glances at the Hiawatha beauties of my dreams, I found the Indian women dressed like whites, and the majority of them were fat and ugly.\\" However, he generally is of \\"liberal\\" sentiment for his times, as demonstrated in this example: \\"White man has but few morals to teach the Indian, and it is superfluous for me to go into details why I think so. Suffice it to mention war, murder, commerce, prostitution, refined vice and hypocrisy, things that are beyond the range of understanding of any pure Indian when considered on the scale we know them.\\"I sense that nowadays TSCHIFFELY'S RIDE would be appreciated most by horse-lovers and those with an anthropological or historical interest in Latin America of the 1920's. For others, the outmoded style and the dross of yesteryear probably would offset the periodic vignettes of adventure."},{"Title":"Tschiffely's ride: Ten thousand miles in the saddle from southern cross to pole star","review":"This is a most incredible story about Aime Tschiffley and his 2 criollo horse, Mancha and Gato, who in 1925, walked/rode from Argentina all the way to Washington, DC. The journey carried them 10,000 miles in 2-1/2 years across the most inhospitable and remote regions one can imagine. They endured heat and cold, sickness and hunger, climbed the Andes and walked the depths of the rain forests. In the end, they were welcomed as heros everywhere they went. Tschiffley even met with the President in the oval office and spoke before the National Geographic Society. The most heart-warming part of this improbable tale is the bond between man and horse. It's sad at times, as when Mancha was struck by a car, and comedic at times, as when Mancha bucked his way through an award presentation ceremony in a Mexico City bullring. The last pages of the book are guaranteed to put a lump in your throat. What a great read, even if it was published in 1933!"},{"Title":"Tschiffely's ride: Ten thousand miles in the saddle from southern cross to pole star","review":"This man was amazing. The hardships he suffered on his trip, always putting his horses first, made me really like this man.His insights into indian life at the time were very interesting. His descriptions of the cities and scenery he went through were fascinating especially as I have visited them in current times and know how they look today. He was astonishingly brave to attempt such a trip and I was so upset when I read what a car driver did to him while crossing Texas.I was sorry to finish reading the book and even shed a little tear at the end when he accomplished his goal. Even though it was written in 1925, it still was very readable and the author made his trip come alive for me."},{"Title":"Tschiffely's ride: Ten thousand miles in the saddle from southern cross to pole star","review":"Once you start, you won't be able to put it down! And, you will get out your maps as well as study the history of the countries during the time of his amazing ride in 1925. It was disturbing to read that towards the end of his ride in the U.S. that drivers (even the few on the road at that time) purposely ran into him and his horses. Now I want to read his journey through Patagonia next."},{"Title":"La Nuit Bengali","review":"i was touched by discription of the Alain's love for Maitreyi.if a person can write so much about love,how much love he must be having in his heart!this book is my passion,i am translating this book in to gujrati."},{"Title":"The Call of the Wild","review":"I have to admit that I have not really given Jack London his proper due up to now. Perhaps it is because I don't by my nature like outdoor adventure type stories, or perhaps it is because I associate White Fang and &quot;To Build a Fire&quot; with my youth. The fact is that Jack London is a tremendously talented writer. His understanding of the basics of life matches his great knowledge of the snow-enshrouded world of the upper latitudes. The Call of the Wild, despite its relative brevity and the fact that it is (at least on its surface) a dog's story, contains as much truth and reality of man's own struggles as that which can be sifted from the life's work of many other respected authors. The story he tells is starkly real; as such, it is not pretty, and it is not elevating. As an animal lover, I found parts of this story heartbreaking: Buck's removal from the civilized Southland in which he reigned supreme among his animal kindred to the brutal cold and even more brutal machinations of hard, weathered men who literally beat him and whipped him full of lashes is supremely sad and bothersome. Even more sad are the stories of the dogs that fill the sled's traces around him. Poor good-spirited Curly never has a chance, while Dave's story is made the more unbearable by his brave, undying spirit. Even the harsh taskmaster Spitz has to be pitied, despite his harsh nature, for the reader knows full well that this harsh nature was forced upon him by man and his thirst for gold. Buck's travails are long and hard, but the nobility of his spirit makes of him a hero--this despite the fact that his primitive animal instincts and urges continually come to dominate him, pushing away the memory and reality of his younger, softer days among civilized man. Buck not only conquers all--the weather, the harshness of the men who harness his powers in turn, the other dogs and wolves he comes into contact with--he thrives. The redemption he seems to gain with the fortunate encounter with John Thornton is also dashed in the end, after which Buck finally gives in fully to &quot;the call of the wild&quot; and becomes a creature of nature only. While this is a sad ending of sorts, one also feels joy and satisfaction at Buck's refusal to surrender to nature's harsh trials and his ability to find his own kind of happiness in the transplanted world in which he was placed. This isn't a story to read when you are depressed. London's writing is beautiful, poignant, and powerful, but it is also somber, sometimes morose, infinitely real, and at times gut-wrenching and heartbreaking.The other stories are also powerful tales of survival (or demise) in the face of nature's harshness. I feel I am not alone in saying that I cannot recall most of the stories I had to read in school in my younger years but I distinctly recall &quot;To Build a Fire.&quot; London's real, visceral language and description is hard to forget, as is the human pride and stupidity that characterizes the protagonist--London seems to be saying that we must respect and understand nature in order to survive and prosper. The protagonist's demise is more comical than tragic because of his lack of understanding and appreciation for the harsh realities of his environment. All of the stories bear the same general themes as the two I have mentioned. In each, man or beast is forced to battle against nature; survival is largely determined by each one's willingness or freedom to recede into primitiveness and let the blood of his ancestors rise up within his veins. Those who refuse to give in to their lowest instincts and who do not truly respect nature do not survive. I feel that London sometimes went a little overboard in &quot;The Call of the Wild&quot; when describing Buck's visions and instinctual memories of his ancestors among the first men, but his writing certainly remains compelling and beautiful, an important reminder to those of us today who are soft and take nature for granted that nature must be respected and that even her harshest realities are in some ways beautiful and noble, and that the law of survival applies just as much to us as it does to the beasts of the field."},{"Title":"The Call of the Wild","review":"A classic work of literature for all times! Your 5th grader will love, your 10th grader will love it, you will love it! A must read."},{"Title":"The Call of the Wild","review":"This is the first Jack London I have ever read, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. The Call of the Wild has so much depth and intelligence to the writing that I can imagine books being written about it, and at the same time it's written in such a way that many elementary school children should be able to understand it (if standards are still up where they were when I was that age).The various stories after The Call of the Wild are also interesting. They are all similarly themed, with the protagonist suffering through the tortures of the cold wilderness, freezing and starving to death, but each is unique, and Jack London's imagination is never in question to the reader. Overall, excellent writing."},{"Title":"The Call of the Wild","review":"Long before TV, the written word was the wellstone of many political movements. This is as true in America as it is in Europe, and many modern American books are testament to this. Upton Sinclair's Jungle started the food safety movement, Nader's Unsafe at any Speed brought public and Congress's attention to car safety, and the Grapes of Wrath put white poverty into the attention of the mainstream media. This book, more than any other single work of American literature, can be argued as giving birth to the animal-rights movement; a very unique feature of American society as animals have almost no rights everywhere else in the world. This story itself is short and accessible to most elementary school students. What it does is create a parallel between human suffering and the suffering of animals; and in doing so, it puts a human face on animals. As such, it deserves to be on any list of great works of English literature, and as part of any middle school curriculum."},{"Title":"The Call of the Wild","review":"I read three short stories from the book, &quot;The Call of the Wild and Selected Stories&quot;, by Jack London. These stories include \\"To Build a Fire\\", \\"To the Man on Trail,\\", and \\"Diable the Dog.\\" I recommend all three of these short stories to people who like descriptive short stories with exciting scenes and sad endings.The story \\"To Build a Fire\\" is about a man who is heading up to camp, which is twelve hours away in seventy-five-degree below zero weather. This story is about man versus the cold, frigid, abilities of Mother Nature. The theme of this story seems to be about how challenging nature can be to humanity.The second story, \\"To the Man on Trail,\\" is about a band of men from many different lands celebrating Christmas when an under cover thief shows up. This is an exciting story that confuses the reader at times because you can't tell if he is good or bad until the end. The theme of this story is about man versus society. It makes one think that you can't judge a book by its cover.The last story of the three, written by Jack London, is called \\"Diable - A Dog.\\" This is about an evil dog who is owned by an evil owner. His owner beat him so much that he started to take revenge against his owner by trying to kill him. This story is a great example of the saying, \\"You reap what you sow.\\" This story seems to be about the conflict of man versus nature, as well as man versus himself, since the dog had a natural evil temperament, which was worsened by the beatings he received from the man. Both of these factors created evil in this dog, which in the end defeated the man.I had mixed feelings about these stories because I normally prefer science fiction novels. I also didn't like how the main character in two of the three short stories always perished. However, what I really like in the stories was the author's way of describing his characters and their conflicts. I t made me feel like I was a part of the story. I recommend these stories to anyone who enjoys rich, detailed, stories with exciting scenes.."},{"Title":"The Call of the Wild","review":"Jack London is still the most widely read American author in the whole world.

The author did an OK job on making it bearable for girls, yet I would definitely classify this as a &quot;boy book.&quot; I found it impossible to enjoy, although guys may like it. I don't like reading about animals. I like reading about people, and how they react to different situations, a position no animal could fulfil.

Definitely worth the purchase. A definite re-read book for your library."},{"Title":"The Third Heiress","review":"I have never heard of Brenda Joyce but once I read an exerpt of this book, I was hooked. Once I started reading, I was unable to put the book down. Her main characters, Jill and Alex, were definitely an intriguing pair who both expressed sexual attraction and emotions along with possible deceptive qualities. You never knew what would happen next. But once you did, it was shocking and unpredictable. I highly recommend this book to whom ever loves romantic suspenses with mysterious endings."},{"Title":"The Third Heiress","review":"Good mystery,difficult to relate to values of the heroin.Books by Brenda Joyce are always a good choice. One of my favorite authors."},{"Title":"The Third Heiress","review":"If you are one of those who use the phrase, \\"being as\\" instead of \\"since,\\" you will love this book.If you like a heroine who says, \\"I'm sorry\\" every couple of minutes to the family she is tearing apart and then keeps on going, then you will love this book.If you like a heroine who crys constantly, then you will love this book. Oh, and \\"the other woman\\" cries all the time, too. Another reason to love this book.If you like a heroine to be a ballerina/broadway dancer who never practices, then you will love this book.If you like a family that has no good reason to be torn apart in the first place because the author tells us they run a business empire with accompanying power and therefore you know they are not stupid and should have solved this problem without all the subterfuge, then you will love this book.And so on...The story line had potential in my opinion, but the heroine is \\"Miss Emotionality\\" and the family characterizations are fairly lifeless. I did finish it, but I skipped a lot which is rare for me as I am the type who read all the cereal boxes and the fine print on the credit card contract."},{"Title":"The Third Heiress","review":"The heroine, Jill, was so NOT a heroine. She frustrated me at every turn. Halfway through the book my frustrations compelled me to read the reviews to find out what I had gotten into. By doing so, I saved myself from more hours of torture. I could not and did not finish the book. Just read the reviews and you will find that, the ending is as unsatisfactory as the beginning, answers will not be given, justice is a foreign word, and, in Jill, stupidity reigns.I heard Brenda Joyce is a good author. My friend gave me about 6 of her books. This was the first one I picked up. I might give her another chance, but I would rather re-read my entire \\"In Death\\" series by J.D. Robb, to get the bad taste of 3H out of my head, and then I'll reconsider Brenda Joyce."},{"Title":"The Third Heiress","review":"This was the first time I had read a book written by Brenda Joyce. I was attracted to it after I read a brief description of it in a genealogy magazine.I found it to be a book that once I started to read, it was difficult to put down. The charecters struck me as well developed and interesting. T he plot took on a bit of a somewhere in time aspect but I found it not to be a problem. I don't know if this is similar to other works by Ms. Joyce but it does have me interested in her writing now.In all I found this to be a good introduction to Ms. Joyce and I am looking forward to reading more of her books."},{"Title":"The Third Heiress","review":"The story begins with Jill Gallager's fianc&eacute; Hal dying in her arms and saying \\"I love you Kate.\\" That was the part that caught me, that was the part that made me want to read it. Then Jill goes to England to bring Hal's body to his aristocratic family. She stays with the family and one night in Hal's room she finds a picture of two women from the 1900's on Hal's nightstand. She then goes on a rampage trying to find Kate Gallager (one of the women in the photo) because she's sure Kate is one of her ancestors. Along the way she makes friends with Hal's cousin Alex, they are attracted to each other and soon hop into bed with each other. The sex scenes are \\"too detailed\\" (I was just more in the mood for romantic words;)) and not very romantic or loving. I didn't like the idea of Jill getting it on with Alex so fast after her so called beloved Hal died. And then it turns out that Hal had some strange obsessions... The plot is interesting, sometimes hard to believe (but hey it's only fiction!) Joyce's characters are dense and rather unpleasant. I think she could have made things so much more creative and developed better characters with more emotions. The book isn't unbearable though! I give it C :)"},{"Title":"The Third Heiress","review":"As a romance reader, I typically favor the lovey-dovey style with lots of strong heroes and spunky heroines. This book is not a typical romance but I couldn't put it down! I'll agree with other reviewers that Jill (the main character) is very emotionally distraught and that if sex scenes are your thing, then you won't get your kicks here. Yet, it only makes sense that Jill would be emotional (personally, I'm a little tired of books where the heorine has undergone some terrible misfortune only to completely recover two days later) and slow to trust anyone in the hostile Sheldon family. The male lead, Alex, is fascinating, and the question is, can Jill trust him? As she takes off down the road to investigate the mysterious disappearance of an American heiress named Kate (who is somehow tied to her dead fiancee even though she lived at the turn of the century), it quickly becomes apparent that someone doesn't want Jill to find the truth. This book is mystery, romance, suspense, and a hint of ghost story all in one. It's a good read, and the romance that develops is realistic yet exciting. Kudos to Brenda Joyce- The Third Heiress is a strong piece of work!"},{"Title":"The Third Heiress","review":"I've never read any Brenda Joyce books and I'm glad because I don't like romance novels.However I could not put this book down.It will keep you'r interest.Great job Brenda.Keep up the good job.And keep adding new fans."},{"Title":"The Third Heiress","review":"Jill Gallagher's boyfriend was killed in a tragic accident, now she must bring his body home to his family in England.

For anyone who read &quot;Promise of the Rose&quot;, you know what I am talking about. I love all types of romance ---comtemp. hist. funny. suspense, ect...Unfortunately, this book, &quot;The third Heiress&quot; did not live up to the hype. I felt no emotional involvement with the characters at all. There was nothing about Jill for me to want to read about! The mystery was lacking and I did not care for the whole &quot;Who am I&quot; plot line. It was played...so played! I know Brenda Joyce has written five star books before, I have read them. This book fell short. I hope she can lure me back with something better in the future."},{"Title":"The Third Heiress","review":"I picked up &quot;The Third Heiress&quot; because I have always enjoyed Brenda Joyce's works. This book has more of a suspense edge to it; as do a lot of romances now.The problem with The Third Heiress is that the principle characters and their motives were not established early on in the book. One hundred pages into the book, I was still wondering what was going on in the book and why I should care.Going to a fiancee's funeral with his bitter hateful family, seeing a photo with the name &quot;Kate,&quot; and her last name on the of it does not make for a compelling mystery or much of a drama. Believe me, I did not stay up all night reading this one. There was no reason to. I did not like any of the characters, or care what happened to them."},{"Title":"The Third Heiress","review":"I don't like to read books where the \\"good guys\\" lose. Kate was such a lively character and in spite of the fact she disappeared nearly 90 years ago, the explanation of how she \\"ends\\" was horrible! Edward never found happiness and was estranged from the son he should have loved more than life itself. Anne's complete transformation to a hateful woman was hard to believe. Alex falling for Jill was tough to swallow, as she lost control of the car that killed his cousin. Hal's obsession and stalking of Jill was never fully explained. The ending was not only unsatisfying, it didn't bring closure to the \\"Kate\\" mystery. Pick up another one of Brenda's books to read..."},{"Title":"The Third Heiress","review":"I've read EVERY book written by Ms. Joyce, and I was desperately waiting the release of this one. Unfortunately, I am currently about 300 pages into it (almost finished) and I am heartbroken. If you are planning on picking this up, expecting another incredible love story full of romantic turmoil and strong passionate characters, THINK TWICE before you buy. Ms. Joyce does a wonderful job writing contemporary suspense and mystery, but there is NO ROMANCE to speak of. I am proud of her ability to break into a new genre, but I am saddened that this book lacks the passion and fire her others (like &quot;The Game&quot; and &quot;The Conqueror&quot;) are famous for. 200 pages into it, and there still hasn't been an intimate scene between the heroine and the man you assume is the hero! Two sloppy love scenes by the end of the book (both animalistic and extremely impersonal) are too cold and lacking in any real mental involvement between the two characters. I spent more time feeling frustrated and depressed (due to the morbid story line) than feeling excitement, passion, and hot desperation that is usually drawn out in her incredible stories. Ms. Joyce, I congratulate you on your courage to write a new and different book, but please weave some of your incredible romantic magic into the next one!!! ...Meanwhile, I'm off to read the ending (with reluctance), and hope that it will not disappoint too much."},{"Title":"The Third Heiress","review":"I have only read a few of Ms. Joyce books and read this one on recommendation by a friend. First off I read just about any genre so I was not put off by the fact that this was more of a mystery novel with a dash of romance added between Alex and Jill.My problem with this read was due to the fact that I felt that some of the sub plots (i.e Lauren, Thomas, and the rest of the family dislike/like/back to dislike) as well as Jill's friend KC witnessing her friends apartment being broken into were never fully explained (meaning why were these problems introduced if they didn't play a part in the story except to add several pages to the read) and another question that plagued me was when exactly did Alex start feeling things for the almost always nauseous Jill? She was constantly wanting to or getting sick. The mystery about Kate was a good vehicle which moved the story forward and the several pages that went back and explained who Anne, Edward, and Kate were was in my opinion very interesting. Jill on the other hand made me frustrated, angry, and forget about feeling any sympathy for her! First she is constantly unsure about Alex but not enough to prevent her from sleeping with him. The total lack of communication between these two people was another difficult thing to understand. The rest of the family was at turns nasty and then nice but it always seemed as if the explanation of how these people felt for Jill was always left hanging. The mystery regarding Hal and his love affair with Kate was in my opinion only a sad way in which to introduce the whole premise of the story.If you want a frustrated 400+ page read well this is the book for you. The only thing that kept me turning the pages was 1) I wanted to see if things would work out between Alex and Jill with a certain amount of credibility and 2) to find out just exactly what happened to Kate all those years ago! Do yourself a favor and pick this book up second hand or borrow one from a friend."},{"Title":"The Third Heiress","review":"The story started very promisingly. It intrigued me to read on and find out what happened. Then Jill got increasingly paranoid and neurotic. She kept behaving in ways that she soon hated herself for, which was annoying to read. Alex was mysterious, why he fell in love with Jill was mysterious too. The problem with the story was that there were not enough reasons for readers to understand why Jill and Alex cared about each other.It was the sub-plot that shone. The story between Kate and Edward was moving. In fact, Kate was the most vivid and haunting character in the entire story. She got most of the best lines too. I wish the author could devote the same talent to the character development of Jill, Alex and Edward. Kate was so heartwrenchingly steadfast in love and friendship, yet her death was so tragic and haunting. The image of how she suffered fear, hunger, cold, helplessness, hopelessness, pain and yet still keeping her faith of love and friendship was too moving and haunting. After the fierce quest of Jill to find justice for Kate, I found it hard to accept that there was not.There were many flaws in the story. It did not make sense that Kate sent her son away because she felt something might happen to her and yet left no trace about who she was meeting.I finished the book without feeling satisfied. I could not get enough of the tale between Edward and Kate, Edward and Anne. I wished I could read more about Edward in the years after Kate. Somehow, the relationship between Jill and Alex was not important at all."},{"Title":"The Third Heiress","review":"The Third Heiress by Brenda Joyce was a very involving book. It swept me up in its story and suspence. What made the book such a page turner for me is that you honestly don't know who to trust. The leading male character, Alex is in many ways a question mark through out the entire story. Should Jill trust him or not? Just when you begin to have faith in him, he does or says something to make you suspicious of him again. The story line that takes place in the past is also a page turner. What exactly did happen to Kate? Where did she disappear to and why? Brenda Joyce never gives away the ending until it's upon you."},{"Title":"The Third Heiress","review":"SPOILER ALERT!!!!!I started reading the De Warenne books earlier this year, and since I've essentially read everything there (at least the 7 books starting with \\"The Prize\\"), I started looking at Brenda Joyce's other books. I picked up three of her books at the library: Splendor, House of Dreams and The Third Heiress. I liked Splendor and House of Dreams, but The Third Heiress really annoyed and irritated me. It kept my interest, and I actually cried throughout about the last quarter of the book, but I was horribly disaeppointed at the end, and it left me feeling completely unsatisfied.I don't recall ever reading a book where I didn't want the two main characters together in the end, but Jill was WAY too accepting of Alex and what he and his family did to her. Doesn't she have any self-respect? The murder that they are so desperate to keep buried occurred almost 100 years before the modern day setting of the book. All of the people involved have died. And, there probably wouldn't have even been a mystery had Hal's family not acted so suspiciously to begin with. All they had to do was behave themselves through the funeral, and she would have left. But then, of course, there wouldn't have been a book.I didn't like who Alex was revealed to be. It might have helped if we had gotten the story from both Jill and Alex's points of view, because then we would have the opportunity to view Alex's motivations and values. Of course, that might have meant giving away some of the secrets that Alex kept throughout the story. The way it was written, Alex came off as the family's gigalo. I can imagine the family getting together and deciding that Alex should get close to Jill to find out what she's finding out about Kate -- and since they have so little regard for her as either a distant relative or as Hal's girlfriend, if he seduces her, then no big deal. At the end, Jill seems to say, \\"oh, o.k., you've lied to me all along; you've known the answers to my questions; you deleted the letters I thought might provide answers; you stole my DNA to have a DNA test run; you told your cousin to pay me off to leave; and you stood by when your family resorted to physical violence, but I know you love me, so it's o.k.\\" He really hasn't acted like he loves her at all. That doesn't sound too co-dependent does it? What's more, his temper was completely unpredictable. In most of Brenda Joyce's other books (the ones I've read), there are negative character traits that the characters must overcome, but their transformation is more believeable because they seem to realize their mistakes and grow as a result (think of Devlin O'Neill and St. Xavier in particular). Alex is the same in the beginning of the book as he is at the end, and doesn't grow at all. Also, how does English aristocracy have poor American relatives that are close enough that they take the orphan into their home when his mother dies, but allow him to live in poverty before that?As a cat lover, the decapitation of the cat, particularly one that we had come to know and like, was impossible to get over. And if Lucinda was an animal lover who set up Jill to pet sit for her neighbor, how could she have killed her neighbor's cat, even if it was to serve as a warning to Jill? There was no reason to kill the cat.Hal sounds unstable as well. As a 13-year-old boy, he saw a painting of Kate and becomes obsessed to the point that he sets out to America to find her long lost great granddaughter, photographs her to look like the object of his obsession, asks her to marry him, and then decides it's not a good idea and he should go back to his on-again, off-again aristocratic girlfriend? It might have been helpful if we'd known more of what was going on in his head, because he sounds like a stalker.The biggest disappointment, however, is that there is no justice for Kate. Anne left her to suffer and die, and as a consequence, she married Edward, lived a comfortable, long life and only confessed what she had done when she was on her death bed. O.k., so we get a small glimpse through Edward's letters and the flashbacks that he didn't love her and treated her coldly, but there's no indication that she ever felt any remorse or was punished in any way.The fact of the matter is that there are so many troubling aspects of this story that I can't even see a way to satisfactorily rewrite it. I'm glad that this wasn't my first Brenda Joyce book, because I never would have read any of her other books."},{"Title":"The Third Heiress","review":"There has been some real bad reviews on this book but I thought it was wonderful! It lost a star from me only because I would have liked the roles of Alex and Thomas reversed. Thomas was far more appealing in a more dangerous and mysterious way, and the chemistry between Thomas and Jill throughout the book was electric. I suspected early on that's where Brenda Joyce was headed and halfway through the book couldn't figure out how to bring the two together because of the family ties. Bummer. I have looked for Thomas's story and can't find it, which is sad because he was quite a man! The only downfall to this book is you cannot put it down...seriously!"},{"Title":"The Third Heiress","review":"I am a long time romance reader of author Brenda Joyce. I have historically only read her older books - traditional regency or earlier romance books. My favorites are: After Innocence, Secrets, The Rival, Beyond Scandal, Splendor, Finer Things and Captive. All of these were good - top notch - especially After Innocence, Secrets and Captive. \\"The Third Heiress\\" is the first modern plot line of hers that I have read. I found it pretty good - more pleasing than I thought it would be although, there were some drawbacks to the story. I am torn on this one as not every question in the book was revealed or explained. In some ways that disappointed me but, in others, it worked as we shouldn't always have every question answered in a good book or in life in general.I think the thing I liked the most was how this author wove together details from the present time and that of the past. She was able to blend historical letters, re-telling of past events as they happened with the modern plot line and current on-going events. Even though things went back and forth - I rarely lost track of what was happening.I liked how the main character Jill was driven by an unspoken and unclear bond to the woman from the early 1800's named Kate. The book revolved almost completely around Jill's visit to England to bury her recent boyfriend/fianc&eacute; Hal and her meeting up with his family and friends. The events from this funeral ceremony and burial begin Jill's long term research project of trying to find out what the connection was between Hal's last words to her when he died in a car crash \\"I love you....Kate\\". Jill's early emotions at loosing Hal seemed very real and understanding. The emotion pulled you in.Jill meets up with one of Hal's cousins, Alex in England...and he seemingly believes in her quest and helps her along as he has access to people and places she does not. They spend most of the book being attracted but, not trusting one another at all. Lots of second guessing going on - this was an unappealing modern twist if you ask me. Much of the conflict revolves around Hal's family distrust and dislike of her due to her connection to Hal and what she is trying to uncover that could cause modern problems for their well established family.The sinister aspect of the book will please mystery buffs as you try to figure out who is Kate, how did she die, how does she tie to Hal's family and Jill and...who is trying to hurt Jill as she discovers clues about the past.Romance fans will enjoy the background tale of Kate and her beloved Edward - Hal's great-grandfather. The love that bloomed between Kate and Edward was real and tender...a beauty to behold. Their conflict of not marrying and being with their child was an equally emotional part of the love story line. . No one will take to Anne - Edward's eventual wife and one time friend of Kate or what happens to the girls' relationship.Contemporary readers might enjoy the relationship formed between Jill and Alex as they search for the truth, yet have to learn to trust one another become they can go forward with a future together. Unfortunately, their relationship left me empty. I wasn't buying he adored his family, would protect them at all costs and loved his dead cousin Hal who was killed basically by Jill and then halfway through the book - voila - he suddenly becomes nice, attracted and falling for Jill? Didn't work for me. Too contradictory. Jill was often drinking, taking pills, fainting away, getting sick or having sex with Alex in between researching the past. Alex was on the computer or phone or going to meetings and always being secretive. He even hid documents behind her back, didn't tell her the truth he knew and even wanted her paid to go away. So...they had some quick and hot sex now and that but, that was it. How can you form a relationship under these conditions? Didn't work for me at all. I don't care for modern romances anyway and this one didn't sway me to change my mind.There are many characters in this story, Jill- the lead, Hal - the main lead until he is gone immediately in the book (Jill's now dead lover), Hal's entire rich, wealthy and very British family - The Sheldons (Alex, Thomas, Lauren, The Countess & her husband William), the curator of the estate Lucinda, Jill's American friend KC, historic Kate, Edward and Anne. (There was also a few cats in the book but, one met with a serious demise and I love cats so, I would omit that scene - yuck!) There was a lot of people to keep up with but, everyone seemed to play important parts in the book. Who was real, who was hiding something, who knew details, who did not and so on. Interesting. There could have been some more individual development of all these characters but, the book was almost 500 pages so...I expect the editor said, cut it down! I think there should have been fewer characters and more development.I have a few serious regrets and drawbacks when I think back to the story:1) I am still left feeling that Hal was such an important person in the story but, I don't feel closure occurred with his situation. Perhaps I missed something? He was Edward's great grandchild and he was drawn to Jill (Kate's great grand daughter). Hal and Jill had a short lived but, intense relationship, loved one another and clearly tied together to the past although only Hal knew it early - Jill much later. Was Hal re-living what his great grandfather couldn't - being with the woman he loved, telling her so before he died as he didn't get to in his past life? Or was it a new relationship? Is the point here that Kate breaks the chain by finding out the truth and finding a new love finally in the modern world? Thus...the past truly ends finally? Both Hal and Jill were obsessed with the past once they began to understand it but...Hal seemed to love Kate - almost like he was like another Edward. Jill on the other hand loved Hal but, not like another Edward. I'm a little lost in this area to be honest...(maybe another reviewer will discuss this later for me...)2) Edward lived his life and never knew the truth of what happened to Kate (that she stayed for him, loved him and was going to even have his 2nd child!). I feel angry that he did not search for her or consider something bad befell her (especially since he hated his father and what he made him do - maybe even his father had done something to her?). He accepted she went away by choice due to Peter being left behind. She never talked about leaving - why would he think that? I didn't like that he questioned Kate could leave him for another man when she gave everything of herself to him. Plus...he took the word of Anne who no longer seemed close to Kate - that should have been suspicious. It was like after a year of Kate being gone - Edward made peace with her absence and went back to being a dull, dry, withdrawn and cold Brit who could handle anything - even loosing the other half of himself - the love of his life - Kate - yet still live a average life. That was disappointing and sad. Edward also never got close to his first born son Peter as he was so like Kate - he loved him but, never close. Sad.3) The reader finds out what happened to Kate in the end and who did it but...her body was never found for a proper burial. That's sad too. I would have thought her rich family in America would have launched a serious investigation to find out something about their missing daughter and NOT given up until they found something. After all...there were 3 people at the cottage taking care of Kate during her secret pregnancy and she had a child at the hospital...You would think something would have come from this information had someone looked. I thought that was a lost point to the story.4) I did not care for Jill telling Alex and the family she would NOT reveal to the public what happened all those years ago to protect the current father and family. She had an obligation to disclose the wrong done to Kate and Edward and their son Peter and finally make it right. I didn't buy that Kate floated off into the distance once the secret was revealed. If I had been the ghost of Kate...I would be kicking some butt to these stupid modern people. To me...not disclosing the truth once known was as bad as what happened to Kate the first time around. She was harmed the first time by a dear friend...the second time by a family member if you ask me! Hal's ancestors and current family members all got the benefit of great lives due to a very terrible thing one of their own did many years before. So...evil granted them all gain in the end. Goodness and kindness did not win out. Jill dishonored Kate a 2nd time by what she did if you ask me.5) No one found out how cruel and terrible Anne was until the modern world. You would think Anne's own mother would have come clean as it concerned life and death. Clearly...having her daughter married to the top catch in the country so, family ties and power would bind was enough to over-look murder. Horrible!6) I think the ending should be changed to have a satisfactory conclusion to the story line. The police should be notified of the earlier crime done, what occurred now as the truth was uncovered, the Sheldons come clean and Jill placed back in the family with her cleared history/name and fortune. All should be made very public for new record keeping. I would like that Kate's body is found (in the root cellar that Alex & Jill walked past!), a proper ceremony done and burial too. Next to Edward if possible. And...Jill should begin a new life in England with her British blood and have a healthy relationship and start a family finally - as she never had one. Without these things....I am left feeling very unfulfilled....As I mentioned above there were some serious drawbacks to this story but, it is still worth reading. I guess I liked it over-all because I saw the potential and even though it fell short, enough was there to keep me going. I feel a lot of people will see different views and aspects to the story than others do. It has some complexity in parts and with everything between woven together at different points instead of all at once, it does give you some food for thought. I would wish for a different ending but, that's not meant to be. If you have not discovered this author yet you should. She writes both mystery novels and historical romances. She has a lot to offer many different types of readers. Pick up a book, read it, I think you'll be pleased. Even though \\"The Third Heiress\\" was a departure from me...it was worth it. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Third Heiress","review":"I purchased this book after reading a glowing review of Brenda Joyce's latest release &quot;House of Dreams&quot; in People magazine. Rather than spend the money on a hardcover from an unknown (to me) authoress I decided to check out one of her paperbacks first. I am in total agreement with all who have complained about her use of repetitious phrases. I was beginning to feel that if I read the phrase &quot;Was Alex making a pass&quot; one more time, that I was going to have to throw the book out the window. And all that business at the beginning of the book with Jill fainting at the drop of a hat was absurd, to say the least. Actually quite a bit of this book was absurd. However ... I haven't given up yet and plan to buy another Brenda Joyce today."},{"Title":"The Third Heiress","review":"I was encouraged to read Brenda Joyce's new book on her past reputation. Sorry, I was disappointed. The story line had a lot of potential but it was too long and dragged on and on with no resolution in the end. It was like Ms. Joyce started writing with a great idea, then she herself lost interest and 300 pages into the story realized she had too may loose ends to tie up. Jill was a lunatic. I kept waiting for Jill and Alex to show some romance, and all I got was rough sex. The story from the 1900's was much better than the contempory. Other reviewers talk about the dialog. I was going crazy with &quot;...she licked her lips&quot;. And whole thing with Hal's affection for Kate was weird. I just purchased another Brenda Joyce book. I hope I have a better read with this one."},{"Title":"The Third Heiress","review":"This was the first book by Brenda Joyce I've read and I loved it. It grabs you right from the first page and dosen't let you go until you've reached the end. There's just the right mix of romance and suspense. I hope Brenda Joyce will keep writing more books like this."},{"Title":"The Third Heiress","review":"The Third Heiress was a very disappointing book for me. None of the characters including the ghost were particularly likeable. The plot and writing held my interest but the heroine was constantly in hysterics, the hero was a jerk, and any romance between them was totally unbelieveable. I finished the book feeling very unsatisfied."},{"Title":"The Third Heiress","review":"This book is another fantastic book from a woman who I consider to be the best escapist novel writer around. Brenda takes us through many twists and turns with her two main characters, Jill and Alex. Although I would have liked a little more insight into Alex's thoughts, overall this book kept my eyes completely glued to the pages. I would suggest to anybody reading this review to not read any further, as another reviewer gives away a great deal of the plot and spoils a surprise. Read The Third Heiress for yourself. You will not be disappointed!"},{"Title":"The Third Heiress","review":"If I could enter this review with NO stars, I would. I considered the writing to be totally formulaic and suspected the ending almost immediately. Jill, the heroine, was irritating and unbelievable. I agree with every bad review heretofore entered except the ones that liked any of it. I am angry that I wasted my money and time"},{"Title":"The Third Heiress","review":"I believe this is the first and not to be last book I've read by Brenda Joyce. I love all kinds of genre but romance and mystery are my favorites. Third Heiress has the best of both. I especially liked the inclusion of different time periods...almost a time-travel type story but more realistic. I recommend it highly. Like the other reviewer, I too stayed up too late reading it but just couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"The Third Heiress","review":"For those of you (like myself) who automically buy any of Breanda Joyce's books, you might want to pause and read the reviews on this one first. While it's a very well written thriller, it's not a romance. I know it's not fair to pigeon-hole a writer, and I applaud Joyce's wanting to expand her scope, but I was a little disappointed in this book. I wanted to curl up with a great love story, not sit up all night with a tense thriller.This is a mystery with a token love story, not a love story with a token mystery.Having said that, it is a good book, and a very engrossing read. A little like &quot;Jagged Edge&quot; with a bit of &quot;Possesion&quot; thrown in."},{"Title":"The Third Heiress","review":"This is a fantastic book! Great mystery plot, suspense, romance and hot love scenes - what else could a person need? Once I picked this book up I couldn't put it down - stayed up way too late reading it. I'm going to start reading more of her books."},{"Title":"The Third Heiress","review":"The Third Heiress was an excellent read, I loved the chemisty between the characters and storyline always kept me wondering. You won't be able to put it down!"},{"Title":"The Third Heiress","review":"Though there is a good story here, the first fourth of the book was mawkish and overwrought, and very repetitive, too. I only kept reading because it was in the car, and I was taking it to places where I had appointments to kill the wait time. Part One could have been cut by 80%, without suffering, and been a lot better read. After that things picked up. The reader knew from the first mention of Kate's disappearance who the likely villain was, and sure enough there was no surprise. I did get very impatient, too, with the heroine wrapping her arms around herself to show her emotion every two or three pages. Less is always more, and it would have been refreshing to have the author be a bit more imaginative on that score. The plot was more imaginative, however; even if too predictable in its outcome."},{"Title":"The Third Heiress","review":"Brenda Joyce can really write- her books are page-turners, but this one didn't make sense. (By the way, don't read further if you haven't read the book yet and don't want to know the ending.) The story of Jill and Alex and the whole plot unravels at the end. Apparently, the whole Sheldon family knew who Jill was and they had a trust fund for her. So why did Alex and everyone else deny it and tell her she was a romantic for thinking she was related to Kate Gallagher? Why did they offer her money to \\"go home\\"? If they told her what they knew, the whole Kate story would not have been unearthed. The author could have plotted this a lot better. Jill was supposedly a dedicated dancer, but she moped around and drank for weeks without any mention of her exercising- did she have a hint she would be a millionaire by the end of the book?Other reviewers have mentionned other inconsistancies. Kate's mother conveniently disappears before Kate is abducted. Kate's hands are tied when she goes into the tower but then she seems to be untied later with no explanation.The book was a good read but I felt betrayed at the end. KC's predictions were mostly red herrings, and the whole book was not well plotted.I read The Rival by Joyce and really enjoyed it although \\"she froze\\" was repeated so many times it was distracting. The first book I read by Joyce was \\"The Captive\\". In my opinion, this book has no ending. The author wrote herself into a corner; the characters didn't trust each other but had a tremendous physical attraction. There was nowhere to go, and the promised \\"sequel\\" never appeared to my knowledge.In summary, I would like to see this author improve her plotlines."},{"Title":"The Third Heiress","review":"I have read a few of Ms. Joyce's books and I have to say that the woman knows how to spin a story. The Third Heiress is definitely a great book, BUT while reading it your under the impression that something is missing. I think the missing piece in the book is the romance that builds up between Jill and ALex. The mystery that the book has is superb but the love story seems kind of stilted. As a reader I found that I'd have preferred Jill to have ended up with someone else other than Alex because throughout the novel Jill can never trust in ALex and it makes no sense for her to end up falling in love with him. There is never that connection where you can say this seems like true love between the hero and heroine.Anyway...if you're looking for a romance novel this is not the book for you, but if you want a mystery read the book!! THe mystery is great! You get completely absorbed by Jill's fascination for Kate and her &quot;quest&quot; to find out her roots."},{"Title":"The Third Heiress","review":"I thought this book was great! This is the first book that I have read by Brenda Joyce and it definitely have to read another! This book had me in suspense from the very first line! The only things that I didnt like was the ending. I wanted to find out what happened between Jill and Alex and what Jill decided to do..... is she went back to New York, if the family excepted her, ect! I hope that Ms. Joyce makes a second book to this."},{"Title":"The Third Heiress","review":"This is the first novel I have read by Ms. Joyce and it certainly won't be my last. There have been several books I have read in the past few months that have stuck with me for quite a few days, this is at the top of that list. I have never been so enthralled in a storyline as I was with Jill and Kate. I wanted so badly to get to the end to see what happened that I couldn't put it down; but at the same time I didn't want it to end. It amazes me how an author can come up with a plot as detailed and as captivating as Ms. Joyce has here! I am a big Historical Romance reader and found the transition between present day and early 1900's to be refreshing. This book not only kept me guessing right up to the end but it kept me completely riveted and engrossed in the characters' emotions and turmoil. I would definately recommend this book to not only historical and modern day romance buffs but also to mystery fanatics as well. It has just enough of these mixtures to satisfy anyone's interest!"},{"Title":"The Third Heiress","review":"This was a great read. It was a wonderful combo of mystery and romance novel. From the very first page I was hooked. One of the most enjoyable reads in a long time."},{"Title":"The Third Heiress","review":"I hate those typical brainless, mushy romance novels that are about sex with a storyline written around it. This book had me hooked from the moment I read the first page. It wasn't ... your typical romance. It intrigued me, and I connected with Jill and Kate instantly. Yes, there are some faults to the book, but it's a great way to spend a rainy day. For those who don't count so well, Jill IS the Third Heir(ess). If Ms. Joyce continues to right in this style, she can be assured of adding another reader to her list."},{"Title":"The Third Heiress","review":"Why do the really good authors of romance books feel a need to &quot;graduate&quot; to thrillers and mysteries? &quot;The Third Heiress&quot; is full of implausibilities, errors, and nonsense. Did any reader really think for one minute that Alex was the villain? For that matter, did any reader even care? Go spend your money on a good, old-fashioned romance. Please, Brenda, forget this new trend."},{"Title":"The Third Heiress","review":"I commend Ms. Joyce's efforts to shift into a more suspensful and mysterious gear, but for me, it lost the ususal in-depth romance between the characters. Maybe in an effort to write contemporary, Ms. Joyce is adopting today's common philosophy of casual sex between partners who never really get emotionally involved? I missed the communication and emotional turmoil that her characters normally have, and since I'm not much of a mystery fan - the plot that took it's place didn't fill that void. If you prefer a light romance, however, with a suspense twist - this might be more for you. In the meantime, however, I will be re-reading some of Ms. Joyce's classics like The Game and The Conqueror. Those were definitely her best."},{"Title":"The Third Heiress","review":"To me, this book couldn't decide what genre it belonged in. Is it a romance, romantic suspense, ghost story, glitz? Who done it? I didn't care; the girl was long gone! Too many coincidences and stilted dialogue added to my dislike of this story. Then, there's the so-called love scenes; added I'm sure to give the author's fans a fair dose of her trademark sensuality. I'd pass on this!"},{"Title":"The Third Heiress","review":"I could not put this book down - I read it in about 3 days. It's different from her other books, but nonetheless, very enjoyable. The first chapter draws you in and the storyline keeps you going until the end. I've read several times now and am still intrigued by it. I highly recommend it to romance and mystery novel lovers!"},{"Title":"The Third Heiress","review":"hey i read the reviews and i juss gotta sya it i really liked this book. no i havent read ne of her other books to compare it to,so u may think that i sholdnt be commenting, but hey i liked the book. it had everything, even a surprise twist at the end in my opinon. so go read it"},{"Title":"The Third Heiress","review":"She has done it again. She manages to keep readers excited. The novel builds up the suspense."},{"Title":"The Third Heiress","review":"My sister gave me this as a must read and now I have recommended it to many friends. It started out a little slow but then I got caught up in the circumstances that this young girl must endure after her fiance is killed in a car accident. It mixes contemporary fiction with a bit of historical fiction as well. I was constantly trying to figure out who the bad guy was and enjoyed her many twists along the way. I was thoroughly entertained."},{"Title":"The Third Heiress","review":"I am a little more than half way through but came on here today to see if anyone else who read this book picked up on an annoying little habit of Ms. Joyce's to repeat herself, namely the constant repetitiveness of using &quot;she, Jill,...&quot; and &quot;her, Jill,....&quot; over and over again as if we don't know who she is referring to. I was hoping this is not a trademark of hers because I'd like to read other books by this author, but this annoying habit has me wanting to hurl the book across the lawn. The only reason I haven't is because I want to see what happens! Little quirks aside, I am really enjoying it."},{"Title":"The Third Heiress","review":"I enjoyed this book as much as any of Brenda's books. It had all of the mystery, romance, and excitement that I enjoy in her books. I loved the time jumping and as always the details of the periods. I couldn't put the book down."},{"Title":"The Third Heiress","review":"If you're looking for a piffle to while away a couple of days at the beach, this is it. The romance between Jill and Alex isn't romantic. One thing that really irritated me is that Brenda Joyce uses the word &quot;huge&quot; to describe just about everything. I also found it annoying how Jill, who lived in a small New York apartment and had very little money, could meet a person and instantly identify Gucci shoes, a Hermes tie, an Armani scarf, etc. How would she know? The subplot about Jill's ancestress, Kate, is simply ridiculous. I felt no sympathy for the young woman being shut up in a tower--she was such an obnoxious character I would gladly have done it myself. It was really stretching it to believe her friend would do this. I never want to read another book by Brenda Joyce."},{"Title":"The Third Heiress","review":"I could not believe some people wrote bad reviews.... I read 1 book a day (and work full time too- so I chose books that are exciting, romantic and with great suspense with hot love scenes) This book had it all.... The next morning I am still excited, and feeling for the main characters.....that makes a good book.... I feel connected with the main character Jill, watching her grow and feel like I know Kate!!!!! I am disgusted with the villain of the book and get annoyed that he/she got away with things....But it was a great book....you have to read it! Ignore the other reviews....read it you will feel you are a part of the book"},{"Title":"The Third Heiress","review":"Great book!!! I have been reading Brenda Joyce for a while (Deadly series) and this is my favorite book"},{"Title":"The Third Heiress","review":"I usually enjoy books by Brenda Joyce, but The Third Heiress left me feeling a little disappointed for the following reasons:First, the main character, Jill, was so high strung that I didn't think she would survive the rest of the book. That kind of severe, emotional intensity all the time was a little too much for me. How many times was her heart going to stop then start beating again? Secondly, the book never showed Kate &amp; Edward sexually. I was curious to see how her exuberant attitude would be displayed in bed. Thirdly, there were only 2 (fantastic!) sex scenes in the whole book! The whole book! Come on, Joyce! You can do better than that!On the flip side, I never would have guessed the ending! The suspense was wonderful! I was on the edge of my seat!But I'm still a fan so don't worry. This book won't break us up! (smile)"},{"Title":"The Third Heiress","review":"While the story engrossed me, especially the sub plot, there were times when I got so impatient with Jill that I felt like throwing the book down. She did not come across as very smart. Every time she went snooping (which was often), she got caught. She always seemed to be on the verge of a nervous breakdown and drank whenever she got the chance ;-). Hard to imagine how Alex could ever have fallen in love with her! There were a few instances where I felt the plot was stretched too far. The basic plot was great, though, and Anne's betrayal of her best friend, Kate, was well set up. Kate was vividly portrayed, though even by today's standards she was very forward. Not surprising that her life should have come unstuck in the prudish early part of the last century. (I guess Jill inherited her unsmart genes.) I kept hoping she would escape (good suspense here) and that Jill would find justice for her. The end was a bit of an anti-climax."},{"Title":"The Third Heiress","review":"Okay- I've only read one other novel by Brenda Joyce... House of Dreams. The two plots are, in my opinion, almost EXACTLY alike. This novel is lacking originality and romance. The writing is adequetely written, but I wouldn't recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Third Heiress","review":"Aside from the fact that character development of Alex was totally weak (I believe in the concept of instant attraction but the circumstances and the lack of deeper characterization of these two made it very hard for me to believe it here) this book had me mesmerized until the absolutely lame ending. The thing about mysteries is that they have to have a PAYOFF, something that gives justification to the fact that you've spent an entire day reading the book. Even an ending having to do with ghosts or spells or other implausibilities are ok as long as we're set up for that, but in this story the thing about Hal was so stupid as to actually get me angry. And what was the deal with all of those visions that she had? She inexplicably (supernaturally) got drawn to Kate and had the experience of essentially being transported in time. Either please explain that anomaly or run with it truly by making it an aspect of the story and resolution. One of the least satisfactory stories I've read in a long time, probably because the beginning held so much promise."},{"Title":"The Third Heiress","review":"Normally I love Brenda Joyce's work, having read all of her novels, but I was greatly disappointed with The Third Heiress.I felt the plot was too ridiculous to be believed. I wondered why Jill had such a fixation over Kate, and why she'd be so concerned with a possible murder from 90 years in the past.Throughout this never-ending book, I found myself thinking, &quot;Oh, please, let's be a bit realistic here!&quot; No one, but no one, would be so concerned with Kate and what had befallen her so long ago, and I also found it hard to believe that Alex would willingly wrap himself up in this &quot;mystery&quot; as well. More than likely, he'd have walked away muttering to himself.One major annoyance--&quot;He stared.&quot; &quot;She stared.&quot; I was about to scream. Certainly Ms. Joyce can manage better than that.Normally a fast reader, I think it took me a week to get through The Third Heiress.

I noted that several other characters also &quot;froze&quot; on a regular basis. I agree with a previous reviewer who was annoyed with Ms. Joyce's constant use of &quot;...she, Jill...&quot; and &quot;...her, Jill...&quot; as if we had forgotten the main character's name. Some of the reviewers had commented on how much they had enjoyed her previous attempts at romance writing, but if these are examples of her literary skills, I won't be rushing out to buy them. It almost seemed as though Ms. Joyce had written the novel, then hadn't bothered to go back to READ it. Her love scenes were clumsily written, using words not usually used in this genre of books. While I enjoy a good love scene in most books of this kind, I found hers gross and disappointing.What WAS Hal's agenda? And did I miss something, but wasn't Jill the SECOND heiress? Kate was an heiress, her son (Jill's father) would have been an heir, therefore &quot;she, Jill&quot; would have been the second &quot;heiress.&quot;Jill was TOO frantic and strung-out, Alex was TOO impersonal and sneaky, the family was just TOO mean. Why would we like or sympathize with any of them? I, too, wish there were a rating with less than one star, as I view it as a total zero."},{"Title":"The Third Heiress","review":"I love romance/suspense stories. Romance with suspense is what keeps a reader gripping a book into the wee hours of the night. This story started off with a wonderful prelude. When I finally flipped the last page, I actually felt irritated, angry and sad. This is a combination of two stories; one in the past between Kate and Edward, which paralels the present between Jill and Alex. This could have been a wonderful romance/history/suspense novel. The actual story is clever and intricate. Unfortunately there are too many gaping holes left open up to the very end. What was Hal's hidden agnenda anyway. We all get to guess what he was truly trying to accomplish. His nephew Alex, one of the main characters is weak in more ways then one. Other than his love making abilities, he shows little integrity and absolutely no backbone or loyalty to a woman he is suppossed to love. He is as white bellied as the rest of those blue bloods that so graciously adopted him. (I kept waiting for the real hero to evolve) The main love story is about Kate. And I fell in love with her and Edward. ... All of those that are rich in wealth are poor in character and all their deception is swept under the carpet, in both stories...up to the last page."},{"Title":"The Third Heiress","review":"I have to agree with the &quot;reader from Detroit.&quot; I wish I had read her review before I purchased this book. She echoes my sentiments, exactly. I thought this was a horrid book; there was no passion or romance. I am a huge fan of Brenda Joyce, and I don't understand why she wrote this book, other than to break away and try something different. I woke up in the middle of the night after having finished this book, and was instantly depressed. I hate what happened to Kate and I hate that there was no justice for her. I think the plot was too contrived and predictable. I was very uncomfortable with the way the characters so blithely thwarted Jill in her search, Alex included. I did not find him at all attractive, especially after Jill finds out what he did with the letters. I also thought the rest of the family was arrogant and morally reprehensible. I hope Brenda gets back to creating the magic that was so incredible in her other books. This book should not be marketd as a romance; it is barely a good mystery."},{"Title":"The Third Heiress","review":"I really enjoyed this book! It is not typical Joyce, but it was wonderful. It is more thriller/mystery/ghost story than romance, but has enough romance in it to be worth it. The story is tightly written and has interesting twists and the ending is a surprise. There are 2 story lines unfolding throughout the book, that of the 1906-1909 romance and mystery and the other of the story of the present day hero/heroine. Both story lines have mysteries and intrigue. I found that when I just sat down to read the first couple chapters to see what it was about, I could not quit easily. I finished this hefty book in 3 nights, having to force myself to bed on the middle night at 2:00 am. I was wishing I could just finish it in one night, or not have to go to work! It was tense, the love story was appealing, and I am left with lots of thoughts of the characters, even now, after I have finished the book.

I love mysteries about genealogy so was thrilled at the beginning of this story. The loose ends left me disappointed and it felt like the story really didn't have an ending either. The explicit, second by second sex scenes were way over the top. They were distasteful and certainly not sophisticated. Some intimate details are better left unsaid and add much more of your own imagination to a story. It's like the old adage, \\"Less is more.\\" This novel was certainly not very well thought out. Here are some of my questions: How did Hal actually find Jill in a large city like the NY area? What really happened to the elderly lady in the nursing home? Who forced entry into Jill's apartment back in NY when she was in London? Why was Kate's mother and her circumstances never mentioned again after the disappearance? What was really Alex's agenda? (He was so ambivalent in his dealings with Jill) What was the point of the entire British family denying any knowledge of the disappearing event when they actually knew most of the details? It seems to me they were \\"cutting off their noses to spite their faces.\\" It certainly doesn't represent British aristocracy in a pleasing manner! Who erected the tombstone in the cemetery and did the count know about it? If so, why did he not investigate the placement of it? So much of this story was unrealistic. The mystery could have been presented in a true-life manner and still been very compelling."},{"Title":"The Third Heiress","review":"I'm only halfway through the book, and even though I love the story line, the Jill character is just TOO annoying, TOO strung up, TOO neurotic. I can't udnerstand how someone as put together and in control and studly as Alex can put up with someone as hysterical as her. I was hoping that they'd have a love scene or two, to, you know, loosen her up a bit. She's one weird chick. Couldn't stand her. But don't worry, Ms. Joyce, won't quit on you altogether.

The last word Jillian hears Hal whisper is Kate. Jillian escorts Hal's corpse to England for a proper burial. His family treats Jillian with utter contempt, going so far as to insist he was to marry someone else.Jillian obsesses over the name Kate. She needs to know who the woman is that graced her deceased fianc&eacute;'s final breath. She turns to Hal's cousin Alex Preston for help. As they work to uncover a mystery, they begin to fall in love. However, Jillian must wonder if she trusts Alex with her heart as he is part of a family who hates Jillian because they blame her for causing their beloved lad's death.Readers always celebrate the release of a new Brenda Joyce novel. The audience holds the author's tales in high esteem because of their terse romantic suspense story lines that leave fans clamoring for more works by Ms. Joyce. Her latest thriller and her first contemporary, THE THIRD HEIRESS, centers on Jillian's needs to do something besides her all alone, unrelenting mourning after total rejection. She selects the mystery of Kate to keep her mind off her loss followed by guilt when she realizes she loves her deceased fianc&eacute;'s cousin. The mystery is entertaining and the suspense rapidly mounts into a terrific climax. As good as Ms. Joyce's plot is (and it is excellent), this novel clearly belongs to the intrepid heroine.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Third Heiress","review":"I really enjoyed this novel.

The presupposition lying behind this task is that the biblical books had \`authors' and \`readers,' and that the authors intended their readers to understand what they wrote (see, e.g., 1 Cor. 5:9-11; 1 John 2:1; see the Appendix). Exegesis therefore answers the question, What did the biblical author mean? It has to do both with what he said (the content itself) and why he said it at any given point (the literary context)-as much as that might be discovered, given our distance in time, language, and culture. Furthermore, exegesis is primarily concerned with intentionality: What did the author intend his original readers to understand?\\"This book is for those very serious about exegesis. It's very broad, but accessible for any student, pastor or anyone serious about studying the Bible.Although the book was originally written 20 years ago, it has stood the test of time and has been revised in both the 2nd and current 3rd edition to keep it very up to date.Is it necessary to know Greek to utilize the book?This is addressed in the Preface to the first edition but also in the Introduction to the 3rd edition:\\"A final word to those who use only the English Bible. First, you need to take heart that you can learn to do exegesis as well as anyone else. Knowing Greek gives one obvious advantages in several matters of detail. But the person without Greek who is willing to do a bit of extra work can enter into the full joys of this discipline. You must take seriously the need to learn the Greek alphabet; that will give you direct access to most of the better tools, especially when it comes to the study of words.\\"For those who do know Greek the book goes in-depth into using Greek as part of exegesis.Take a look at \\"Search inside this book\\" and start with the Table of Contents to get a good overview of what's covered.Fee mentions a wide array of resources for research related to each step. Bibliographic material is mentioned within each chapter in addition to a whole chapter devoted to the material, based on category.One could easily spend over $2000 on these books which may be a little overwhelming for some. For those without an extensive library of their own, the help of a public library or even at the minimum--the internet, a couple of good study Bibles and a couple of in-depth commentaries covering the passage you will be exegeting--one could get by and do most of the things outlined in the book.Also overwhelming is the sheer number of steps required in the first chapter, many of which are explained in the second chapter. This is geared to a student who will be writing a paper on a passage of Scripture. The third chapter abbreviates the steps for pastors who have approximately ten hours a week to prepare a sermon.I thought it would be helpful if the steps in chapter three were directly correlated to the steps in the first two chapters.It's important for everyone to carefully read the whole book. For English only readers, reading the portions related to Greek are still valuable. For students, the chapter for pastors is important for remembering application, prayer and reflection so that it doesn't become only an academic exercise. Pastors will want to be very familiar with the first two chapters so they can tailor the steps to their needs with Fee's guidance as outlined in the third chapter.The Appendix, new to the third edition, explains what Reader-Response Criticism is, how popular this has become and how dangerous it is. I see it everywhere and this is not a good thing."},{"Title":"New Testament Exegesis: A Handbook for Students and Pastors(3rd Edition)","review":"an excellent book will help pastors and students in second and third year in Greek to apply all you learn in class on preparing your messages and teaching lessons.The book also has Gordon Fee's own bibligraphy from Historical to cultural to the best three commentaries on each book of the New Testament."},{"Title":"New Testament Exegesis: A Handbook for Students and Pastors(3rd Edition)","review":"New Testament Exegesis: A Handbook for Students and Pastors is a trememdous study aid that guides the user through practical applications of the process of exegesis. This book is a great resource for a student writing exegetical papers and for any pastor who teaches or preaches from the Bible."},{"Title":"New Testament Exegesis: A Handbook for Students and Pastors(3rd Edition)","review":"With the amount of material before him, the student of the New Testament faces a seemingly insurmountable challenge. Many feel this way and resign themselves to the fact that they cannot and will not ever sift through the material and present an accurate and scholarly exposition of a text. In their defeated mentality they soon slink away to consult second hand commentaries and surface level context works. This is the attitude which Gordon Fee challenges in his book, \\"New Testament Exegesis.\\"Fee separates his book into four main categories. First he deals with an overall guide for full exegesis. Second, he works through the exegesis of the original text. Third, he takes a moment to offer a short guide for sermon exegesis. And finally, he gives the readers some practical tips in finding aids and resources which contribute to the previous three sections.As the student begins his study, several initial steps much be taken. He must have a proper understanding of the historical context, the textual limits of his passage, and an acquaintance with his passage. He must then analyze the sentence structure of his passage, challenging himself to follow the authors flow of thought and major and minor arguments. He also must interact with textual criticism in determining the authentic reading of his text, analyze the grammar and significant words, and research the context and background within which this letter is found.Fee also sets out a broad look at the various genres found in the New Testament. He gives the student a plan to deal with Epistles, Gospels, Historical Acts, and Revelation. Within each of these categories, he walks through the various steps one would take if they were handling a passage from that genre. This is very helpful because approaching the Gospels with the same mentality as the Epistles can completely skew the author's intended purpose.The second section of the book dealing with the exegesis of the original text delves farther into the in depth study of the text than is normally attempted. Here the student must be willing to dedicate much time to diagramming the passage and understanding the flow. Also, extended work is done in working through textual variants and grammatical possibilities. This is not a task for the faint of heart or owner of a short attention span. This is tough work. Individual words must be studied in their various usages and growth throughout the hundreds of years they were in use. Also, the historical background is more seriously engaged. Finally, the passage as a whole must be analyzed and explained.Fee spends a comparatively short amount of time in the sermon preparation and then moves into aids and resources of which the student should be aware. This final section is of extreme helpfulness since he categorizes the resources which the student should consult.Fee's work is one which every student should own as he heads out into the daunting world of exegesis. His simple steps lead the reader through the daunting forest of possibilities to the choicest fruits of exegesis."},{"Title":"New Testament Exegesis: A Handbook for Students and Pastors(3rd Edition)","review":"This manual has impressed me because it provides an real algorithm for biblical exegesis, an algorithm easy to learn and to apply in many cases, an algorithm including the more important aspects valid for modern exegesis."},{"Title":"New Testament Exegesis: A Handbook for Students and Pastors(3rd Edition)","review":"A good supplemental aid in study of language and meanings as used in context of writings."},{"Title":"New Testament Exegesis: A Handbook for Students and Pastors(3rd Edition)","review":"Fee's work lays a definitive foundation for exegetical method in NT stuides. His approach is logical, seqeuntial and orderly. He covers every important step in the process and provides helpful examples along the way. This is a book you will certainly want by your side if you are a NT student. There is even a section for \\"shorter exegesis\\" for preachers, Bible class teachers, etc. Fee does an outstanding job of being concise, not wasting words or including extraneous material. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"New Testament Exegesis: A Handbook for Students and Pastors(3rd Edition)","review":"I think that the best way to describe the purpose of the book is to steal the first paragraph from the author's preface to the first edition: &quot;A former New Testament colleague was once asked by a student how he could learn to do exegesis, intending that his teacher should suggest a book. My colleague answered, 'You will just have to take a course.' That answer is the tacit admission of what all of us who teach NT know to be true: There simply is no book that serves either as a textbook or a guide for students to learn the exegetical process, from the opening of their Bibles to the writing of the paper. This book hopes to fill that lacuna.&quot;This book's target audience is an academic one whose end to exegesis will be a paper (or an expository sermon), but as a layman I have found it to be extremely helpful, even indispensable, in my exegetical endeavors to better learn and therefore accurately apply the Word of God. Also, the book is written primarily for those who know Greek (I do not know enough to even be dangerous); however, in the new edition Fee has made the attempt to provide alternative exercises (such as compare many different versions and maybe use a textual commentary to try to determine as close as possible the original) for the English only student.CHAPTER 1: Guide for Full ExegesisChapter 1 basically organized in outline form, providing first the &quot;initial steps for all genres,&quot; first naming the major exegetical step that must be performed and then providing more and more detailed information and guidance on each step. Then moving past the steps that are the same for all genres, Fee gives the steps necessary for various genres (i.e. Epistles, Gospels, Revelation, etc). Finally the chapter ends with a section on moving from interpretation to application.CHAPTER 2: Exegesis and the Original TextAlso arranged in outline format with the following sections (1) Structural Analysis, (2) Establishing the Text, (3) Analysis of Grammer, (4) Analysis of Words, (5) Historical-Cultural Background, and (6) Analysis of Pericope. Just as in the other chapters, the outline works from very general headings and general paragraphs of information to very specific and technical subheadings.CHAPTER 3: Short Guide for Sermon ExegesisI find myself often in Chatper 3 as I study as Fee uses this chapter to show how good, solid exegesis will move into the most powerful, Word-filled sermons. If you teach from the Word (as a pastor, small group leader, youth group leader, whatever) I recommend this book and this chapter in addition to Rediscovering Expository Preaching by MacArthur et al.CHAPTER 4: AIDS &amp; RESOURCES FOR THE STEPS IN EXEGESISFees ends in referring the student to othe very useful resources organized by type.I would be amiss if I did not address the one downside to this book which I believe is the temptation to &quot;do the steps&quot; and skip the prayer, the heartsearching, the repentance, the awe, the worship. An unregenerate person can &quot;do the steps&quot; and if done responsibly come up with an exegetical position, maybe even a correct one. We cannot know God through human wisdom (1 Cor 1:21). Fee mentions this temptation, but it is by no means the focus of the book, nor should it be. The temptation to be purely academic in Bible study is a great one, and a &quot;how to&quot; book on the subject could propagate this error in some. However the book should not be condemned simply because the method of presentation (which is a highly effective one) could be taken by the cold hearts of some to their folly. Rather, understand the evil of your own heart which is always beside you (Romans 7:21), crucify your flesh, repent where necessary, and seek the truth of God which is found in the Bible with a disciplined, passionate fervor. It is in this final endeavor that &quot;New Testament Exegesis&quot; is invaluable.Finally, if you use Libronix Digital Library System, I would STRONGLY recommend you go ahead and buy this along with Stuart's Old Testament Exegesis book for Logos. If not you will find yourself with a dog-eared and bookmarked book as you flip back and forth as Fee makes extensive use of referencing other portions of his text."},{"Title":"New Testament Exegesis: A Handbook for Students and Pastors(3rd Edition)","review":"Fee's handbook is probably the best guide in doing Exegesis available today. It is useful both for the one who knows Greek and for the one who is forced, by lack of language skills, to work around this deficiency. His technique for doing so will enable any diligent student to work around this and still use many of the best helps in the field.Fee also guides you step by step through various projects for which one would do exegeis. Whether that be a scholarly paper, a Sunday morning sermon, or other types of research.As noted above, the resources he guides one to are indeed worth the price of the book in itself, as it is an indispensible tool in library building."},{"Title":"New Testament Exegesis: A Handbook for Students and Pastors(3rd Edition)","review":"Laypeople, seminary students, and even pastors who think they know what 'exegesis' means need to get this book. Fee's contribution here has been recognized for some time as a vital tool for conducting responsible exegesis, and the praises it has received are most warranted.This book methodically lays out various steps that should be taken in conducting exegesis. These steps include lexical, historical, cultural, theological, genre and text critical analysis that forces the exegete to really do their homework and research. At a time when preaching, teaching, writing, and debating techniques have reduced the Bible to pet proof-texts and inch deep examination, this book provides a much needed corrective that insists on a combination of deep seriousness and thorough study and research when handling the Word of God. I have used many of the steps in this book to conduct some preliminary exegesis on various passages of Scripture, and the result has been that I learned more in a couple months about the passages in question than years of independent and mostly aimless study revealed. This is a book that will help equip the reader with the ability to conduct responsible exegesis, and will also equip the reader to effectively and intelligently critique other books and articles that fail to substantively engage the text.As others have noted, the suggested sources and reference materials that are listed throughout the book are quite good in giving the reader not only good exegetical steps, but reference works to actually put the steps into action.In conclusion, while I believe that there are valuable exegetical steps that can be taken in exegesis that Fee does not list here, this book is nonetheless a very good and absorbable resource that will enhance evangelical scholarship and preaching if leaders and teachers, not to mention laypeople, take its contents to heart."},{"Title":"New Testament Exegesis: A Handbook for Students and Pastors(3rd Edition)","review":"This exegetical guide is my favorite one because he gives practical step by step procedures for the exegetical side of a sermon. Note that the application of one's exegesis in the form of a sermon is not really the focus of the book. It's wise to look elsewhere for sermon development in that regard. But for exegesis, it is the finest volume I've read. In fact I used to own the previous version and upgraded to this one.What I've found very useful is to take the steps Fee has created and make them into a checklist in a word doc. Then when working on a text one can simply check off the items. If you become foggy on an area, Fee gives plenty of resources to round out your knowledge as well as descriptions through out the book.For students he gives a full exegesis guide also. That is actually the main portion of the book. But for pastors the 'Short guide' for sermon exegesis seems daunting at first, but when used, is extraordinarily helpful in developing a command of the text.Fee also gives a time guideline for each exegesis step. This gives you an idea for whether you work slower or faster than most. I've found it also helps me develop a schedule.Wouldn't want to pastor without this book.

Many of his ideas, especially his ideas about working through textual variants, are fresh and provide a solid push toward sound exegetical work. My main two criticisms of this book are: 1) His use of BCE and CE instead of BC/AD, and 2) His failure to flesh out integrative theology and the use of wider context in exegesis more thoroughly. He makes the comment that there are likely no references to the OT in the NT that are ignorant of the OT context, but he doesn't tell the reader how to integrate the theology of OT passages with the theology of the NT passages. This could have been done better by dealing with types/antitypes in the exegetical process.

This novelized play reads quickly and delightfully. I've read more than twenty of his novels, and this was the quickest of them all.The plot is simple enough (at least for James): two houses, apparently back to back, in Wilverley, a small English village, set the scene. One contains a widow, the other a young married couple. The young wife widows the young husband, and he becomes Wilverley's \\"most eligible bachelor,\\" except for the fact that he promised his dying wife that he would never marry again, at least not during the life of his child. So somebody has to kill the child, right?Enter James's genius for character. There's Paul, the huge, infinitely imperturbable son of the wealthy Mrs. Beever; the diminutive and impetuous Dennis Vidal; Tony Bream himself, a remarkably good-natured but insensitive fool; and the powerful Mrs. Beever, whose awful determination cows every one else before her. Like James's best writing, his characters become interesting on their own; his fictions become an opportunity to satisfy curiosity. I think that's what makes this book a \\"page-turner\\"; the characters are interesting enough that I want to know what's going to happen.In the end, I suppose, what makes this book succeed is what would have made the dramatic version fail: James's endless fascination with the workings of the human mind must have become either painfully boring or just incomprehensible to a theatrical audience. However it came about, I recommend it unequivocally."},{"Title":"The Other House","review":"I am impressed with The New York Review's revival of this unexpectedly non-Jamesian title. A truly unique James choice to bring back to life--it's been done so with a cover so compelling (I'm not a tradional James fan) I opened the book which I found locally in a brick and mortar as they are now called, book shop. The internet cannot do justice to the thoughtful sophistication of this book's packaging. (But I can purchase another copy here more easily!) The publisher's comments about the work were also compelling and complimentary to the cover art. The Other House is a mystery, a detective story, a love triangle with more than three angles--a true page turner--with a timelessly human plot and &quot;modern&quot; characters. Anyone thriller fan would be enchanted with it. And turning every page, holding the book, is a sensory thrill. Paper, writing, art--all representative of what any literary rebirth deserves. If it's worth bringing back--do it with quality, I say! They did--along with a whole marvelous collection of equally intriguing books, with well written new introductions. Good choices--the pieces themselves, the introduction authors and the book artist designers. Truly timeless in all ways!"},{"Title":"The Other House","review":"This book is a novelization of the play by the same name. And you can see the stageplay - the characters are continually coming and going - and there's stage business - all of which I think shows some stiffness - yet about half way through the novel I was startled at how much the characters were real, rounded - I could just about see them - they ached with life - I was always aware of the stage during the novel - the story itself is rather shocking - it's a mystery novel! - it's all very well done - it's short - and it's very psychological"},{"Title":"The Other House","review":"Among all of H.James's novels, this is the only one that deals with murder. It is not a mystery though. We follow the build up to the situation. We know who does it and why, and we know why nobody blows a whistle. Nobody gains anything by disclosure. A highly immoral tale.Murder was not a subject that came easily to James. The story seems, for a long time, more about the usual. Manipulative mother trying to make her son shape up for the right girl, and doing her best to make him not go for the wrong one. In order to avoid the wrong one, she lays some bait to make that girl go elsewhere. Everybody else also meddles in other people's affairs. One wonders why. This is a most meddlesome and uninteresting bunch of people.The question is: do we believe it, is there truth to be found in this tale?Critics have questioned the killer's character. The deed is doubted. Motivation is said to be weak. The character is said to be insufficiently developed.I think, if we read the story, a short 200 pages, with a reverse engineering attitude, we cannot be surprised. If we know from the start what will happen, there is some advance warning. In fact, the whole sorry entanglement of misinterpretations is quite clear. But does it work? I have my doubts.For a late James, this text is quite accessible and entertaining. For a novel it is short. It is actually a rejected and rewritten stage play. I can see why it was rejected as a play.It is hardly a lasting masterpiece. The master himself didn't think so and left it out of his own selection of collected works. The man was an astute observer (though he knew that observation was just a consolation for the powerless), and he mastered the art of amusing sentences (though he often abstained from using his skills.) There is a contrast between the flippancy of style and the tragic error of its story. The deed goes unpunished, but also unrewarded. The evil of the deed is a mismatch to the overall frivolity of the tone."},{"Title":"The Other House","review":"Henry James wrote an outline for a play, to be titled \\"The Promise\\", in 1893, but no producer showed interest. Never a writer to waste a page, James then used his outline to serialize this odd novel \\"The Other House\\" in 1896. I call it 'odd' because it's still a play in three acts, each chapter patently a stage set -- a room in one mansion, a garden, a room in the \\"other\\" house -- and each of the first two acts ends with a stunning tragedy. Not only a play! A full-blown Victorian melodrama, a murder mystery replete with the conventions of the 19th C stage. Best of all, it's obviously an imitation of the plays of Hendrik Ibsen, whom Henry james was 'championing' in the British press in the 1890s. In fact, if James had given his outline to Ibsen, and if Ibsen had written \\"The Other House\\", I have no doubt that it would be considered a masterpiece of the stage.Of course it's improbable and melodramatic, but no more so than some of Ibsen's works and most of 19th C theater pieces. Likewise, it's no more improbable (and a good deal wittier) than most murder mysteries of the 20th C -- pop novels like Agatha Christie's, I mean, and immensely successful films and TV dramas. Reading this short novel has given me an epiphany: James was a hack! Or rather, he wanted to be a hack, a fashionable writer, a popularizer. He knew his audience. He wanted to write exactly what that audience wanted to read or see on stage. Judged with the same tolerance that one feels for cheap crime or a sprightly-shallow cinema, The Other House is lovely entertainment. I note, as evidence, that this novel, which all the Jamesian scholars and critics disdain, has received ONLY five-star reviews! James the hack would surely feel vindicated.You, dear reader, will enjoy this novel most if you read it in that spirit and as a particular genre, a prose-play. It's very tightly plotted. Symmetrical, suspenseful, sensationalistic. James probably had no talent whatsoever for stage- or screen-writing. The dialogue in The Other House only 'works' because it is embedded in Jamesian prose. Henry J needed a collaborator, but Ibsen was Norwegian and Oscar Wilde was detained.James's aspiration, conscious or sub-conscious, to write pop fiction was thwarted by the complexity of his own mind. He could never write as trivially as he wished. The Other House is clear evidence. Its depiction of genteel society in England is fiercely satirical and condemnatory. The charming, gracious, graceful women and bluff, open-hearted, honorable men in this tale are all revealed as moral monsters. Love, the great motivator, inspires these prudent, proper upper-class Britons to falsehood and cruelty. As a drama, The Other House is as sardonic as The Doll House or The Master Builder. Luckily for later readers, Henry James could never succeed in mashing his complex psychological insights into pulp fiction. He didn't have the mind of a hack."},{"Title":"The Other House","review":"I find it hard to believe that Henry James knew how to ratchet up the tension in this clever way--at times, too cunning--but it should come as no surprise that there is a darkness, an insanity like murder beneath the surface of the most proper British households, in this case, the people from \\"The Other House.\\" The tension of the novel comes from James knowing how to keep the lid on, so to speak, and when to let some steam drift out. His art is in the way the characters hold back or speak out, conceal and reveal. In The Other House, one can hear the approach of his future masterpieces, The Golden Bowl, The Ambassadors, and The Wings of the Dove. But there is something about this novel that makes it closer to \\"easy\\" reading than any of his novels I know. The Other House is surprisingly entertaining, and mostly dialogue--a result, probably, of his play-writing experience, but also because in the 1890s upper-class people still went to great lengths to conceal their sexual desires beneath lovely sentences.At times, James makes even the most disciplined reader (moi) wait too long for key facts--more so in this novel than others. I was irritated that he didn't make it clear that Mrs. Bream's first name is Julia and that Miss Armiger's first name is Rose. The name Jean Martle is repeated too much, and I always got the names of the houses mixed up; Eastmead is one, and Bounds must be the \\"other\\" of the title, from Mrs. Beever's point of view. The two houses and two families, partners in a single large banking firm, made their money from overseas colonies. And the man who seeks to marry Rose, Dennis Vidal, spends a lot of time in China, where, apparently the British system allowed for a lot of fortune-making. But the women have money, too, and so husband-hunting is not the problem when so many women focus their laser-beam of attention on the charismatic Tony Bream.But there is something strange, some plot twist that is almost too, too forced in this novel. True, there are seven adults with complex psychological setups, but the women are over-wrought, over-determined, and over-drawn. Mrs. Beever's suspicious mind, I can see; she's older and on the look out, protecting her marriageable son, Paul, and her banking interests, and above all, her business partner, Tony. But Julia Bream and Rose Armiger are fine knots of nerves, over-excitable, and given to wild thoughts and actions; perhaps James tried to explain this by giving Julia and Rose a stepmother who was a kind of emotional terrorist, who made their girlhood toxic. (We never see Julia Bream nor the stepmother; Julia is bed-ridden and her words are reported through the filter of other's apprehension.)I've heard it said that Sigmund Freud's patients were created during the 1890s; now I see it, through Henry James. Dr. Ramage, who attends Julia, is a point of stable reference, and toward the end of the novel, I thought he was going to summon the police to investigate the murder scene. A less wealthy household would have called the police rather than so readily devise and agree to the cover-up and the getaway. Yeah, someone should have gone to jail; perhaps that happens years later, in another kind of novel, by Zola, perhaps.A phrase near the beginning of The Other House describes the entire novel: \\". . . they faced each other over the deep waters of the accumulated and the undiscussed\\" (46). Yup. And then there is that mysterious four-year gap (between part one and part two of the novel) during which almost anything could have happened between Rose and Tony, after Julia's death and while Dennis was back in China, and Jean wasn't on the scene. Ah, the unsaid and the subtext."},{"Title":"The Other House","review":"This is a review of the Kindle version, which appears to be derived from an OCR scan with little in the way of proofreading, correction, or emendation. The indignities perpetrated on this rather gripping yet largely unread tale from James' late middle years (contemporary with The Awkward Age and What Maisie Knew) render this presentation largely unreadable. Instead of evincing wonderment at James' clever marvels of device and artifice, it leaves one, as it were, wincing at such infelicities as the chapter entitled \\"I11\\" and the passage which informs us \\"I fi*f. A\\"6-who, having heard the last words of the two girl-s,//' c ame, accompanied by the servant, down the - hally\\". The Master surely deserves much better."},{"Title":"The Other House","review":"A trusted friend sent me a copy of this new edition of The Other House, insisting that I'd enjoy it. It looked intriguing. I felt obligated to at least give it a try. I still trust the friend! I can't believe this is what is known as a Classic. I thought they were all very boring. I couldn't wait to get back to this plot and I'd never have thought it was written in the uptight Victorian era. It's more like a movie special of the week or one of the top ten best selling novels. Read it then recommend it and impress your friends with your literary depth."},{"Title":"The Other House","review":"First, a confession. I read this book because I am munching my way through the NYRB Classics Series not because I am a Henry James fan. James is actually on my relatively short list of unreadable authors, so I approached this work with some trepidation, but a willingness to give it a try.The good news for me is that the novel is less Jamseian than usual. The darn flock of commas hasn't disappeared, but is under tighter than usual control, leading to less than expected sentences such as... \\"She paused so long, however, beautiful, candid and tragic, looking in the face her necessity, but gathering herself for her effort, that, after waiting a while, he spoke.\\" Page 223 in case you think I made that one up.The book starts with a not terribly helpful introduction by Louis Begley first explaining the ugly duckling concept and then half-heartedly arguing why this novel doesn't fit that description. Then why bring it up in the first place?This is a book of star-crossed lovers, but after awhile it is more of an intricate chess game. While we are given hints of simmering, suppressed passion, more space is given over to logistical concerns. How does A maneuver C to the other house so that G will see that C is really a cad not deserving of her affections. And the instrument for this maneuvering is language. People gently prod, dance around, evade. But not with actions. The murder of a child, Effie, is almost the only action in the book, but even that is not observed. It is instead obliquely dissected with language. The event simply another chess piece maneuvered for the relative gain of one party or another.The other event in the book is the death of Effie's mother. The mother extracts a death bed promise from Tony, her husband: thou shall not marry so long as Effie lives. Whatever else happens in the book, we know this promise has sealed poor Effie's fate. But most of the characters are unable to see outside the horrid obsessions of their doomed loves. While Rose is the monster who kills Poor Effie (and this result is so obvious that it doesn't, I hope, constitute a plot spoiler), this reader at least was relieved someone finally burst the fetid bubble of star-crossed lust dripping on all of the hapless characters.When Rose decides to remove Effie from the scene, and from life, a conversation ensues as to why she all of a sudden develops a concern for Effie...\\"It's because of that that I want her!\\"\\"Because you adore him - and she's his?\\"...\\"I adored her poor mother - and she's hers.\\"Chess, pure chess. In the next move Effie is gone, poof.At the end there is a Gothic denouement. Rose will not be persecuted because, essentially, the fetid lust tainting so many of them makes it impossible to simply pretend that Rose, and only Rose, is to blame. So she and most of the characters are sentenced to continue their hapless lives, knowing that their ill-directed lust will condemn them to a purgatory well beyond that available in the English justice system."},{"Title":"The Other House","review":"This edition was very expensive for the shoddy way it was put together. The title page was on the left. Title pages are always on the right. It had no copyright page. The odd-numbered pages were on the left, and the even-numbered pages were on the right. This is exactly the reverse of legitimately published books. Just look at any volume in your possession. Odd-numbered pages are always on the right. If this book had been cheap--I mean really cheap--I could have accepted this anomaly, but it was far from cheap. It cost as much as many hardbound books. It was not worth the money.Furthermore, the story was very unlike Henry James. He meant it to be a play, but after the colossal failure of his first and only staged play, he turned it into a novel. The ending was most unsatisfactory with a murderess getting off scot free."},{"Title":"An Apple for My Teacher: Twelve Writers Tell About Teachers Who Made All the Difference","review":"An Apple for My Teacher is a book that helps students and teachers alike realize their importance to one another. The tweleve stories included show what makes a good teacher and how influential a figure a teacher is/can be in a student's life. I enjoyed reading about the various ways and the different types of teachers that influenced these writers. Surprisingly not all of the writers chose teachers that were a 'traditional' teacher nor did they all choose teachers who specifically taught english. The only problem with the book is that it seems dated because most of the authors went to school many years ago. It would be good to have a 'newer' version of this book. Even though the time frame is a bit old the feelings and experiences presented in this book are still relevant today."},{"Title":"An Apple for My Teacher: Twelve Writers Tell About Teachers Who Made All the Difference","review":"As I had to give a talk about the influence of good teachers, I readthis book in search of good quotations and anecdotes by writers about teachers who had influenced their careers. It was not thebest source for that, although I still like it that when Kim Novaksaid she had been doing a lot of reading and was asked what, forinstance, she'd been reading? Her response: Mostly poetry and prose. And John Barth chose his own wife as teacher.

Perez Firmat is honest, creative, educated, and experienced! An exile himself, he is able to back up his analysis of the exile experience with his own history.This book stands out above his other works as the most significant. In it, he relates ideas about the exile experience, such as his exposition of what it means to live \\"on the hyphen,\\" and the extent of the challenges that exiled children face (the 1.5 Generation). Perez Firmat applies theory to 20th Century Cuban-American examples.This is a powerhouse in the world of Cuban-American Studies. It is written by a man in high standing academea (current professor at Columbia Univ.), but the book speaks in clear, concise language that can be enjoyed by anyone interested in the topic. I highly recommend the book and hope that you will use this book as a jumping point to read Perez Firmat's other books."},{"Title":"Life on the Hyphen: The Cuban-American Way","review":"Every Cuban immigrant who arrives in this country searching for political asylum, has tons of personal stories to share with the American people regarding oppression, persecution, torture, and the violation of human rights.As I finished reading Perez-Firmat's book \\"Life on the Hyphen,\\" I couldn't help but wonder what percentage of today's Americans, especially the young, would listen and learn from our experiences if for no other reason, at least to ensure they don't repeat the same mistakes or underestimate the evil powers that threaten our democracy now more than ever.I also realized that with the passage of time there will be less and less Cuban-Americans able to share their individual experiences about pre-revolution life in Cuba, under communist dictatorship, and ultimately, the struggles of Cuban exiles to assimilate the American culture without losing their genuine Cuban values and identities.If nowaday Americans would pay serious attention to our fifty-year plight and to the lessons learned as a result, they would appreciate much more what America means to us immigrants and to the world at large.

Think \\"Dilbert,\\" but without an evil boss. Kovalic focuses on Microsoft, hacking, music downloads, Internet idiocy in the wake of 9/11, and designing attractive video game characters. And most horrific of all: Carson is forced to use an antiquated 56K modem, which goes at the same rate as a dead hamster. Finally, there's a funny guide to i-managers in the final pages, which explores communications managers throughout history (\\"A bear ate your intern\\").Kovalic's mocking sense of humour can inject geekiness into any situation, from baseball games to door-to-door evangelists (\\"Well, I'd like to tell YOU about the Disciples of Zorbug, Despoiler of Worlds and Conquerer of Chaos!\\"). He's even making fun of himself by the end of Section 2.His artwork tends to be very simple and straightforward, with likably balloon-headed characters, ranging fromtall and balding to short and square. They live in a world of D&D; gaming, and seem to center their lives around defeating the dragon and sacrificing the thief.But don't worry, geeks. Kovalic laughs with you, not at you. Even as he pokes fun at geekiness, he also observes that the rest of the world has its own obsessions, oddities and jokes that don't make sense. The one problem is that some of the jokes have dated in the past five years (Napster and \\"Whazzup?\\" among them), but most of the jokes are still funny (Microsoft).\\"Livin' La Vida Dorka\\" is another hilarious collection of Dork Tower strips, showing again just how hilarious John Kovalic can be."},{"Title":"Livin' La Vida Dorka (The complete Dork Tower comic strip collection, Vol. 4)","review":"More hilarity from the wonderfully wacky world of Origins Award winning cartoonist and scribe John Kovalic, this collecion of Dork Tower comic strips is so good it makes me do the macarena and the electric slide at the same time!

Kamus of Kadizar is the one and only private eye on Ja-Lur, the Darkworld, where science and sorcery uneasily co-exist. A half-breed Darkworlder, he has visited Earth through a limited cultural exchange program, where he discovered the vocation of private investigator and determined to bring these functions back to the Darkworld.The Darkworld is a planet that is partially overlapped by the Darkness, an adjacent universe where magic can be effected by rituals. Those having the Blood of the Darklands can manipulate such magic by word and potions. The Darklord has the strongest magic, but his son Jann-Togah is also very powerful. Kamus has some magical abilities, but they are relatively weak.Darkworld has one spaceport near the city of Mariyad. The Terrans would like to build more, but the Darklord is content with the single existing spaceport. The Terrans keep encountering bad luck -- quakes, plagues, spontaneous human combustion, etc. -- whenever they try to construct another. The Darklord also enforces his Mandate that Terran science/technology is not allowed to function outside the limits of the port nor are manifestations of Darkness allowed within the port itself.A thousand years prior to this novel, the Darklord attempted to conquer all of Darkworld, but was foiled, primarily by Mondrogan the Clever, a Terran/Darklander half-breed. Thereafter, the Darklord has been restricted to Ja-Agur, but his influence is felt everywhere on Ja-Lur.This novel is actually an accounting of four different, yet related, cases during a time of magical disruption prior to Shadownight. All indications are that the Darklord will once again attempt to conquer the whole planet. Forces are gathering and the powers to be, both local and interplanetary, are growing nervous.In The Big Spell, Kamus acquires a client, a Darklander slave, who immediately tests his abilities by summoning a Darkling, a denizen of the Darkness. After Kamus defeats the creature, his client Valina asks him to find Kaan Ta'wyys of Thanare, an offworlder who had recently come to Ja-Lur with another Unity agent, Daniel Talon of Earth. These agents were searching for Edward Knight, another Terran but of the Blood. Knight had been onworld for seven years and had grown powerful in Darkness magic.Kamus reluctantly agrees to do some work for Valina. As he is checking his sources, Kamus learns that some barbarian is looking for him and eventually discovers that the barbarian is working with Daniel Talon and they want Kamus to find Valina. Then things get really confusing.In The Maltese Vulcan, Kamus is hired to protect a local deity from another solar system who has been threatened with assassination. He is also reluctant to take this case, but his client is poisoned while talking to him and then he meets a nice girl connected with the case and then her suitor is murdered, so what else can he do but catch the assassin and solve the murder.In Murder on the Galactic Express, Kamus is hired to guide an android and an Osteomech, a former human converted to a skeletal being made of bone, brainbox and fields, to a wrecked spaceship in the mountains. According to the android, he has rescued the Osteomech from a death-worshipping cult known as the Order of the Osteomechs, who are now hunting for them with murderous intent. Kamus is reluctant to take the case, for he has other things to do, but the android, Orpheus, offers to show him where the Black Mask, a powerful magical token, is hidden near the wreck. On their way through the mountains, Kamus encounters Valina fleeing from a vigilante mob.In The Man with the Golden Raygun, Kamus is trying to reach the Darklord to prevent his conquest of the planet and is offered a ride by an offworlder in an aircar. Since Kamus is short of time, he accepts and flies off with Valina and Polaris Lone, the offworlder. They make good time until the Darklord's Mandate, which had been ineffective for a while, suddenly flares up again and the aircar technology ceases to function. Suddenly they have to use the aircar as a boat.This novel is written in a style somewhat like the American detective story tradition, but Kamus is definitely not one of the violent killer types. He uses his sword to protect himself from assaults and his magical abilities to disable his attackers, but never intentionally harms nor threatens anyone. He gathers information and solves puzzles, usually in full view (but some clues are only suggested during the action). While these mysteries could possibly be solved by an alert reader, the endings always lead off into unexpected directions.Highly recommended for Reaves fans and for anyone else who enjoys magical detective stories with unexpected endings."},{"Title":"Darkworld Detective","review":"This wasn't a novel, it was a collection of four short stories with the same protagonist. The Big Spell, The Maltese Vulcan, Murder on the Galactic Express, and The Man with the Golden Raygun are their names, names mystery readers will be familiar with. The other review here summarizes them nicely.These stories were jam packed with action and plot, but little in the line of cleverness. By that I mean the deductions of the detective never felt like 'wow that was brilliant Holmes!' instead they felt like a mechanism for advancing the plot further and faster. I couldn't sympathize with Kamus, because Reeves tries writing him as a moral hero. This fails because he is never concerned by slavery or death, which is all around him in the stories. Kamus will have one or two thoughts on the matter, the proceed to forget about it in the next paragraph while the bodies are still warm. This behavior is very inconsistent. This was the missing element for me, not to mention Reeves makes a big deal about high galactic civilization, and yet here is a primitive slave planet where life is cheap. Meh.This novel was a solid three stars, merely Ok. The conflict of Kamus vs the Darklord is concluded in the last story, so dramatically the work made it. I felt it failed as a detective story because it had too many fantasy elements, and it failed as a fantasy because it tried too hard to be logical. The technology just felt like another excuse for more deus ex machina escapes."},{"Title":"Ghost Dance : The Art of JD Challenger 2002 Calendar","review":"Two things strike me about this calendar from JD Challenger. The first is that it is enjoying the phenomenal popular and commercial success that this artist so richly deserves; and quite frankly, it's very affordable compared to similar calendar products. The second is that the entire offering, all twelve months' worth, is consistent with a single theme and most definitely not meant to catalogue this artist's capabilities. This theme must mean something special to him; in fact, he attributes the Ghost Dance to the original inspiration that moved him to pursue a life dedicated to telling the Native American story in art. So on the one hand this calendar serves as an affordable yet fairly deep representation of an important theme in Challenger's artwork; but on the other hand, this offering does not attempt to represent anything even approximating the full depth and scope of this man's art. So if you buy this collection for yourself or as a gift, keep in mind that you're not getting a fully representative compendium of the artist's work... Nevertheless, the prospect of having twelve Challengers reasonably well printed representing such an influencial force to the artist makes this offering highly compelling to both the dedicated Challenger fan and the casual &quot;I-like-Native-American-Art&quot; calendar user. In not too many years hence, there is the distinct possibility that JD Challenger will become one of the most influencial and celebrated American artists of our generation. Since very few of us are ever going to own a &quot;real&quot; Challenger or even his increasingly collectible seriographs, the medium of The Calendar brings his message to anyone who can afford a dollar a month for artwork. And this is a great medium for this artist (in addition to obvious ones he pursues with such success); his is a message that deserves to hang on your refrigerator and not just in galleries and museums. And if you're ever through Taos, be sure to visit his studio; it's awe-inspiring to see some of his works-in-progress sitting yards away from a $40,000 canvas, each of which will ultimately hang in whatever serves as America's Louvre a hundred years from now."},{"Title":"Ghost Dance : The Art of JD Challenger 2002 Calendar","review":"JD Challenger is a Master of Native American Art.His Ghost Dance series continues to be one of the most collected works of American Art.Anyone who loves our heritage should get this and let JD work his Spiritual magic on you."},{"Title":"Ghost Dance : The Art of JD Challenger 2002 Calendar","review":"The art technique makes these images truly stick in your memory.

Challenger has given life to his art, and that is no small accomplishment."},{"Title":"Abundant Treasures: Meditations on the Many Gifts of the Spirit","review":"Sister Melannie Svoboda has a spiritual winner with her new book of essays, \\"Abundant Treasures: Meditations on the Many Gifts of the Spirit.\\" The book celebrates the expansion of our lives through the treasures given to us by a God whose goodness knows no bounds. To help us in that task, the author has chosen fifty-one gifts, gifts in the broadest sense of the word. Not only does she include the traditional seven \\"gifts of the Spirit,\\" but writes about others as well: attentiveness, bereavement, daring, failure, guilt, levity, relaxation, and whimsy.The gifts themselves are arranged in alphabetical order and each chapter begins with an appropriate quotation. The meditations are rooted both in Scripture and daily life. At the end of each, there are several questions to facilitate personal reflection. There is also a short prayer.I belong to a Spiritual Companions group of six priests in the Episcopal Church. At a recent meeting we read the essay on \\"Stability.\\" Several of our members were at low points in their ministries; all of us were feeling the stresses of parish life. Sr. Melannie's insights were an inspiration to us and helped us all get back on track. One of our group was moved to tears about her analogy of the screams of childbirth with the pain of self-knowledge. As Sr. Melannie puts it, \\"every moment of honest self-knowledge can, indeed, be a moment of birth.\\""},{"Title":"Abundant Treasures: Meditations on the Many Gifts of the Spirit","review":"I loved it immediately!

I only read one chapter a day and, like a wonderful fudge brownie, I savor it thoroughly. I love sharing the images that so captivate my imagination with friends at work and in cyberspace. What a wonderful gift Sister Melanie has. Her examples are REAL and life-giving."},{"Title":"The Mammoth Book of King Arthur: Reality and Legend, the Beginning and the End--The Most Complete Arthurian Sourcebook Ever","review":"I've had spotty luck with the Mammoth series before; some are quite decent, some are obvious hack jobs, and one or two are just loony (the Mammoth Book of Jack the Ripper pops to mind). This one is divided into three rough sections, of unequal size and value.The first attempts to break down the \\"historical Arthur,\\" who Ashley defines first as \\"the war-leader of the Britons at Badon Hill\\" and only second as \\"the guy who Geoffrey of Monmouth was talking about.\\" This results in a pretty thorough chase through obscure Breton king-lists, Nennius, the Ten Battles (fifty pages on them alone), the Welsh Triads, and so forth until he gets to a list of twenty, count-em, suspects. These range from Lucius Artorius Castus (the only Roman commander named 'Artorius' known to have served in Britain) to Arthwys ap Meurig (the king, perhaps, of Gwent in the seventh century, unless he wasn't). Ashley quietly plumps for an Arthur based in Gwent or Powys, but argues that Geoffrey's \\"Arthur\\" is a composite of five or six British leaders with mythic elements from Alfred and Aethelstan, and constructs a perhaps over-delicate genealogical lattice-work with which to argue that the victory at Badon was a coalition victory under a king of Dyfed named Agricola or Aircol, with one Vortipor/Gwerthefyr as the primary commander and possible \\"dux bellorum.\\" This is about as good as things get without getting into Deep History. If this section has a flaw, it's probably best highlighted by Ashley's nervous-making habit of citing Laurence Gardner's Bloodline of the Holy Grail without using the words \\"barking mad.\\" I'm certainly not an expert in post-Roman British chronicles, so for all I know, Gardner's research into the political-military complexities of the Saxon frontier is actually a model of meticulous restraint -- but I doubt it. Ashley does do a good job of highlighting when some fruity speculation is Gardner's and Gardner's alone -- the first time it appears. By contrast, he is politely dismissive of Geoffrey Ashe's various enthusiasms, and wisely so.That takes us to page 306, where we begin about 200 pages of primer on the Arthurian Cycle, beginning with some potted history of the twelfth century and then into the various versions of the Tristan, Lancelot, Perceval, Galahad, Merlin, and other sub-cycles through the 14th century. This is excellent stuff, well presented; the Grail section is remarkably free of utter crazitude, although again it's no substitute for a specialist work on the topic like Richard Barber's The Holy Grail (the best single book on the topic). Then a short chapter on Malory, and another brings us up to Tennyson and the Pre-Raphaelites. This is all clear and relatively straightforward; it's also stuff I probably could have assembled myself from my bookshelves -- but not in only $13.50 worth of my time. We close up with sixty pages of Arthurian novels, narrowly defined (no That Hideous Strength or Drawing of the Dark), and ten pages of Arthurian movies -- this is all pretty disposable stuff. Its lack of attention to poetry means only tangential discussion of Eliot and (what's worse) none at all of Charles Williams.Finally, we have about ninety pages of decent Arthurian Cycle \\"Who's Who\\" and gazetteer, more historically minded than Phyllis Ann Karr's wonderful (but primarily literary) Arthurian Companion and therefore of some good utility despite its relative brevity. A solid index in microscopic type concludes our program.Ashley has read, and widely, all across the topic; for example, he cites John Hughes' far from seminal work Arthurian Myths and Alchemy in passing while discussing Malory and the court of Edward IV. Ashley cites Littleton and Malcor fairly, although space (and his inherent charity, perhaps) prevents full attention to their \\"Sarmatian thesis.\\" He cites both Keys and Baillie on the Catastrophe of 535, and links it (too sketchily) to the discussion of the Waste Land. He even notes the possible ties between Amlawdd Wledig (from \\"Culhwch and Olwen\\") and Hamlet, although he (probably rightly) dismisses them. He misses one or two Arthurs from the fringe of the fringe -- there's no discussion, for example, of W.A. Cummins' dotty theory that King Arthur was actually a Bronze Age Wessex Culture monarch who built Stonehenge. (I'm hesitant to consider that particular absence a flaw.) Out there on the edge he does misstep occasionally; his brief discussion of St. Brendan badly confuses Brendan with Bran, both of whose immrama are relevant to the Arthurian mythos.But on the whole, minor notches in the Sword of Strange Straps aside, this is an excellent one-volume compendium of Res Arthuria. The movie list is by far the weakest section; the various side-by-side comparisons of the various Cycles is probably the strongest, with the Gildas-to-Geoffrey section on \\"historical Arthurs\\" a close second. If you're more interested in post-Malory Arthuriana, try Norris Lacy instead. But if you need one good book on King Arthur, with a strong concentration on the pre-Galfridian material and the relevant historical background, this is probably the one to get -- you certainly won't beat the price."},{"Title":"The Mammoth Book of King Arthur: Reality and Legend, the Beginning and the End--The Most Complete Arthurian Sourcebook Ever","review":"This huge book spans the length of Arthuriana and is an interesting read. However, I was left questioning way too much. I was constantly asking myself, \\"from where does Mike Ashley get his information?\\" I'm not saying it isn't authentic, but he rarely names sources. For instance, though I've read the geneologies available to me, I've never come across certain names or connections Mike Ashley gives. He always says \\"the geneologies state,\\" without saying which one. As a reader, and Arthurian scholar, I want to be able to authenticate any information given to me.Also, his \\"accepted\\" criteria for a generation (25-30 years) is way too calculated. With women having children at early ages and men fathering children even into old age (which wasn't that old in the Dark Ages), only a few generations could completely throw Ashley's time-scale way off. Just three generations of people having children at age 20 could throw the scale off by up to 30 years!Finally, the book is written as if definitive, though precious little known about King Arthur and his time period is definitive. In some places, Ashley gives information like it is historically accurate even though such information directly contradicts most Arthurian scholars. For instance, under the entry for \\"Anna,\\" Ashley says that the \\"name Morgause is almost certainly derived from Gwyar.\\" Under the entry for Morgause he implies that this name derives from Morcades or Orcades. This later explanation is the one generally accepted by Arthurian scholars, from what I've read. In fact, many of his supposed historic explanations for Arthurian characters contradict the majority of Arthurian scholars.This might seem small, but compounded over the length of 670 pages, you have a book full of contradictions and theory presented as fact. If only I knew his resources, I might be able to give this book more than 2 stars. As is, I found it almost entirely unuseful."},{"Title":"The Mammoth Book of King Arthur: Reality and Legend, the Beginning and the End--The Most Complete Arthurian Sourcebook Ever","review":"A perfect sourcebook for Arthurian lore, ranging from Welsh histories to modern movies and novels.

The brief, comprehensive summary and excellent illustrations help the reader to visualise and understand why Poland in the 16th-17th century was a power to be reckoned with.

Some of the topics covered in this volume are organization and recruitment, types of cavalry and infantry, armor and weapons, flags, command insignia, and field signs. This book is filled with photographs and illustrations that bring to life this period. Eight full-page artworks depict various uniforms with high attention to detail.The book is very well written, and Polish history is brought to life in words and pictures. Many aspects of this time are concisely described in this volume. After reading this book, you will want to read its second part."},{"Title":"Polish Armies (1) : 1569-1696 (Men-At-Arms Series, 184)","review":"At its peak, the Polish Kingdom stretched from Baltic to the Black Sea and from the Vistula to the gates of Moscow. After France and Russia, Poland had the third largest population in Europe. During its century of greatness, Poland's armies faced Swedes, Turks, Tatars, Russians, Hungarians and Cossacks. With their winged hussars at the lead, Poland's army was made up of that strange and colorful mix of east and west.Osprey's Men-At-Arms Series by its very nature can only offer a superficial look at the Polish armies of this period. As anyone who reads Osprey books know, the quality of the writing is inconsistent. Fortunately, Richard Brzezinsky is one of their best writers. He loves the topic and his enthusiasm is infectous. For me the only downside are the Angus McBride illustrations. Having finished this book, I am looking forward to reading Brzezinsky's book on the Winged Hussars."},{"Title":"Frog, the horse that knew no master","review":"Under its deceptive cover of a jumping horse lies one of the most enchanting period tales of a military horse that I have ever read.Author Colonel S.P. Meek has painted a collection of short stories based on an army horse that he knew during peace-time in Panama. Frog was a real Arabian horse that he knew between 1919 and 1920 when he was in command of the Empire's sub-post. Frog's legendary trick of jumping straight forward without any visible preparation gave him his name and appears during some of the horse's antics during the book.I highly recommend this book for a person looking for something a little different than the modern horse stories. It combines jumping, adventure, sabotage, polo, exotic places, racing, and a hearty dose of old-fashioned humor. As it was written many decades ago it reads differently than modern books, more like a cross between Hemingway and Dorothy Lyons.Collector's note: During some periods of its publishing this book was part of the set \\"Famous Horse Stories.\\""},{"Title":"Frog, the horse that knew no master","review":"I've always collected old children's books, especially those about horses and dogs.

Otherwise it was great."},{"Title":"By the Shores of Silver Lake","review":"The Little House series was my alltime favorite series as a child. I started reading this when I was 10 and I read the whole series in order, and after Plum Creek, this book was a totally unexpected turn of events so it was a shock. There was such a gap between the Plum Creek book and Silver Lake book. Laura must have been about 9 when we left off in Plum Creek. At the beginning of this book she is a pre-teen. The rest of the series from this book on were written for older kids. I struggled with the rest of the series starting with this book, due to a number of things. I had a hard time accepting Mary's blindness and so wished they could go back to being children. It was devastating to me. Also it was so sad about Laura's aging bulldog Jack dying. And as a child, I was like, who is Grace?!? Where did she come in?? I figured she was the new baby, of course, but it was sprung upon me so suddenly, like Mary's blindness. At 10 I thought these later books were a bit boring and didn't have as many pictures or as much excitement as the first books (i.e., fewer of Pa's wonderful stories, etc.). But I have gone back and read them as an adult and I LOVE them! I appreciate them a LOT more.Laura kind of switches roles from this book on; no longer is she considered a younger sister but is a bit of a leader since Mary's handicap, and she realizes she needs to grow up and stand by Ma and Pa, and one day become a teacher to filfill her mother's wishes and to help send Mary to college for the Blind."},{"Title":"By the Shores of Silver Lake","review":"The Ingalls have moved west in this next edition of the Little House on the Prairie series. Its just as charming as the other books and its always a pleasure to read Wilder's telling of her life growing up.When they haven't had a good crop in a few years, Mary going blind, and other bad luck, they decide to travel West to seek better land. First though, they stop off near where a railroad grade is being done and Pa becomes the storekeeper and payroll administrator. They live in a shanty where Laura gets to spend some time with cousins also in the area. When winter sets in, they become the only ones in the area and are fortunate enough to live in the Surveyor's house with tons of provisions set in for winter. They are joined later by friends and eventually Paul goes to make a claim on some land in the area so they can build a house and settle, hopefully for good this time.The characters in this book, although based on real life, are sometimes too good to be real people. Lots of virtue and hardly any flaws. But I can imagine that Laura chose to remember her family in the best light that she could. Ma was a little more warm in this book which was nice to see. I think that as Laura got older she developed a better relationship with her mother. She still describes Pa as being a wonderful guy in this book as well.Wilder has a nice writing style. Its easy for kids to read but appeals to all ages. She describes the time well and its easy to see the type of life they led. There are some offensive parts in this book though. Ma is not a big fan of Native Americans and doesn't mind saying so in this book. Despite it being the times where this was widely accepted, it could definitely be offensive for some people.This is a wonderful series that I enjoy reading many times over. This book especially is a great one because it shows Laura a little older and growing up as opposed to being younger and more child-like. It could really resonate with kids who are also at this age. Overall this is just a great book for family reading time and a classic in its own right.By the Shores of Silver LakeCopyright 1939291 pages + picturesReview by M.

The Ingalls family had not fared well during its sojourn in Minnesota, having been hit by a plague of grasshoppers that destroyed the bumper crops Charles had been heavily counting on, and though Laura, by now in her early teens, cheerfully describes this relocation, one can read between the lines and feel the disappointment that was there. This is not the best book in the Little House series, but because it bridges the years between the trilogy that described Laura's childhood, and the books that came later to take Laura into marriage and adulthood, it is an important one. The rigors of farm life, amid the wild west, railroad men, and a frontier boomtown are well told. And then there is a goodbye to an old companion here. Anyone who is able to bid Jack a dry-eyed farewell has no heart. The goodbye to a dog as loyal, bright and brave in reality as any canine in fiction ever was, should bring tears to any child or woman reading this and probably has done-in more men through the years than would comfortably admit."},{"Title":"By the Shores of Silver Lake","review":"By the Shores of Silver Lake, by Laura Ingalls WilderThe family had not fared will in Plum Creek. The plague of locusts destroyed their crops one year, and left debts and poor crops afterward. Game for meat was scarce. Aunt Docia visited with a job offer for Pa, but he must leave for a railroad camp in Dakota Territory. A homesteader could get 160 acres there, and hunting is better. Aunt Docia tells the family news from Wisconsin. Another chapter begins for the Ingalls family. Scarlet fever had struck the family, and Mary went blind. Good old faithful Jack expired. Pa left in the covered wagon, and Ma, Mary, Laura, Carrie, and Grace would follow by train. Laura tells Mary about their trains, its windows, and what can be seen. When they stop for dinner Laura is amazed by the railroad turntable. Pa spoke of the wonderful times they were living in. [The Age of Victoria saw many innovations that changed the world.] Pa came in the wagon to take them to their new home.Uncle Hi worked hard on the railroad all summer. But the company figured he owed them money (Chapter 5)! They are deeper in debt. Laura gets to ride one of the ponies. [Laura's description of the sights to Mary has trained her for journalism.] There was an enormous stillness on this prairie (p.60). They are surprised to find Uncle Henry and his family from the Big Woods of Wisconsin. Pa tells his family about the gambling and horse thieves in the railroad camp. One wonderful afternoon Laura goes with Pa to see them build the railroad. Men with plows break the prairie sod. Scrapers leveled the plowed strip. Low ground is filled in, high ground is cut through to make the grade level. This uses less fuel for the engines. Pa explained how the surveyors measured it all and marked the route.The paymaster delivers the cash to Pa, who will distribute the money due to each worker. Pa now carries a revolver for protection against robbers. Some of the men don't like being paid for only the first two weeks (Chapter 11). There is trouble at another work camp. But work ends for the winter, and everyone leaves. Pa gets the caretaker's job so the family can stay at Silver Lake and live in the Surveyor's House. It is so quiet there you can hear a wolf howl nearby. Visitors come for Christmas, and they feast (Chapter 21). The Reverend Alden also shows up; he will start his church. The warm March weather brings many men who come to settle and claim homesteads. Pa is able to file his claim on the land he wants. But the many people who settle there change the environment. The animals and birds stay away and Pa can't hunt.There are signs of Laura's maturity. We read about thefts, robbery, and murder. The girls must lock their attic bedroom door when strange men are staying over (room and board), and are not allowed outside by dusk. Pa has a scuffle when registering his claim. When moving to their homestead they see a light wagon drawn by the finest horses in the county; those are the Wilder boys. They move into the little claim shanty. Laura helps Pa put tar paper on the shanty. Settlers must plant ten acres of trees on every section; they break the wind, shade in summer, and provide fuel for winter (p.220). Pa plants cottonwood trees grown from seeds around the shanty. Living near the Big Slough brought mosquitoes at dusk. The wetness that provided plentiful hay had a trade-off. And so the Ingalls settle where lately the buffalo roamed."},{"Title":"By the Shores of Silver Lake","review":"By the shores of Silver Lake, by Laura Ingalls Wilder, is about Larua's last move from Minnesota to South Dakota.

Mary, Laura's older sister, has lost her sight to scarlet fever, and Laura hopes that she will someday be able to attend a college for the blind. Although Laura works very hard she rarely complains. She enjoys singing with her father as he plays the fiddle. Ingall's gives clear pictures of what life was like for a girl growing up in early American History. As an adult this was my first experience reading one of Laura Ingalls Wilder's &quot;Little House&quot; books; I found it most informative and enjoyable. This book is a great way for children to learn what life was like during the pioneer era."},{"Title":"By the Shores of Silver Lake","review":"Any fan of LIW will love this book. I reread this almost every year!"},{"Title":"By the Shores of Silver Lake","review":"By the Shores of Silver Lake is a bit darker and more dangerous than the books preceding. It opens with the family recovering from the scarlet fever that took away Mary's eyesight, and with a surprise offer of a well-paying job for Pa at a railroad building camp. The difficulties of farming at Plum Creek and Pa's thirst for the road override Ma's wish for a permanent home, and the family is off again: Pa by wagon and Ma and the kids on the train. Railroads were brand new and a train trip was seen as quite risky, but the only way that Mary could make the journey.The railroad camp that eventually became the town of DeSmet, South Dakota, was a rough place filled with coarse men. The area was about to be opened up to homesteaders, and a boomtown was about to rise up from the prairie. Pa's job was to issue the men's paychecks every two weeks, a more dangerous occupation than it sounds. Ma spends much of the book worrying about exposing the girls to coarse language, drunkeness, and various other forms of heathenism. (Ma is really a bit of a prude, objecting even to Pa singing a song about a lucky horseshoe). Two men are killed, offstage, in the book and Pa gets into some close calls himself. As the land rush proceeds, Ma finds herself running a hotel for the men who come to settle the land. She really has no choice but to accomodate the travelers, and wisely begins to charge them for their meals and a space on the floor to sleep.There is also much in this book that is warm and lovely. Pa's tender gesture to Ma of bringing some trees to plant on the homestead. A happy and coindidental reunion with Reverend Alden, and his sweet suggestion that Mary might someday attend college. Laura making a new and adventurous friend in her cousin Lena at the camp. And of course, Pa's reassurance to Laura that Jack will be happy in dog heaven. The family also takes delight in making special Christmas gifts for each other, and sweet Ma gives up something special of her own to make an unexpected Christmas houseguest happy. We also see Laura honing her storytelling talents as she becomes Mary's \\"eyes\\", trying earnestly to help her sister share in everything the family experiences.As with the other Little House books, the historical context of Silver Lake is rich and detailed. Excellent reading for children and adults."},{"Title":"By the Shores of Silver Lake","review":"Cherry Jones once again brings the characters from Laura's story to life in a unique way.I look for excuses to travel in my car just to be able to listen to another segment of the story!I have read all the books in the series, but I am discovering many aspects for the first time,simply by having them read aloud to me with such care.I bought the first set of CDs to try it out - then I couldn't get the rest of them quickly enoughto keep up with my renewed enthusiasm for the stories.My only regret is that one day, I WILL reach the end of my supply!Of course, I can wait a little while & then start listening all over again -but at the moment I am relishing the freshness that comes with each CD.They are, indeed, American classics - but even as an Australian, I see the universality of thesubject material, especially as read (& sung) by Cherry Jones.These stories are timeless and profound.My admiration for the family of Charles & Caroline Ingalls grows daily.They are absolutely still alive in these recordings - the voice, the music, the story.We get to know Laura and her family & friends a little better.I will probably always re-read the books with the voice of Cherry Jones in my head - this is a good thing!Thank You!"},{"Title":"By the Shores of Silver Lake","review":"I love Laura Ingalls Wilder as an author.

Makes my daily work commute quite enjoyable."},{"Title":"By the Shores of Silver Lake","review":"Laura Ingalls and her family have been living along the banks of Plum Creek for over five-years now. While the lovely town has a school that Laura and her sisters may attend, it lacks much else; and Pa has spent countless years trying to keep afloat, and stop himself, and his family, from succumbing to death. Which is why Pa believes that moving West to Dakota Territory, is the best way to keep a roof over his family's head. Laura, couldn't be happier. As opposed to the rest of her family, which is content in living like a caterpillar, wrapped up in a cocoon; Laura is more like a butterfly, spreading her wings, and wanting to explore the world around her. And when they pick up their belongings and head West, that's exactly what she finally gets to do.Now almost thirteen-years-old, Laura is no longer given the privilege of simply frolicking around throughout the day. Instead, she must help Ma prepare food, and look after the little ones. But the little ones aren't the only people who need looking after. The family was recently struck with a bout of scarlet fever, and while everyone manage to pull through, Mary lost her sight from the sickness, and must be handled with kid gloves. Laura, however, doesn't mind. She will do anything she can to help Mary adjust, and, just as Pa told her, she is Mary's eyes. Moving West is difficult with so many strikes against the Ingalls family, but things look up when Pa is offered a job as a bookkeeper, timekeeper, and shopkeeper. The job pays fifty dollars a month, and offers a homestead for the Ingalls family to reside in. Pa believes the job is a true blessing, and instantly scoops it up - looking forward to begin work, and find a new place for his family to live. But as they head towards De Smet, the Ingalls family realizes that they aren't the only ones heading West. With the lure of as much free land as you'd like, many people have decided to pack up and head to the warm West. While neighbors are welcome, the Ingalls family must watch their back, for many people are trying to steal the claim's of others, and if they're not careful, they could end up one of the families cast out of the rich new environment.While the previous LITTLE HOUSE ON THE PRAIRIE books displayed hardships for the Ingalls family, and the friends and neighbors around them, none can compare to the sadness that accompanies the Ingalls family within the pages of BY THE SHORES OF SILVER LAKE, as they must contend with Mary's newly acquired blindness. That issue alone casts a somber shadow over the entire story, however, it does not make things any less interesting. Even with her handicap, Mary keeps a bright smile on her face, and shows that nothing can stop her from helping her family survive - from sewing to knitting, and everything in between. Mary smiles in the face of adversity, and truly becomes a favorite character in this addition. Laura, on the other hand, has truly matured since the previous book, ON THE BANKS OF PLUM CREEK. While she is still as jovial and fun as always, she has more responsibilities at this time in her life, and steps up to the plate without complaint. The family, in general, is delightful to spend time with. The warm, coziness of their home, and the fact that there is always something scrumptious simmering away on the stove provide readers with a comfortable, familiar feeling; while, over time, the characters begin to feel like family members whom you can't help but root for. A story that settles into your heart from page one.Erika SoroccoFreelance Reviewer"},{"Title":"By the Shores of Silver Lake","review":"Timeless book series.

So Pa said that he would go with Aunt Docia and Ma, Mary, Laura, Carrie, and Grace would come on the train when Mary got strong enough. She was blind. Ma and the girls went by train to a little depot. Pa was not there yet to pick them up. But he got there after supper.

The plague of locusts destroyed their crops one year, and left debts and poor crops afterward. Game for meat was scarce. Aunt Docia visited with a job offer for Pa, but he must leave for a railroad camp in Dakota Territory. A homesteader could get 160 acres there, and hunting is better. Aunt Docia tells the family news from Wisconsin. Another chapter begins for the Ingalls family. Scarlet fever had struck the family, and Mary went blind. Good old faithful Jack expired. Pa left in the covered wagon, and Ma, Mary, Laura, Carrie, and Grace would follow by train. Laura tells Mary about their trains, its windows, and what can be seen. When they stop for dinner Laura is amazed by the railroad turntable. Pa spoke of the wonderful times they were living in. [The Age of Victoria saw many innovations that changed the world.] Pa came in the wagon to take them to their new home.Uncle Hi worked hard on the railroad all summer. But the company figured he owed them money (Chapter 5)! They are deeper in debt. Laura gets to ride one of the ponies. [Laura's description of the sights to Mary has trained her for journalism.] There was an enormous stillness on this prairie (p.60). They are surprised to find Uncle Henry and his family from the Big Woods of Wisconsin. Pa tells his family about the gambling and horse thieves in the railroad camp. One wonderful afternoon Laura goes with Pa to see them build the railroad. Men with plows break the prairie sod. Scrapers leveled the plowed strip. Low ground is filled in, high ground is cut through to make the grade level. This uses less fuel for the engines. Pa explained how the surveyors measured it all and marked the route.The paymaster delivers the cash to Pa, who will distribute the money due to each worker. Pa now carries a revolver for protection against robbers. Some of the men don't like being paid for only the first two weeks (Chapter 11). There is trouble at another work camp. But work ends for the winter, and everyone leaves. Pa gets the caretaker's job so the family can stay at Silver Lake and live in the Surveyor's House. It is so quiet there you can hear a wolf howl nearby. Visitors come for Christmas, and they feast (Chapter 21). The Reverend Alden also shows up; he will start his church. The warm March weather brings many men who come to settle and claim homesteads. Pa is able to file his claim on the land he wants. But the many people who settle there change the environment. The animals and birds stay away and Pa can't hunt.There are signs of Laura's maturity. We read about thefts, robbery, and murder. The girls must lock their attic bedroom door when strange men are staying over (room and board), and are not allowed outside by dusk. Pa has a scuffle when registering his claim. When moving to their homestead they see a light wagon drawn by the finest horses in the county; those are the Wilder boys. They move into the little claim shanty. Laura helps Pa put tar paper on the shanty. Settlers must plant ten acres of trees on every section; they break the wind, shade in summer, and provide fuel for winter (p.220). Pa plants cottonwood trees grown from seeds around the shanty. Living near the Big Slough brought mosquitoes at dusk. The wetness that provided plentiful hay had a trade-off. And so the Ingalls settle where lately the buffalo roamed."},{"Title":"By the Shores of Silver Lake","review":"IT IS VERY GOOD. I LIKED IT BECAUSE THEY SURVIVE OFF ALMOST NOTHING. THEY TRAP AND KILL THEIR MEAT."},{"Title":"By the Shores of Silver Lake","review":"In this next book in the landmark &quot;Little House&quot; series, the Ingalls family decide to leave their farm by Plum Creek to find a new homestead on the prairie. The grasshoppers and poor crops in Minnesota were a little too much for them. In addition, some bad times appear for the Ingalls family in the time period between this and the previous book in the series. The whole family had been stricken with scarlet fever and the oldest daughter, Mary, is now blind because of it. In addition, although it is never mentioned in the books, Laura had a little baby brother at this time (Charles Frederic, \\"Freddy\\") who died before his first birthday (1875-1876). And, a new baby sister has been added to the family, Grace Pearl Ingalls (1877-1941). Laura's father gets a job acting as a storekeeper for the Chicago and North Western Railroad who are laying tracks through the Dakota terretory. While working for them, he finds a new homestead on the prairie and brings the rest of his family out. There is concern as to whether he will be able to file his claim on time; but, he does. The Ingalls family are among the first to live near the new town of De Smet, South Dakota (although South Dakota doesn't become a state until 1889). The time frame of this book is 1879-1880 and Laura Elizabeth Ingalls is 12-13 years old. The book was a 1940 Newbery Honor Book (that is, a runner-up to the Medal winner) for best contribution to American children's literature. And, it deserved it! Near the end of the book, Laura gets her first glimpse at the boy who will later become her husband, Almanzo Wilder."},{"Title":"By the Shores of Silver Lake","review":"Laura Ingalls Wilder described to us what we never would see--the building of railroads and towns right before her eyes. Her ability to describe makes you see the railroad being built in your own mind. This book really captures the emotions of growing up. From losing Jack, the brindle bulldog, to Mary's blindness to the hardships of no money. Laura struggles with the longing of wanting to keep going west but knows it can never happen. By being able to stay in the Surveyors House, they do not have to go back east but stay as far in the west as Laura feels she'll always be. The part where Carrie and Laura follow the moonbeam, while skating on the ice, made me appreciate the long cold winters here in the North. She appreciated all things wild and saw the beauty in the night. When they moved to the homestead, you could feel the heartache of knowing that was it for traveling in the wagon. You can feel the boredom in Laura while she is with Lena. Not that Lena was boring to Laura, but Laura saw Lena as someone who had so much freedom and would always be following the railroad while Laura would always be right where she is at. Little did Laura know that when she saw the beautiful brown Morgan horses, they and the young man driving them, would be her future."},{"Title":"By the Shores of Silver Lake","review":"I liked the book because it was interesting the way Laura described everything to Mary because she was blind. I liked when Laura went horseback riding. It sounded fun. My Mom read these books when she was young and back then this was her least favorite when when she re-read it as an adult she found it much more interesting. Now she is reading the series to me. It was sad when Jack died. I cried because I liked Jack. Pa said he would go to dog heaven. Mom's favorite part of the book was when the family lived in the surveyor's house for the winter and they had a nice Christmas with the Boasts, and she liked the part when the family learned about the blind college, and they had hope that Mary could one day go there."},{"Title":"By the Shores of Silver Lake","review":"When the book starts out, Laura's aunt comes, and Pa decides to move. Laura is 13. I really like this book because Laura puts detail in what pioneer life was like. It is a well-written book. You just can't miss a book like this."},{"Title":"By the Shores of Silver Lake","review":"The adventures of Laura Ingalls and her family continue as they move from their house by Plum Creek to the wilderness of the unsettled Dakota Territory. Aunt Docia visits the family to offer Pa a job working for the Chicago and North Western Railroad who are laying tracks throughout South Dakota. Grasshoppers destroyed all their crops and hunting was scarce. Also the family had been stricken with scarlet fever, and also caused Laura's sister, Mary, to go blind. Mary does not complain about being blind and she is very brave. Many times Laura tells her details about their new life out in the wilderness and on the train rides. The Ingalls's bulldog Jack died of old age. He was a great companion to the family and is terribly missed.While working for the railroad company, Pa finds a new homestead on the prairie and brings out the rest of his family. This is Laura's first time riding on a train. Also, the Ingalls's covered-wagon travels are finally over. Then Pa puts up the very first building in what will soon be a new town called De Smet.One night, Laura and Carrie take a walk in their new town and come face to face with a pack of wolves. They are chase by them, but luckily Pa was there with his shotgun and shot the wolves, and saved their lives.This book is definitely one of the most important books of this series, and I highly recommend it to everyone. It is very fun, exciting, and adventurous.(...)"},{"Title":"By the Shores of Silver Lake","review":"In this story, Laura and her family settle in the Dakota territory where Pa must work with a railroad company. Due to the railroad, a little town begins to sprout up around them. Now the pioneering family must decide whether to move on or become part of the town. This story is one of tragedy, triumph, and human spirit. A must for every child's library."},{"Title":"By the Shores of Silver Lake","review":"This fifth book in the Little House series relates Laura's memories as a young teenage girl, as her family is on the move yet again: from Plum Creek to Silver Lake and town yet to be built. Eager to find \\"the real west\\" Laura struggles with the chores of a prairie woman while inside she longs to rush headlong into the new landscape with childlike enthusiasm. Pa's cheerful fiddle music and Ma's quiet maternal authority provide a warm, stable foundation for family life--whether in the big woods, in a bustling town or on the wide prairie.Ma longs to settle down for good--not just because she craves social stability, but she wants to provide real schooling for her young daughters, two of whom she hopes to groom as future teachers.Laura--known affectionately as \\"Half Pint\\" and \\"Flutterbudget\\" by her merry Pa--recognizes her gypsy nature; like Charles Ingalls she eagerly longs for new adventures westward. Can she settle into future town of De Smet?Blinded as a result of scarlet fever Mary, the oldest, is reduced to holding 2-year old Grace in a rocker for most of the book, though she quietly reprimands Laura's grammar, ideas and behavior. Carrie is half child-half girl, almost forgotten in the middle, who both needs and gives care. She has a choice of role models to observe in her two older sisters. The family faces many challenges on the prairie wilderness and unsettled territory: a railroad riot on payday, horse thieves, wolves, an onslaught of spring rushers, murderous claim jumpers and a lost baby.But this family enjoys many good times as well with warm, music-filled evenings by the fire. They use their talents and ingenuity to provide each other with precious Christmas gifts even without out a tree. Basic hospitality is sometimes strained, but an undercurrent of Christian obligation pervades. They are blessed by the loyalty of old friends like Mr. Edwards, and new friends like Mr. and Mrs. Boast. Combined with Garth William's charming pen and ink illustrations this book continues the saga of the lively, pigtailed girl from the Big Woods, who shared her life story with 20th century America--reinforcing the importance of traditional family values."},{"Title":"By the Shores of Silver Lake","review":"This is the fifth of nine books in the \\"Little House\\" historical fiction series by Laura Ingalls Wilder. The book starts with the news, in the first chapter, that Laura's older sister Mary has gone blind. The information is related matter-of-factly, \\"Her blue eyes were still beautiful, but they did not know what was before them, and Mary herself could never look through them again to tell Laura what she was thinking without saying a word.\\" (p. 2)Laura has to become Mary's eyes and see for her, describing in detail what she is seeing so that Mary, too, can \\"see.\\" The perceptive reader understands how central this experience, this role, was in shaping the future author of this series of books which are enduring across generations of readers, young and old.Much later in the book, in the chapter, \\"On the Pilgrim Way,\\" a much beloved, Reverend Alden is visiting, passing through with a very young (boy preacher) Reverend Stuart, and has just said to Ma, \\"I am sorry indeed, Sister Ingalls, to see the affliction that has come to Mary.\\"The reply comes, \\"Yes, Brother Alden,\\" Ma answered sadly, \\"Sometimes it is hard to be resigned to God's will. We all had the scarlet fever in our place on Plum Creek, and for a while it was hard to get along. But I'm thankful that all the children were spared to us. Mary is a great comfort to me, Brother Alden. She has never once repined.\\"Brother Alden extends encouragement and comfort, \\"Mary is a rare soul, and a lesson to all of us...We must remember that whom the Lord loveth, He chasteneth, and a brave spirit will turn all our afflictions to good. I don't know whether you and Brother Ingalls know that there are colleges for the blind. There is one in Iowa.\\"The account continues, \\"Ma took tight hold of the edge of the dishpan. Her face startled Laura. Her gentle voice sounded choked and hungry. She asked, 'How much does it cost?'\\"In this book, perhaps more than the other books in the series, the author develops the subtleties of what the Ingalls family is all about, the close interrelationships of its members, their self-sacrificing devotion to one another. With the news that there are colleges for the blind, Laura determines to work hard so that the family can afford to send Mary to one, a theme that carries throughout other books in the series.The author does a nice job of developing the central characters, especially Mary, whose blindness does not in any manner stop her from being a valuable, contributing member of the family. For example, it is Mary who warms and entertains baby Grace on her lap in the rocking chair by the fire, a repeated sweet scene.Mary is mentally sharp and keeps the free-spirited, free-wheeling Laura on her toes, particularly when it comes to being truthful and describing accurately what she (Laura) is seeing. When Laura tells her the road in front of them has disappeared, Mary objects, saying that is impossible. Laura struggles to explain. In the chapter, \\"The Shanty on the Claim,\\" Laura describes the shanty, which is papered with black tar paper fastened with yellow lath strips as \\"tiger-striped.\\" Mary corrects her and points out that tigers are yellow with black stripes.Laura gets her first glimpse of her future husband Almanzo Wilder, who along with his older brother Royal, passes the Ingalls family, the Wilder boys standing in a wagon, driving a beautiful, matched set of horses. Laura's attention is consumed completely by the beautiful horses, and she seems to scarcely notice the young men.We cover this series, as well as the prequel series (The Martha Years, The Charlotte Years, The Caroline Years) and the sequel series (The Rose Years) in our home school curriculum with my grandchildren, who are currently 11, 8 and 6. My grandson enjoys the books at least as much as my granddaughters."},{"Title":"By the Shores of Silver Lake","review":"This book is by Laura Ingalls Wilder. The story is about Laura, her older sister Mary, her two little sisters Carrie and Grace, and Ma and Pa, who are their mom and dad. They move from one place to the next. The setting is 19th century trail and shows a lot of trees, wagons, and people too.One of the main events is when Mary, Carrie, Grace and Ma get Scarlet Fever and Mary went blind. Another is when Jack was their dog and he died of old age.The author is telling about her life when she was a little girl. She is Laura. I think my favorite part of the book is when Laura and Lena were riding horses in Lena's backyard. The book starts when Mary goes blind. Some of it is sad, some of it is happy, and some of it is just right. I think everyone could like this book if they really wanted to.- Emma,9"},{"Title":"By the Shores of Silver Lake","review":"Plum Creek had seemed such a haven in the last book. After moving out of the Big Woods and the Prairie, Plum Creek apparently is no longer the right home for them anymore, thanks to poor crops and other junk in Minnesota. So onward they move!There were plenty of hard times not covered in this book, though just a couple of things were mentioned. There is a wider gap of years between this book and Plum Creek than with the other books, I guess Laura Wilder didn't want to write out about these harsh events, not that I can blame her. Mary is now blind due to a bout of scarlet fever that hit the family during the interim between Plum Creek and this book. Another child (Grace) has been born, but what is not mentioned in the book is that there was another child (Charles) born in 1875 but he died before his first birthday.So this book begins after this has all happened and Pa finds a new job and homestead so he can bring out his family, Laura's just becoming a woman (12-13 years old) as she returns to life on the prairie, which is very different to the way that pretty much all Americans live today, as there was a lot of isolation due to the low amount of people. Wow, life was hard back then but they managed! Overall this is a solid book in a wonderful series."},{"Title":"Death on the installment plan, (A New Directions book)","review":"'Death On The Installment Plan' is a raging animal of a novel that eclipses even Celine's own 'Journey' (though, it must be said, not by much). Structurally it's a shambles, but the unbelievable energy behind each & every sentence is enough to propel the reader straight through the 600-odd pages. What few of the other reviews have pointed out is how gut-bustingly funny this book is. A laugh a line with Celine and no mistake...More than that, 'Death...' contains absolutely the funniest sex scene ever written, bar none. While 'Journey' is tighter and harsher and the later works are more crazily surreal, 'Death...' is the shot of pure Celine that literature needed when it was first published and which the literate world could use another dose of now. And that's no Cambridge lie."},{"Title":"Death on the installment plan, (A New Directions book)","review":"First, let me ask you: have you read 'Journey to the End of the Night'? If the answer is yes (and if you liked it) then my response to you is go ahead and read Death. Death is very similar to Journey, only Death takes place earlier in the life of Celine/Bardamu.Plot (yes, there is one...kinda):The book begins with a grown Bardamu, practicing medicine in the suburbs of Paris. Soon the action flashes back to his childhood, which is what the rest of the book is about. Like Journey, this book follows the narrator as he moves around to various destinations, including a number of apprenticeships in Paris, boarding school in England, and a farm. There are developed characters besides Bardamu; there are his parents, his uncle, and (best of all) a crazy Inventor who takes young Bardamu under his wing.It was Bukowski who pointed me towards Celine. He praised Journey, but he said nothing about Death. Death was unavailable to me, and after I was done with Journey I tried to read Guignol's Band. I couldn't read it though due to the frequent incoherent streamofconscious rants (and perhaps because it wasn't a Manheim Translation). But then I moved and found Death on Credit (same...Credit is just the UK title, whereas it's installment plan in US), read it, and liked it even better than Journey. There are one or two short parts of surreal/hallucinatory sequences. Even those are short; 98% of the book I would describe as concrete events written coherently.Celine has changed his style a little with his second book. Ellipses are used much more often here than they were in Journey. But I found this to work quite well, both in terms of readability, and in terms of emulating actual speech and thoughts. Also, there are no chapters in Death.Every thing else is what you'd expect from Celine after reading Journey. The bipolar nature of the work--it will make you laugh, then twenty pages later you'll be crying. There's plenty of humor. There's plenty of sexual escapades. Plenty of other little adventures that you'll enjoy reading about.Oh yeah...also, there is less blatant philosophizing in this book. In Journey he'd go off on a rant about how people are terrible, and how society is evil, and how he believes in nothing. Don't worry! Those themes/ideas are all present here, he just doesn't come out and say it, rather, he shows them.So...if you've read Journey and liked it, I strongly suggest you read Death.If you haven't read Journey to the End of the Night, I suggest reading that first. It's not completely necessary. I think that you'll enjoy this book more if you've read Journey. Journey is perhaps the more readable of the two (at least the more traditionally readable). But if you want to read this and then do Journey be my guest, let me know how it goes."},{"Title":"Death on the installment plan, (A New Directions book)","review":"Dr. Destouches, Louis-Ferdinand, whatever you want to call him, this man is the essence of 20th century spleen, frenetic overkill, hyperbolic, high-velocity anathema. He covers all the bases. Nothing is sacred. Everything known to man and then some is fair game for his unhomogynized, vituperative rants. And yet it is not hatred of mankind that informs his venting, it is a weird kind of love. Dr. Destouches was actually a man who would not turn down a poor patient. He had a sincere love for his wife and for his cat. He is the preeminent 20th century answer to Swift and to Pope. He holds mankind up to ridicule. He lambasts the foibles and the rot of civilization. Yet he also displays vestiges of love and of understanding beneath the ravings. He abhors the human condition, yet strangely sympathizes with its common plight. We are all actors in a ridiculous farce. Life is indeed a tale told by an idiot, signifying nothing, but we are brother actors, victims of central-casting. There has never before been, nor will there ever again be, such energy displayed upon a page. The man had a vision of hell on earth and was never affronted by it. He was always willing to laugh in response to the pain. His is the consummate howl, the absurd grin, the &quot;barbaric yawp.&quot;"},{"Title":"Death on the installment plan, (A New Directions book)","review":"I'm not sure if you're supposed to read this book or Journey to the End of the Night first, I have a feeling that one is a continuation of the other but it doesn't really seem to make any kind of difference. The other book I think might be more of Ferdinand's experiences in the war and as a doctor, while this book deals more with his childhood. It can get confusing actually because the story starts off with Ferdinand as an adult and then without warning switches over to his childhood. The novel then mostly follows his growing up and the various stages of his life, growing up kind of poor in Paris, then going to England for schooling and finally being apprenticed to this quasi-crazy inventor/balloon operator/con artist fellow. This is a funny book but not a happy book, both disdain and love for humanity crackle off the pages and Celine's prose is blunt in its eloquence. His style is bracing today and must have seemed bizarre back when the book was first published, having had most of a century of post-modern writing his techniques don't seem as off-putting as they must have originally but his constant use of ellipses is actually a crucial part of the novel. I think earlier translation had taken them out but they need to be here because they set the pace for the reader, forcing you to pause right when he wants to (Pynchon did the same thing in Gravity's Rainbow and I wouldn't be surprised if this novel gave him the idea) and giving the sentences a broken, staccato feel, somewhere between a crazy man ranting at you and a very intense friend sitting across the table from you telling you exactly how it is and how it's going to be. It doesn't hurt that Celine holds nothing back, his feelings are poured out onto the paper, at no point do you really have to ask, \\"So tell me, how do you really feel?\\" because it's all there. He rages at life, at people, at the world in general in the most excoriating language that the printed page can hold, no swearword is left unspoken, no coarse description left untouched. Everyone in the world hates him and he hates them back, the words coming in clusters, like he's spitting them out through clenched teeth. The situations range from being darkly depressing to darkly hilarious (sometimes both, especially in the scene where one character offs himself) and there sure isn't a lot of hugging going on but Celine is being so honest about the human condition that you don't really mind. And when he goes to get poetic, he manages to take the blunt language and turn it into something grand, a ragged plea for things to not be the way they are. No matter how terrible things get for Ferdinand, no matter what life piles on top of him, he forges onward anyway, spitting and screaming but he never gives up and he never slows down, using the words as a scythe to cut his way through it all. By turns tragic and comic, bawdy and touching, blunt and subtle, it's a big book and a lot to slog through but reading it in small chunks so as to absorb it better is probably the best way to go about it. Not for the faint of heart but those willing to dive into it will find that the rewards are pretty decent."},{"Title":"Death on the installment plan, (A New Directions book)","review":"This is, quite simply, the best novel I've ever read (and I've read quite a few). At times hilarious, at other times poignant to the point of inducing tears, this book is a roller-coaster ride through the range of human emotions, human foibles, human triumphs. There's more insight on every page here than in most full novels. Far better than &quot;Journey to the End of Night.&quot; A masterpiece. (Read ONLY the Manheim translation.)"},{"Title":"Death on the installment plan, (A New Directions book)","review":"The greatest novel of one of the greatest novelists of all time.You would have to write a book longer than Celine's novel to do any justice to analyzing it. Thus I was shocked to find the Wikipedia article about this book was about five sentences long. I dropped what I was doing and spouted off a slightly-edited paragraph about the themes of the novel. It's a flawed and cursory view of a book that is difficult to put into words, but I'll offer it here.\\"It offers a profound vision of the nature of individual human existence: rooted in loneliness, pettiness, and inertia. The antiheroic genius of Bardamu's search for a livable life in early 20th century Paris forms a direct literary metaphor for modern humanity: to search and search again for happiness and meaning in a complex world and to oftentimes come up empty. Or more precisely: to find words, stories, experiences, and ideas that stretch the boundaries of consciousness while providing little or no structure with which to assign any meaning to life as a whole. Life becomes merely a subjective personal experience in the midst of madness and savagery: beautiful in itself but with overtones of profound suffering and a lack of moral prerogatives, and at the mercy of the strange human forces that are both within and without. We become our own history, and our own suffering, and as as such we live: accumulating the pain, happiness, confusion, and death that life allows us to have on installment. Even if it will all be repossessed at the end, when it becomes less than a dream. And that is a moment we all live for.\\"The modern world belongs to Celine. As it more closely conforms to his vision of a future with little hope, a past with veiled lies and atrocities, and an incredible yet painful and ephemeral present, we see that his vision has only become stronger when referring to the world beyond his immediate comprehension or even prediction.This is a fascinating work of art by a writer at the height of his powers. It belongs on the bookshelf of anyone who has ever cared about the realities of human existence."},{"Title":"Death on the installment plan, (A New Directions book)","review":"Everyone who is something in the 20th century writing, has crawled fromunder the master's long overcoat (from Queneau to Thomas Bernhard).

Yet as brittle and tragicas anything out of Euripides or Aeschylus."},{"Title":"Death on the installment plan, (A New Directions book)","review":"I did not like this book much. I even hate it, and probably would not read it again.But I admit it. I laughed at some of the quirky passages and occurrences, but not at the book itself. DoIP is very vitriolic and vituperative; it is very caustic and corrosive. Beneath its acerbic nature and dark humor, though, lies a very pertinent reflection of the lower depths of reality and man. And although Celine was not one who you would call positive, his book still has that glint of idealism, that belief of happiness, that belief in the virtues that some men possess. Amidst the score of idiots and devils in the novel are some people trying to be scrupulous and generally good even while wallowing in the maw of evil surrounding them.DoIP is Ferdinand's bildungsroman, a story of his development, and of his persistence to live amidst a brew of difficultiespervading in his life. Of course he has degraded morally, emotionally, mentally and spiritually in the course of the novel;but what would you have expected with his circumstances? In the end, though,we see that he is just a child trying to live inthe reality of the world, in pain and in suffering. Yet amidst this he manages to persist, to live, and this is whatultimately Celine tries to preach in his novel (as I have seen it): that one should persist amidst the difficulties, that oneshould live amidst the pain entrenching them, that one should live amidst everything.This may be a dark book, but it has something that light-hearted books could probably never portray: the truth."},{"Title":"Death on the installment plan, (A New Directions book)","review":"Really there is very little to say other than I read it every couple of years and still find other fiction wanting compared to it.

Underneath all his mis- this and anti-that is novel full of deep understanding, forgiveness and love of humanity."},{"Title":"Death on the installment plan, (A New Directions book)","review":"Well, its been about half a century since old Ferdinand croaked and he's still viewed as a contentious devil. There's not too much doubt about his enduring position in French literature (supposedly, he's the most read French author after Proust), but his odious anti-Jewish and pro-Fascist proclivities were fully indulged in during the war years and, as a result, C&eacute;line's ass was booted from the pantheon. So, as for his inclusion in the current \\"liste des c&eacute;l&eacute;brations nationales\\"...pas encore mon vieux!!C&eacute;line made his literary mark with his first book, \\"Journey to the End of the Night\\" which was a biographical work, though considerably embellished. Due to its lacerating prose and profligate use of des mauvais mots (gasp!) proper French literary society was taken aback. The follow-through was \\"Death on the Installment Plan\\" (\\"Mort &agrave; cr&eacute;dit\\"). If inclusion in \\"the List\\" was based on the use of ellipses...well, old C&eacute;line would have it... made! Nonetheless, the author's footprints are, so to speak, on every book by Bukowski and plenty of other modern masters, too.In brief, C&eacute;line's book can be divided essentially in half. In the first part, the young d&eacute;bauch&eacute; suffers mightily at the hands of his petty bourgeoise parents. He languishes in their shop...screws up in school...offends the neighbors...creates mayhem...doesn't say much...is sent to school in England to learn the language (he doesn't)...has many absurd adventures...lazes about (a louche character, indeed!)...moves in with a comical inventor (and self-proclaimed polymath)...has many other sordid, bizarre and absurd adventures...and that's it. Clearly, the intent of both books (\\"Journey\\" and \\"Death\\") is to present a somewhat unstructured (but not \\"steam of consciousness\\") presentation. That device is intended to convey the emptiness of the search for meaning in life as is lack of any evidence of agency by the protagonist, Ferdinand. The young Ferdinand is meant to be a symbol of the helplessness of the individual at the mercy of strange internal and external forces.\\"Death\\" is overly long and could have benefited from judicious editing. This would have been a really punchy read at around 400 pages as opposed to the nearly 600 in the Manheim translation. While I am very fond of \\"Journey\\" and equally taken with \\"North\\", \\"Castle to Castle\\" and \\"Rigadoon\\", it seems to me that C&eacute;line capitalized on the \\"Journey\\" theme and its success and created a derivative work in \\"Death\\". That's not to say \\"Death\\" isn't worth reading, rather I'd recommend starting with the others first.So...anyway...\\"Death\\" is another installment (pun intended) in the anti-hero life of Ferdinand/C&eacute;line. Life does stink...there's little we can do about it...there's not much meaning...and I suspect the reader will know all that by page 300. \\"Journey\\" conveys the same message...but adds much useful detail on C&eacute;line himself and his other career (physician). I found his nasty characterizations of patients in \\"Journey\\" particularly engaging and the development of secondary characters much more complete, to the point where the reader develops sympathy with their plights and disgust for modern (well, 1930s) French society. Not so in \\"Death\\"."},{"Title":"Death on the installment plan, (A New Directions book)","review":"I concede two stars to this book only because I assume that I read a bad translation. Celine certainly shouldn't be criticized because I can't read French when there are so many other good reasons to criticize him! I've heard Celine's influence on Bukowski commented on several times, and I can only assume that this is because of Bukowski's admission of having read Celine, since the two authors are connected in no other way. Whereas Bukowski's HAM ON RYE is a timeless exploration of what it means to be a youth in America, Celine resorts to self-pitying and annoying drivel. Celine displays none of the youthful self-examination that lends beauty to the horrible events of Bukowski's life. Instead, all misfortune is blamed on those Celine comes in contact with, begging the question: If all of the characters are horrible thieves and liars and the author/narrator is a whining, sniveling self-apologist, then where is the sympathy of the reader to reside? It is because of this lack of compassion with the people of the book that interest is lost quicly.

The book is a murderously grim yet fanciful and at times hilarious account of the author's growing up in a Paris slum, then going to boarding school in England, then finally apprenticing to a baloonist and inventor in the years before the First World War.

Here we find more auto-bio text, this time concerning Celine's childhood, but as with &quot;Journey&quot; it is assumable that much of this was symbolic. Celine's descriptions of his family, his schooling, his brief career in jewelry sales, and his appreticeship for a mad genius are all so eloquently written as to bring tears. Each character is full and rich, and each motive is perfectly carried out. Superbly essential reading for anyone interested in what makes humans tick"},{"Title":"Death on the installment plan, (A New Directions book)","review":"I find Celine's stuff difficult to get through without losing the very little sanity and serenity that I've struggled to hold on to my whole life. Misanthropic readers, beware...you may find yourselves even more enraged by the 'idiocy of society' during and after reading Death On the Installment Plan (that goes for the rest of his novels as well. Although progressively, his novels lose their power to build up your hatred for humanity while making up for that evaporating pot of piss by amplifying their power to drive you to the brink of madness)...Now to address/warn all the happy-go-luckies...If you're looking for a story that holds even the slightest bit of optimism, you should disregard Death On the Installment Plan.It's a near 600-page novel so a whole hell of a lot happens, but there is one thing that remains consistent throughout: the futility of life. It's the semi-autobiographical story of a boy growing up in France among an impoverished family that sees him as nothing short of an incorrigible pest. It seems like the gods conspire to work against our protagonist, Ferdinand, as he struggles through his childhood years, trying his best to please his parents, but always falling short. Ferdinand learns, at a very young age, to keep his mouth shut for the better, but at times what seems like for the worse. In that sense he reminds me of Charles Bukowski's alter-ego, Henry Chinaski; both seem to keep to themselves because, in both their situations, speaking out doesn't seem to do any good.Bukowski spoke highly of almost no other writer than himself, with Celine being one of the very few exceptions (and for a good reason too).

No one quite knew whether he was a monster or a genius. He began his vitriolic attacks in his first novel, 'Journey to the End of the Night', which was an instant success, continuing in a similar vein with 'Death on the Installment Plan', first published in 1936. Apparently bitter after being wounded in the head during the First World War, he stated: \\"I got it served up on a plate defending my country.\\" 'With his sliced phrases of poetry and muck, his choppy punctuation of exclamarion marks and triple dots, Celine succeeded in his attempt to make print gurgle to the inner ear, to set down the language of guts and tripes and deep festering hates.' Lacking any sense of modesty, he raved: \\"It's my genius, my stroke of genius ! not thirty six possible ways!...\\"He was entirely self-centred in his fantasies and annihilations, almost parodying Proust when he wrote, \\"I know something about the last century, I saw it depart. It disappeared along the road to Orly ...\\" Celine reserves his 'utter hatred' for all bosses. Although seeming to lean towards the left, readers failed to see the fascist implications and anti-semitism in his earlier writing. He had been classed at that time with Joyce and Kafka as one of the three most important writers of this century, but his political aberrations have diminished his stature since then -specifically due to his anti-semitism. 'As Gide pointed out, \\"how could anyone take seriously a man who accused Cezanne, Picasso, Maupassant, Racine, Stendahl and Zola of being Jews?\\" Celine was even too extreme for professional Jew baiters among the Nazis, and his books were banned in Germany. After the war the French authorities tried to extradite him from a Danish prison and execute him - but they failed. His last ten years were spent in Paris at Meudon. His death was announced on the same day as Hemingway's suicide. In short, Celine wanted the total destruction of humanity - and that remains his epitaph!Despite the despair and disillusionment inherent in everything he wrote, in all probability influenced by his wartime head wound, Louis-Ferdinand Celine's writing remains an important, if bizarre, contribution to world literature.The Learning Process: Some Creative Impressions"},{"Title":"Death on the installment plan, (A New Directions book)","review":"A constant humming in his ear (an old warwound from the First Worldwar...) drove C&eacute;line mad, as he says...

The portrait of the young Fernand's childhood in working-class Paris slums is shattering in its filth and despair, but one gets the feeling that the wily young scamp likes it that way. Death on the Installment Plan approaches the pain of sexual awakening, the struggle to make a living, and the need to leave a mark with a sly wink - after all, as the author subtly reminds us, the slate is wiped clean in the end"},{"Title":"Death on the installment plan, (A New Directions book)","review":"The subject's line meant as a compliment, for those who can take the frenetic style and unrelenting pace of this, his \\"prequel\\" to the more somber Journey to the Edge of Night. Because it deals with adolescence rather than the horrors to befall \\"Ferdinand\\" the author's alter ego in Journey, this book makes for a lighter and more entertaining read. The first half lists the smells and sights of the Passage where he grew, the toil for his parents and then working peddling the Gorloges' \\"manias of a whole insane asylum served up as trinkets\\", ensuing bad sex with the Madame G., off to England for a twist on the Dickensian orphan-cum-Edwardian schoolboy saga. Then, back to France for first Paris and then the sticks as Ferdinand works and swindles alongside the des Pereires couple. He's a mad scientist obsessed with tellurically grown tubers, she's a manic counterpart crazed by her own and her husband's hot air--in more ways than one.The pace moves this book very quickly. Compared to the later Castle by Castle, you can see in Death the origins of the elliptical, staccato style of his later, post-WWII novels. Yet, lacking the despair if not the pessimism of the 1950s efforts, Death still carries a sassiness that makes it an easier read and less bitter to savor. Compared to the earlier Journey, the freshness of youth carries the reader more nimbly through the passages relating wonderfully the stench of being seasick, starving, pants full of excrement, stealing, and sexually randy. This book lacks the gravity of the other works by Celine, but would probably, more than Journey, be the place to start.Yes, the constant negativism does drag the book down if you're an optimist, but then, why would someone who always looks on the bright side of life be attracted to the dark side of comedy anyhow? The narrator, like the author, knows he's a jerk, little better than the rest of failed humanity. The hundreds of pages spent with Courtial des Pereires, in their manic schemes and unrestrained rhetoric, speak of the joy of the crazy dreams we all harbor and their manipulation by those just a bit more avaricious and crafty than the rest of us. The human comedy Celine sketches here, in riotious crowd scenes and gustatory excess being at his most accessible, makes for a spirited encounter with the world, just before 1914 changed it--and the narrator and his author--all again."},{"Title":"Death on the installment plan, (A New Directions book)","review":"This was Celine's second novel afterJourney to the End of the Night, and effectively acts as a prequel to his first novel, as this focuses on Ferdinand Bardamu's (Celine's fictional alter ego) troubled childhood and youth in Paris.What matters most, when you read Celine, is experiencing his incredibly intense emotional and intellectual viewpoint of his often desperate, existentialist, awful - and always unsolved - conundrum - of the human condition. From that, Celine wrote and described, there was - and is - no escape. Celine saw humanity as pathetic, disease-ridden, without hope; his only consolation was to grasp a few moments of joy in a life of poverty and hardship. It is a story that is powerfully told, and you can't help but be overwhelmed by it. His style of writing was also still regarded as revolutionary at the time this novel was published: in fact, its intensity, use of ellipses and often hallucinatory sequences written as matter of fact can only be compared to his first novel; there was, at the time in the 1930s, no one with whom to compare him or to match him for the depth, complexity and violence of his negativity in his impoverished world.At the same time as being drawn in and compromised by the narrator's viewpoint, anger and loathing about his life, his constantly argumentative father, his desperate situation, his own hatred of his poverty and the poor in general, you also can't forget that in real life Celine later qualified and practiced as a doctor in the poorest, most desperate neighbourhoods of Paris (which he writes about so effectively in Journey to the End of Night), and was himself effectively and always a persona non grata before and after his \\"profession\\"; and you are further troubled by knowing that, besides he also lost his reputation as a writer - shunned by the literati of Paris - in his own lifetime because of his fascistic views (even though in practising his medicine, he attended to everybody, irrespective of whether the person was Jewish or otherwise).And while Celine and Bardamu both hated \\"humanity\\", both were always specific, explicit and thankful for those few individuals that made a difference in their lives, including the wonderful characters of certain women, who plied the trade of prostitution, Violette, Lola (in 'Journey'), and others. It is a compelling novel, and in some ways is even darker and more troubling than his first, and most famous novel, but if you were impressed by 'Journey', you will be all the more so by this prequel."},{"Title":"Death on the installment plan, (A New Directions book)","review":"Andre Gide said of Celine, &quot;...he writes not about reality, but of the hallucinations which reality provokes&quot;...this is most evident in Mort, Celine takes us into his early bourgeois childhood and in so defines it as 'stale, petite and engaged with episodes of merde and vomit'...it's a hillarious romp through life's false mirror..."},{"Title":"Death on the installment plan, (A New Directions book)","review":"He kept my attention with his descriptions of every place he was in, how he felt about what was happening to him and what he thought about his surroundings."},{"Title":"Death on the installment plan, (A New Directions book)","review":"Still reading this but it is classic Celine.

His passages on a childhood filled with with petty soulessness ring true even in our time, and his never wavering cynicism reveals his most subtle quality; compassion, or, more accurately, an empathy for those who do not fit and yet struggle to live the best life they can under the immutable, spirit-crushing reality thay are born into. In a few words, a transcripted nightmare we all share. A wothy companion to &quot;Journey&quot;, although its long-windedness makes it salighty inferior. And that's still a high compliment.

He is happily married to Helga and they have a delightful four year old daughter. He works as the chief internal auditor at Banhaus Wertham &amp; Co. where he is very highly regarded by the Werthan family that owns the bank. Franz feels pretty good about himself also since he stepped in to defend a Jew attacked by Nazis three years ago at the cost of an eye though he swears he holds no grudges against the Nazis.Franz's life changes when the Nazi Party deposits large sums of cash at Banhaus Wertham &amp; Co. with the demand that anyone with the slightest Jewish blood be fired as the law states. Half-Jewish Fraulein Dressler, competent secretary to the bank's general director, will have to be released. Upset over the injustice, Franz decides to help Dressler while plotting to castigate Herr Dietrich, the Nazi mole just put inside the bank. Though the price of being caught could reach his beloved family, inactivity would cost Franz much more.This is an exhilarating historical tale that takes the reader back to a highly volatile and dangerous time to be a freedom lover. The story line is fantastic as it moves rather quickly forward yet provides fully developed characters whose behavior especially reactions during crisis are brilliantly rendered. However, the key to Marshall Browne's tale is Nazi Germany on the brink of World War II that comes so alive. Author of the well written police Inspector Anders tales Mr. Browne's latest work will be on everyone's short list for the genre's best novel of the year.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Eye of the Abyss (Franz Schmidt, 1)","review":"In the foreboding atmosphere of 1938 Germany, Franz Schmidt is a quiet, contented family man, proud of his Teutonic heritage, and chief auditor at Wertheim's, a venerable commercial bank that has just landed a major Nazi Party account. He's also a man who lost an eye three years earlier defending a Jew.As in Australian author Browne's Italian Inspector Anders novels (\\"Inspector Anders and the Ship of Fools,\\" \\"The Wooden Leg of Inspector Anders\\") the pace is deliberate, the protagonist deliberating. The tension builds by increments as the enormity of the bank's move into Nazi business becomes clear to the hapless bankers.Nazi functionary Dietrich, attached to the bank, quickly homes in on Lilli Dressler, the director's Jewish secretary. As Jews have been barred from banking, Dietrich arranges to have the Gestapo arrest her. Schmidt and Lilli's boss separately attempt to save her, and when their illegal efforts fail, Dietrich is exultant. Magnanimously sparing the men from prosecution, Dietrich has them where he wants them.In chilling increments it becomes clear that every aspect of privacy - from phone lines to family relationships, personal friendships and private histories - is compromised. Dietrich seems omnipresent. Heartsick, Schmidt's resolution hardens into a daring plan of heroism and revenge.Browne has captured the Nazis' fanatical mania for control, their mastery of detail and intimidation, their paranoia and arrogance. Schmidt's complexities reveal a tangle of motivations, not all of which he understands, or admires in himself. Events build, from the first slow tightening of the noose to a choking breathlessness. A masterful thriller, as intelligent as it is dark."},{"Title":"The Eye of the Abyss (Franz Schmidt, 1)","review":"Writing a novel is like a document of consciousnes, and since conscious today USA, is not like the conscious of Germany's Weimar Republic of 1938, can we have a truly realistic novel of the times? Unfortunately, today USA is very much like the early Weimar Republic. The Reichstag Fire is like September 11th. The laws of The Patriot Act are like the laws & practices being implemented in Hitler's early Germany for their Homeland Security. Their special channel(s) is a phrase not only becomming familiar with the Herr Franz Schmidt of 1938, but those today familiar with the official lies leading the USA into Iraq & Afghanistan.Still, the above is all but background to the real story being told: THE STEALING FROM THE BANKS BY THE NAZI PARTY.I couldn't help but think, as I was reading this novel, about the crooked members of the Republican Party of Bush(Savings & Loan, the elder/Treasury, the younger) and the subsequent crooks of the Obama Democratic Party(Larry Summers, Henry Paulson, etc.).In the novel there are a few good people who try to put the criminal Nazis at task & at each others throats, to foil some of their vast looting enterprises. I'd like to think their are some Franz Schmidts today in our mists, working to bring current criminals, not only to light, but to jail. So far, we've bailed out the crooks & given them billions of dollars in bonuses.At least in 1938, a few of the criminal came to their judgement day.So, in short, reading this novel was like reading a parallel 1938/2010 looting extravaganza(imagination?).One story has been told, the looting of the Weimar Republic of Germany.Still, I can't wait for the parallel/other to end.Either they will stop stealing & looting, or like Russia, an end...?P.S. google: Keiser Report 68: Aug 12, 2010"},{"Title":"Getting Rich in America","review":"Brian Tracy is an excellent teacher and motivator.

Many of us grew up hearing about the evils of money and a little scripture twisting to remark that \\"Money is the root of all evil\\" (the correct phrase is \\"the LOVE of money is the root of all evil.\\")The strongest drive in a person's life is their need to be consistent with their identity. The truth is there is nothing evil about money and there is nothing wrong with wanting to be rich (the problem is in wanting to dominate another person). However, for some people they have taken the identity that they are undeserving or worse, God wants them to be poor.As Pilzer shares gloriously there is no limit to the wealth we can create, and as the water level raises it raises for everyone. The only thing that limits our ability is our vision.For instance, in the 1980's vinyl records were a 25 BILLION dollar business. Who could have seen that in four short years vinyl records would essentially be a thing of the past?Yet for those with vision (cassettes and later CDs and later MP3s), the end of records was not THE end, but was a beginning for something more as long as someone found the technology.Nobody had to divide scarce resources, instead wealth was created from something that previously didn't exist. What lies inside of you waited to be created, what is something invisible (your dream) that you can make visible? More than that how much more could you accomplish if you not only read but BELIEVED God was on your side and agreed that you DESERVE success? Careful, Pilzer might give you a whole new identity when it comes to relating to money!"},{"Title":"God Wants You to Be Rich","review":"I have listened to a great many people talk about the poverty of people and portraying themselves as the saviors of the have-nots. It always made me feel like I was from another planet because their rhetoric did not make sense at all. These people think that robbing one group of people Marxist style and give it to another would some how bring an end to poverty. Driven by envy they have convinced millions to think that their lack was caused by the ingenuity and industriousness of others who recognized the benefits of a free market economy which Karl Marx dubbed Capitalism.Now I am back on earth because Paul Zane Pilzer debunked the poverty myth and confirmed my thoughts on the subject. It gives an excellent account of what is causing the never ending cycle of poverty. It is not ingenuity nor is it capitalism. Poverty is caused by the lack of faith and the continued indoctrination that government is responsible for peoples well being. I love the title because faith is the force that moves you to make things happen. The following excerpt says it all.\\"In his last great book Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy the economist Joseph Schumpeter predicted that capitalism would eventually self-destruct because the people displaced by advancing technology would democratically vote in a socialist form of government.\\"\\"The word \\"economics\\" comes from the Greek word oikonomia meaning the \\"management of a household.\\" While today \\"economics\\" has come to mean the study of business and government issues by professional academics, the real economists in our society are the ones who practice economics--the hundreds of millions of people seeking to economically manage their own households or lives every day.\\"And when it comes to continually proving Schumpeter wrong in what he regarded as his great triumph, there is nothing more important than the role that now befalls you, the real economist, the reader of this book--the role to continually teach every member of our society how and why we live in a world of abundance, and how and why God wants every one of us to be rich. God bless you.\\"Instead of beating the same old poverty of the people drum the saviors of the have-nots need to read this book and give up the antiquated mindset that is doing the same thing over and over again but expecting different results.

This book is not about how God wants you to be rich and there's nothing in here about how you can enjoy material and spiritual wealth. It's Paul's explaination of how technology drives growth in a free market economy along with copious supporting evidence, prescriptions for changes in government policy, etc. While I agree with much of what he says, its nothing new and, frankly, he doesn't write very well.

His economic thinking is sound and inspiring, but his theological reasoning is terrible! His reduction of the Abrahamic Covenant in the Bible to material prosperity is stupid. If God promised economic prosperity to Abraham and everyone with faith, Jesus Christ himself must have overlooked it; Jesus wasn't rich in material goods. The blessing promised to Abraham and people of faith is primarily spiritual and can include but doesn't have to include material wealth. To claim the Bible teaches that &quot;God wants you rich&quot; is an insult to all the godly men and women through the ages who weren't rich -- and those today who aren't. This book will sell in prosperous U.S.A but that doesn't mean it's basic premise is correct.

Some of the negative reviews on this book have evidently been from those who read the title but not the book. It does NOT teach or perpetuate the belief that everyone is supposed to be wealthy if they're a Christian.What it DOES do is give the average person a GREAT explanation for why things are they way they are and why many economic changes are misunderstood simply because people don't look at a big enough picture. (For instance, a machine takes the place of three workers causing them to lose their jobs...bad news? No, because when those 3 workers find new jobs, the GNP goes up. A simplistic summary of one of Pilzer's examples, but you've really got to read it to appreciate it.)Also, he gives EXCELLENT suggestions for everything from our school system to transporation to healthcare to communications, etc.An absolute WONDERFUL book about how our physical resources are truly UNLIMITED and that the only &quot;lack&quot; we have is the lack of appropriation."},{"Title":"God Wants You to Be Rich","review":"Paul Zane Pilzer lays out a moral defense of why everyone should aim to become wealthy without feeling guilty.

Mr. Pilzer points out that consumers never become satisfied as was predicted in the 30's and 40's. Advancing technology always stays one step ahead of man and provides him with new and improved products which may be considered a luxury at first but will quickly become a necessity in our ever changing society. He also points out very effectively that technology is changing our society at an ever increasing rate. This is forcing us to abandon the practice of working for the same company for an entire lifetime. Changes in technology are constantly creating new industries which forces us to acquire new skills to remain employed."},{"Title":"God Wants You to Be Rich","review":"After reading Paul Zane Pilzer's first book, \\"Unlimited Wealth\\", I was anxious to read this one. And since I'm a Christian, and the author is Jewish, he comes from the Old Testiment's perspective that during the time of Abraham, God promised him wealth. This well written book helps to explain the theology of economics in today's society. As also stated in \\"Unlimted Wealth\\", we have an endless supply of resources. And where one technology fades away, another one takes its place. Two good examples are how CD's have replaced vinyl records and how fuel injectors have mostly replaced carberators in automobiles. We are given the premise all things come from God, and we have at our disposal new technolgies which have the potential to increase our wealth and quality of life. There is a very extensive bibliography with excellent support for the arguments in this book. Finally, we now know that being rich isn't evil or a sin. In the final analysis, it's how we use our wealth that counts. For it is indeed the \\"love\\" of money that is the root of evil. An excellent book. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"God Wants You to Be Rich","review":"The previous reviewer says that, boiled down to its essence, Pilzer claims that if you aren't rich, you will go to Hell. Not quite. He states that if you are rich, you won't be condemed to Hell. In this book, he explains how and why people for thousands of years thought that there were finite resources, and that in order to increase your wealth, you had to take from someone else. Under this theory, it is reasonable to argue that G-d wants you to be poor. However, he presents a rational theory which he first explained in his earlier book, Unlimited Wealth - his theory of Economic Alchemy. From that he shows how wealth is only limited by human ingenuity, which is essentially unlimited. It follows that with unlimited wealth being available, it is possible to become rich without taking the wealth from someone else. In fact, he demonstrates in his book, how by becoming wealthly, you provide a benefit to society, improving not just your own standard of living, but the standard of living of others as well; it is only by improving the lives of others that you can obtain lasting riches - both monetary and non-monetary.In short, he explains that while being poor is no great sin, neither is being rich."},{"Title":"God Wants You to Be Rich","review":"The economics that I learned in Business School was a confused science. It could not explain even the simpelest of phoenomena. The reason was that its very definition was &quot;the ways in which a society allocates scarce resources.&quot; What if there were no such thing as a scarce resource?Pilzer proves that there is not. His logic is simple and elegant. I am amazed that there is a review posted here that said he found the book confusing and the theories lacking real application. Maybe the reader was holding his copy of the book upside down. I would recommend turning it over and trying again.

To support this thesis, Pilzer cited, inter alia, the fact that since 1750 the gross world output has increased more than 1700 times whilst population has increased only 6 X.Given its aim to find the most equitable distribution of scarce resources, it is no wonder that economics was given the title of the \\"dismal science\\". But economists take little account of 2 factors that are in fact central to its understanding: people, who have limitless creativity to create new products and services that makes life better, and technology, enabling us to produce things with greater ease and at lower cost. Industrial competition forces ever increasing technological replacement to produce the best, cheapest products for the consumers, a process that economist Joseph Schumpeter called \\"creative destruction\\". Pilzer describes this process as \\"the grease that keeps the wheels of prosperity in motion\\"."},{"Title":"God Wants You to Be Rich","review":"Well, I must tell you that my group of eight CEO's read it and we all unanimously agree it is well worth reading!

This book covers the German fighter groups assigned to eastern front against Russia. By 1944 the front line German fighters were the FW-190 and the Me-109. Against the Americans and British the FW was the machine of choice. In the East it was still the Me as the Russian front line fighters were still inferior to the German machines.By late 1944 newer Russian aircraft became the equal to or exceeded the capabilities of the German fighters. By 1944 the enormous tank battle at Kursk had taken place, and the armored units were in bad shape. More and more of the burden fell on the German air force.Then in the middle of 1944 came the invasion and a new set of problems as the allies were quick to build fighter strips in France and brought over huge numbers of planes. This required the removal of some units from the Eastern Front.As with the other books in this series, this book is mostly photographs and drawings of the planes used by the various German units on the Eastern Front. A considerable amount of research went into determining the actual colors, markings, and other details of aircraft used by individual units.While Western historians and certainly movies would have you believe that the bulk of the fighting occured on the Western Front, the Eastern Front was the primary battleground so far as Germany was concerned. In 1944 the Russians admit to the loss of over 10,000 aircraft, the German loss was over 8,000.If aircraft color schemes are of interest to you, this book will be invaluable. If you are merely interested in the history of the Germans defending on the Eastern Frong, the photographs shown here present a story themselves that would be an excellent accompanyment to any written story."},{"Title":"Jagdwaffe Vol.5,Section 2 War in the East 1944-1945 (Luftwaffe Colours)","review":"This volume, by Bergstrom and Pegg, concludes the \\"Luftwaffe Colours\\" coverage of air combat on the Eastern Front. As with previous volumes in the series, it's a winner!The air combats fought in 1944 and '45 were some of the most desperate of the war as the shrinking band of Luftwaffe Experten waged a losing battle to counter Russian advances. Pilots such as Hartmann, Rall, Barkhorn, Brendel, Kittel and Hafner ran up tremendous scores against their VVS opponents but all for naught.Like earlier Russian Front volumes, this book is an engaging combination of text, a wealth of photos and gorgeous color profiles by Tom Tullis. (The work Tullis has done in interpreting black and white photos to create his artwork is worthy of Sherlock Holmes). Anyone interested in the Russian Front and Luftwaffe \\"top guns\\"(JG 51, JG 52, JG 54, etc.) will enjoy this book.All in all, a good overview and a visual treat. Highly recommended!***It's sad to see this series end. There's been a lot of first-class Luftwaffe history published in its 20+ volumes. Congrats to Classic Publications/Ian Allan for a job well done!"},{"Title":"Jagdwaffe Vol.5,Section 2 War in the East 1944-1945 (Luftwaffe Colours)","review":"Being the final book in the Jagdwaffe series that deals with the Luftwaffe's death struggle with the Soviet Red Air Force, \\"War in the East 1944-1945\\" provides an excellent conclusion to this subject. As usual, the photographs are interesting and thoughtfully chosen. I enjoyed the mini biography of Gerhard Barkhorn very much. There is also supposed to be a bio of the \\"Blond Knight\\" Erich Hartmann in the main text, but I haven't found it yet. However, the main draw for me once again were the color aircraft profiles by Thomas Tullis. Awesome job! This book is highly recommended to modelers or anyone else interested in this subject."},{"Title":"Jagdwaffe Vol.5,Section 2 War in the East 1944-1945 (Luftwaffe Colours)","review":"This book relates to the Luftwaffe actions on the east front in 1944-45, and more specifically the use of fighters.The book is well done in the sense that you see actual pictures and the corresponding profiles of some of the planes.If you are interested in everything that is related to German fighters in the East in 44-45, this book is a must have as it has some original pictures well worth seeing. However, you won't get a comprehensive view on the topic of German fighters in the East, but rather a sum of rehashed documents that already exist in other books.If you want a mid level comprehensive book on German fighters in 44-45 on the east front with lots of profiles, you will be left disappointed."},{"Title":"Tamburlaine the Great","review":"I love the &quot;Tamburlaine&quot; of Christopher Marlowe, because I've read it and couldn't resist it. The story is not melodramatically forced, but rather follows in a smooth and epic line, giving it the texture of a documentary. As a tragedy it's weird, encompassing all drifts of literature: darkly humorous, rhetorical, romantic, violent and deep, with an indescribable grandeur. People commenting on Marlowe's work usually regard him as psychologically shallow, but in this play the terrifying hero is so charismatically evoked in his language, sometimes rhetoric and sometimes commonplace, that I left the book with a queer sense of something between love and dread. Even Tamburlaine's worst deeds, like his cursory humiliation of the captive kings, gain an odd flavour of predestination: they're more of the hijinx of a power-drunk teenager than the actions of a cynical tyrant. Everyone should read this work, in which the dark-tinted wonders of the mediaeval Orient are called up in some of the most steelishly beautiful poetry I've ever read."},{"Title":"Tamburlaine the Great","review":"I'm not going to attempt to review the Tamburlaine plays, except to say that if you enjoy Shakespeare and haven't read Marlowe, get started. I love these plays.The quality of this edition of the plays, however, is worth describing. I purchased this edition for my students in an Honors High-School English class. It's a reasonable edition to teach with. The footnotes do a good job of identifying and explaining the concepts and terms my students weren't familiar with, and thankfully they are on the bottom of each page, rather than at the end of the book (which very few students will bother to turn to). The introductory material is OK, but not fabulous; if you want your students do to any serious background reading, you'll probably be making photocopies of other sources.The price was right, and the edition was fine for the classroom; I'd probably buy this edition again for students."},{"Title":"Tamburlaine the Great","review":"\\"You shall have honors as your merits be,\\" Tamburlaine promises the Persian turncoat, Theridimas (1.2.254). Christopher Marlowe's Tamburlaine makes no apologies for the rise of his shepherd to the heights of power, and frustrates the traditional tragedy by letting a ruthless character with an arsenal of tragic flaws fly through the play untouched. For readers, the boundless Tamburlaine becomes almost absurd, but a theme of the play resonates with the modern world, as Tamburlaine operates like an rogue entrepreneur who leaves the farm to become the owner of Persia, all while rejecting the forms of entitlement common to his age and redefining the rules of the game. He pulls himself up by his own bootstraps, like various modern leaders of the 20th century. However, his goal has no mapped out ideal behind it, other than the blind ambition and ruthless tactics he needs to uproot the status quo.The play begins with infighting among the Persian nobles, with Cosroe tormenting his brother, the king, Mycetes. At first sight, their banter seems comedic, but the subtext of the opening scene leads to further simplicities and exposes the single-minded holes in the mindset of the aristocracy, as the royal brothers beset themselves with power plays and infighting. They represent the entitled party, the assuming elite, and they label Tamburlaine as a \\"fox,\\" a \\"thief\\" who \\"robs your merchants,\\" he is \\"incivil,\\" and operates through \\"barbarous arms\\" (1.1.31-40).The initial portrayal of a fox contrasts with the following scene, where the characterization changes to a \\"lion\\" (1.2.52). Techelles, who at first seems a pandering subordinate, believes in Tamburlaine: \\"Methinks I see kings kneeling at his feet\\" (1.2.55). Likewise, Usumcasane praises his lord Tamburlaine, pledging his life to the cause, with the contract being his own promotion to king. These first compliments to Tamburlaine feel like gross ambition, like ruthless men willing to cut throats simply for power. And soon enough we realize that the goal of Tamburlaine has no admirable literary novelty propelling it; no, this is blind ambition, and Tamburlaine seeks men to work with him of the same mindset.To retreat to the first scene again, the tone of the play begins with Mycetes and Cosroe bickering over the throne, and by allowing the initial treatment of Tamburlaine to come from a royal court, the reader's perception of Tamburlaine sails off with a handicap of condescension. As a petty shepherd, he challenges the highest authorities, without cause. However, what precedes the play remains in the background. Mycetes, an inept leader, enjoys the fruits of one of his ancestor's ambition, and whoever founded the power that he enjoys, surely did not come to his position by goodwill.Brought up to believe fallacies regarding power, Cosroe complains, \\"What means this devilish shepherd to aspire / With such a giantly presumption, / To cast up hills against the face of heaven / And dare the force of angry Jupiter\\" (2.6.1-4). In other words, he thinks that Tamburlaine should step back and follow the old adage, \\"know thyself.\\"In reading the play, Tamburlaine's own words seem like ominous foreshadowing, as time and again he refers to death. In recruiting the traitor of Persia, Theridimas, Tamburlaine says, \\"And sooner shall the sun fall from its sphere / Than Tamburlaine be slain or overcome\\" (1.2.175-176). We wait for the sun to fall somehow, yet it doesn't. Next to Theridimas he says, \\"Thus shall thy heart be still combined with thine / Until our bodies turn to elements\\" (1.2.234-235). We wait for a cardiac event, but none arrives.Unlike a traditional tragedy, Tamburlaine rides out the end as if the play were a comedy: he gets married to beautiful and noble Zenocrate, who he met via a kidnapping. In a traditional tragedy, Tamburlaine would have to suffer an awful death for his actions, yet Marlowe ignores a full deck of tragic flaws, and lets his hero exit as a king who enjoys a mutual love with Zenocrate, his queen.The play has a lot of action, but gets very repetitive. The minor characters are not that interesting, except for Mycetes and Cosroe, who don't live for very long."},{"Title":"The Official Wilderness First Aid Guide","review":"I've been using Wayne Merry's Wilderness First Aid Guide to teach St. John Ambulance Wilderness First Aid courses since 1995. If you only read one wilderness first aid book, this is the one to read.Published in 1994, the Wilderness First Aid Guide was developed under a grant from the Donner Foundation to create first aid training that would be relevant to remote Northern First Nation and Inuit communities where help is often days away. It remains one of the best Wilderness First Aid publications available today.It's divided into 4 sections: first response, caring for casualties, wilderness injuries, and wilderness illnesses. There are sections at the end on: improvising first aid supplies, first aid kits, medications, signaling for help, and first aid checklists for documenting a rescue. Each problem is described in context, with many helpful examples and illustrations, and with sections on prevention, recognition of signs and symptoms (&quot;How to tell&quot;) and the appropriate first aid (&quot;What to do&quot;). Wayne differentiates between the first aid needed if help is an hour away and first aid if help is days away.In a wilderness setting, a rescue involves 8 steps. 1. Survey scene, 2. Find/ treat life-threatening problems, 3. Move casualty to shelter (or erect shelter over casualty), 4. Perform secondary survey and document findings/treatment, 5. Make evacuation decision, 6. Signal/send for help, 7. Provide &quot;second aid&quot; (warmth, fluids, food, &amp; waste management), and 8. Move casualty to help.Most other wilderness first aid books focus on the help needed in the first hour, but are sketchy beyond that. The Official Wilderness First Aid Guide explains the mechanisms/physiology underlying serious wilderness problems like hypothermia, dehydration, and shock in simple language, helping first aiders understand not just what to do but why. The chapter on moving a casualty to shelter details over 14 short distance lifting techniques for 1, 2 or multiple rescuers. The chapter on moving a casualty to help details techniques for stretcher building, carrying, and belaying, and reviews the pros, cons and special considerations of various land (ATV, snowmobile, komatik, dogsled), water (canoe, cabin cruiser) and air (airplane, helicopter) evacuations. There are also comprehensive chapters on second aid (taking care of someone while you wait for help), keeping warm, bear attacks, and abdominal complaints. These are crucial wilderness first aid skills that other manuals cover in a page or two, if they talk about them at all.Currently, this book is used as a text for the four day wilderness first aid courses offered by St. John Ambulance in British Columbia, Alberta, Ontario, Quebec, and New Brunswick. It has been translated into German, and in Germany you must have a Wilderness First Aid Certificate in order to purchase a Personal Locator Beacon rescue device.I recommend this book highly to anyone who spends time in the outdoors."},{"Title":"The Official Wilderness First Aid Guide","review":"I guess this book isn't a bad introduction for someone who is new to first-aid but much like St. John Ambulance courses in Canada, this book is limited in its scope and not much good for professionals or someone spending extented time in the backcountry or a remote setting. As a doctor, I would even go as far as saying that there is incorrect medical information but some of this could be the book and author seem to be out of touch with modern approaches to wilderness medicine and backcountry rescue. Again, this isn't terrible, there are just much better wilderness first aid publications out there: try Medicine for Mountaineering, or one of the Wilderness Medical Associates or NOLS publications."},{"Title":"A Reconstruction of the Assyro-Babylonian God-Lists An: Da-Nu-Um & An: Anu Sa Ameli","review":"very boring book. try malson's books they are better"},{"Title":"Then Came Heaven","review":"This story captured my heart from the very beginning.

I couldn't put it down, and read it in one day!"},{"Title":"Then Came Heaven","review":"I have read every one of LaVyrle Spencer books. This book as all of the books LaVyrle has written are never boreing. Some times I actually get so caught up in the story I find my self reading into the late hours of the night She is an excellent author and you will never go wrong by reading any of her books."},{"Title":"Then Came Heaven","review":"The most interesting part of this book was the learning about how the nuns lived in the 1950s. I very much liked Sister Regina, understood her pain and frustration and why she had feelings for Eddie and his girls. However, the romance between her and Eddie was missing something on his behalf- all of a sudden he had feelings for her too, they weren't developed enough and a lot more time should have passed since his wife's death before anything happened between them or between him and Irene. Overall, a well-written book that definitely helped expand my vocabulary."},{"Title":"Then Came Heaven","review":"This was such a treat to read. I am a mom a two girls, and I am Polish and come a Catholic family. I sure appreciated the in detail descriptions of the nuns and there way of life. And the feelings of this man and his girls. Lavyrle you cannot quit writing, this would be a horrible thing. You truely have a wonderful gift and I am well on my way to reading all your books and have absolutley loved everyone so far. I have never cried so hard in a book before. This book was so real and I really appreciate all Lavyrles talent here. Don't quit Because your books are such page turners before I know it I am done and I want to go on and on to more of the stories now you need to write sequels. The characters are like friends at the end of each story. This is a wonderful book."},{"Title":"Then Came Heaven","review":"Being a new Catholic I was really interested in reading about how it was for the nuns in those days. Since Vatican II a lot of things have changed. I'm thankful the Sister at our church is able to talk with us, hug us and be a real part of the community. Reading about the days when I was also growing up and remembering the little things like tying money for school lunch in the hankie, etc. brought back so many memories. This story holds your attention from the very first page and is almost impossible to put down. I wish it could have gone on and on. I thoroughly enjoyed every part. Ms. Spencer has a way of telling a story that puts you right in the middle of it all. I've read all her books and loved them all."},{"Title":"Then Came Heaven","review":"This has a good feeling of the time (1950) and place (Minnesota) it's set in. Emotionally it goes straight to your heart without asking too much of you. I enjoyed it, but it doesn't inspire me to read any of the author's other books."},{"Title":"Then Came Heaven","review":"The emotions in this book are captured in such perfection that I could not put this book down. The convent side of this story satisfied any doubt that I might have had in the past about leaving the Catholic church which I did years ago. It is such a shame that this talented author is retiring. I will miss buying one of LaVryle Spencer's new books in the future!"},{"Title":"Then Came Heaven","review":"My dad was born in Browerville, MN where this book took place and I grew up in Staples, MN. ANYONE from a small, Catholic town should read this book, even if you don't normally read romance books. This is one that you can feel yourself being a part of. I have never read one of Ms. Spencers books before, and purchased this one simply because of the picture of the Browerville church on the cover. Never has a book seemed so real to me. I don't think you need to be Catholic to enjoy the book; but I do think if you grew up Catholic, you will feel a special bond to the story."},{"Title":"Then Came Heaven","review":"Even though i am not a catholic, I enjoyed the book. but this book was not as good as her earlier ones. I am Lavyrle's fan, and I have all her books, some of them I've re-read many times .All her books make me laugh &amp; cry. My personal favorite is &quot;Separate Beds&quot;...the best. She's great, and I will miss the anticipation of readinga new title from her.."},{"Title":"Then Came Heaven","review":"I have read and LOVED all of Lavyrle Spencer's books and this was my last one, as well as her last one. I was so sorry to hear she has retired from writing, though I understand that she wants to spend time with her grandchildren and enjoy the &quot;golden&quot; years. I highly recommend this book...it was terrific!!"},{"Title":"Then Came Heaven","review":"I don't normally read novels but this was standing on a display when I walked by it at the library. The preface where the author explained she was using some facts about her own hometown caught my attention.As someone who attended Catholic school in the 1950s and well recall scary nuns like the embittered one in the book who hit unruly students, I found this novel overall to be unbelievable but still oddly touching. What woman wouldn't want to be loved with such deep devotion and respect as Eddie showed?I cannot believe that any area - especially the close-knit small town described in the book - could so easily embrace a former nun returning to their town (after a 2 month absence) in the entirely different role of wife and step-mother. It just doesn't ring true to me. I think even today's society would have some difficulty adjusting to that sea change without taking a few deep breaths.That said, I still found the novel fascinating to read; maybe I'll even look up some other books by the same author!"},{"Title":"Then Came Heaven","review":"Just in case you haven't read this book, I put some spoilers in this review.Although you generally know that Spencer's books will turn out happily, this one made it way too obvious way too early.And it really didn't seem like anyone in the town or in the Catholic Church was all that upset that Sister Regina ditched her vows (albeit with a lot of thought and prayer). Just seemed like no one thought about it at all. OK, nun one day, wife a little bit later, whatever. I was raised Catholic, and I can tell you that in my home parish, that type of thing happening would have been gossip fodder for weeks.And frankly, the wedding night at the end was kind of creepy to me. Can't quite pin down why, but it just came off as weird.A nice light read, but I've liked some of Spencer's other books a lot better."},{"Title":"Then Came Heaven","review":"The detailed description of convent living in the 1950s was informative and educational. Curiosity alone should encourage people to buy this book. But for the true romantic, it might be a disappointment. I felt as if Spencer was holding back in developing this romance in order remain respectful. With this purpose in mind, perhaps the subject was too close to heart."},{"Title":"Then Came Heaven","review":"I have read many L. Spencer books in the past few years, and I always find that her characters stay with me long after the book is back on the shelf. When Nora Roberts and Catherine Coulter characters are long forgotten, Lavyrle Spencer's heroes are so memorable that I can recall their names, interests and loves years later. &quot;Then Came Heaven&quot; is the best of the best! I cried throughout the whole thing, and read it in an entire day. Highly, highly recommended! Lavyrle, if you've got it in you to do another, I'll buy it... twice!"},{"Title":"Then Came Heaven","review":"Am disappointed -- that this is her last book -- and that it wasn't better. I enjoyed the characters and the setting, but it was so predictable.My main problem was with the deceased wife, Krystyna. She was THE ONE who gave such-and-such to the sisters. And she was THE MOST such-and-such. Whatever it was...she was the Nth. (Puh-leeze!) If she was so wonderful, what was she doing on the railroad tracks with her car? (And all those glass canning jars -- why weren't they in the trunk?)I'll say it again...come back, LaVyrle!!"},{"Title":"Then Came Heaven","review":"I was immediately taken in by the story of Eddie Olczak. The setting of the story invited the reader to settle there and come to know the characters...which I did. I found the author's descriptions of the small town, the people, the church, the priest and the religious community of sisters to be real and not manipulated or contrived. The struggle that Sr. Regina experienced was also quite valid and very well illustrated, as was the reaction of her family to her leaving the community. Although I found a few errors, the description of religious life, along with the trauma of leaving that life (especially before Vatican II, 1963-65) were pretty accurate. As a former religious sister, myself, I felt a strong connection with the story, as well as with the small town which was very much like the one from which my own family came. Also, Spencer's description of the sisters with whom Regina lived reminded me of some of those with whom I used to live!! (There were no exaggerations here!!) Regina and Eddie's evolving love story seemed very natural, sweet and innocent. (And, of course it was predictable...a young widower and a young nun struggling with her vocation? What else would one expect?!) Spencer handled the relationship delicately and with great respect. (I should be so lucky to find someone as lovely as Eddie!!) Good work, LaVyrle, I think this was a charming contribution with which to end your writing career! From the sound of it, you either interviewed some wonderfully candid religious (and former religious) women or may have even been one yourself...??? Wouldn't a sequel entice you?"},{"Title":"Then Came Heaven","review":"I loved it! Eddie OlcZack is a janitor at the local church in a nice community. On the first page, his wife dies leaving him to father their two daughters,Anne and Lucy. Jean(Sister Regina) a nun at that same local church has always qustioned her vocation. No more, you gotta read!!"},{"Title":"Then Came Heaven","review":"I enjoyed this book as I did Spencer's previous books, but I feel that this one was lacking something. I don't think the story moved fast enough in the first few chapters. I was wondering when she was going to get around to the point. Once she did, I was not at all disappointed, but for the first time I truly had a hard time getting into the book. As for whether this is truly her last book or not, I guess we'll just have to wait and see. Can you retire from writing like you retire from accounting or law?"},{"Title":"Then Came Heaven","review":"I can't help feeling dissapointed with this book. I've read many of Spencer's books including Years, The Fulfillment, The Endearment and Morning Glory and enjoyed all of them. But this book, Then Came Heaven is a total letdown. The beginning and middle part of the book was interesting enough, when it kept you guessing when will Eddie confess his love to Sister Regina and vice-versa. But, to be honest, there's hardly any chemistry between those two. And I think it's not just because Regina is a nun... I find that the 'love' between them developed a little too quickly and out-of-a-sudden. Eddie's wife had only been dead for about 3 months.. and Eddie had already kissed and seduced his sister-in-law and has the 'hots' for Sister Regina. Eddie didn't turn out to be a very likeable hero after all. Nothing is mentioned on what Eddie and Sister Regina find so fascinating about each other. The love and emotional scenes seemed false and forced. I felt that Spencer could've done better. After Eddie (finally) confessed his love for Regina, the story just went downhill all the way.... you might as well close the book there and then to save you the awful dissapointment when you come to the end of the book. Unless you're a true Spencer fan, I suggest you stay away from this book, but read some of her earlier works like Morning Glory (which was made into a movie starring Christopher Reeves), Years (my favourite) and The Fulfillment."},{"Title":"Then Came Heaven","review":"I could not get past everything that I didn't know about the Catholic religion to enjoy the romance in this book. Ms. Spencer has given us so many great romances that I would recommend before this one. &quot;Family Blessings&quot; and Hummingbird&quot; being two of the best!"},{"Title":"Then Came Heaven","review":"What a wonderful heart lifting story! Spencer captures the conflict growing in the religious community prior to Vatican II, and portrays characters that have real yearnings coupled with fear and doubt, who strive to do the right thing, even when they are not sure what the right thing is. The portrayal of the Catholic school was so exact, I could smell the white paste and eraser dust in the classroom and remember the fear of the punishment from the nuns who felt that to spare the rod was to spoil the child. I finished this book wistfully wishing that nowadays family and neighbors would come together in a disaster to help a family undergoing a tragic loss. Shortly thereafter, the train-truck collision in Bourbonais Illinois made the headlines. Buried in the pages of the paper, I found stories telling of how the people of Bourbonais opened their hearts and pocketbooks to assist following the accident. The wonderful atmosphere described in the book does live on in small towns, and Spencer is truly blessed to have a home such a Browerville. This book served to reaffirm the belief that good people exist today, not only in fiction, but in reality if only we take the time to look."},{"Title":"Then Came Heaven","review":"I have been reading Ms. Spencer's books for years, and was a little skeptical at first of the possibility of a love affair between a nun and a widowed man, but in the end I loved the story. It is a great story of the triumph of the human spirit, and also of how someitmes you just don't know what will happen with love. Being born and raised as a Catholic, I found it interesting that the &quot;convent parts&quot; bridged into a world not often seen by everyday people like you and me! I highly recommend this read! She is one author that I will miss looking for in the future."},{"Title":"Then Came Heaven","review":"As an avid LaVyrle Spencer reader, I was excited to find this treasure at the store. This book does not disappoint her fans! Although the plot was somewhat predictable, it still kept you turning those pages!

The story of a Nun and widower and the difficulties they encounter on their road to love was one of her best."},{"Title":"Then Came Heaven","review":"I enjoyed this book SOOOOOO much. I live about 30 miles from where she sets this book. Lavyrle made it all seem so real. I hope they make a movie out of this one, but I hope this one is actually filmed in Browerville.

In a novel that focuses on spirituality and faith (and therefore on inner qualities), the detailed descriptions of the childrens' physical beauty and perfect clothing seemed out of place. Perhaps the children were drawn so perfectly in order to stress the innocence of childhood compared with the brutality of death.Aside from that, I found the characters and their motivations believable and realistic; the storyline not as predictable as I thought it would be; and the story as a whole to be entertaining and well-written. This is one of my favorite &quot;clean&quot; romances ... it is wholesome, squeaky-clean and old-fashioned.I'm so sad to hear LaVyrle retired. I love her books."},{"Title":"Then Came Heaven","review":"Best love story I have read. Can't keep my eyes dry during the whole time reading it.

I did find it a bit slow at times but the plot was still very interesting and it did keep me up til two this morning finishing it.I did enjoy getting a peek into the lives of nuns, I never knew how restricted it was before reading this book. For instance, the rules of limited personal conversation and no physical contact even with children. Reading the book, I felt the anguish and frustration of Regina.A few things were disturbing. For instance, I was quite impressed when Regina applied to complete her masters degree in child psychology after she left the convent, but was disappointed that she just dropped the idea totally when marriage was proposed. There was no mention of doing it in the future or anything. Also, I didnt't like when she got married and wanted to do some of the same things Eddie's deceased wife used to do, such as making chokecherry jam, etc.I did think the courtship was rushed. I would have preferred if they dated a while rather than him proposing on the third date. It grabbed me as needy and desperate. He often focussed on how he needed a mother for his children, in my mind it looked like he wanted a housekeeper. But then again thats small town culture i suppose. I would have freaked out at a proposal at such an early stage in the game. I was also quite surprised that the hometown accepted the idea of the ex-nun and janitor so easily. i would have expected them to be more gossipy and scandalous.All in all I did enjoy it."},{"Title":"Then Came Heaven","review":"Glad to have found a book of this author that I had never read before.

We enjoyed the book and expect her to also."},{"Title":"Then Came Heaven","review":"One of the best books she has written right up there with Morning Glory. Ms Spencer writes with such description its like you are living the story as she tells it. The characters are very well developed and the plot moves very smoothly. Marvelous story."},{"Title":"Then Came Heaven","review":"LaVryle Spencer is one of my favorite authors, but this book is probably the worst of her work. The story is contrived, neatly packed with weak writing and very little storyline. In 1950, a nun who leaves the order to date a man wouldve caused more of a scandal. Everyone is the book seems ok with this prospect, including the religious figures in the story. The nun's mother and grandmother are the most \\"scandalized.\\" However, their opinions become muddled quickly and everyone wants to give the couple \\"a chance.\\" Nice, neat package. My favorite continues to be Morning Glory. Sorry LaVyle."},{"Title":"Then Came Heaven","review":"This a one of the best books I've read. A tragedy and love story. It was very interesting to learn how nouns lived years ago. Would definitely recommend this book."},{"Title":"Then Came Heaven","review":"Before I read this story I read the foreword from the author about the setting of the story - a town just like the one she grew up in. This was her last book as she retired from writing after it and it shows an author at the top of her game - I wish she had continued.This book is full of evocative details of a life entirely unlike that of mine, growing up in the 1970s and 1980s in England. The life described in the American town of Browerville, where the Catholic Church is the centre of village life, seems very alien to me. It was also an interesting read knowing the recent history of the Catholic church and its problems with abusing priests. Yet in this story the church is, by and large, a force for good and the glue that holds the town together.The book starts with a shattering event - the death of mother-of-two Krystyna. Her widower, Eddie Olczak, has to continue his job as a handyman for St Joseph's Catholic Church whilst caring for his bereaved daughters. The initial chapters are difficult reading as the author skilfully portrays the devastation of this untimely death.The story focuses then on one of the nuns, a teacher at the school to which Eddie's daughters go. Sister Regina has been in the convent for all her adult life but is beginning to find she doesn't quite feel she fits any longer. With all the emotion over Krystyna's death, and the difficulty of being reconciled to this event, Regina struggles further. As a nun she has to obey Holy Rule and yet, for her, it doesn't always seem right.Regina and Eddie discover a connection between them that is more than a shared love for Eddie's children. But what can a nun do about an attraction to a man? It is this part of the book which is so wonderfully written, as we follow Regina's thoughts and decisions about her future and whether it involves life with Eddie; indeed, whether this is possible.This is a real feel-good book with characters about whom we care and who we know are good and kind. I found the whole children's schooling in catechisms and other stuff rather mind-boggling from an English Protestant point of view, but it opened a window into a different world, that when everyone knows everyone else and the community that creates, and I know this is a book which I will read many more times."},{"Title":"Then Came Heaven","review":"I feel it was a bit shocking that this widower would so quickly fall in love with another woman. I mean, just a few weeks after burying his beloved wife he's ogling the nun. And the nun is falling for him before his wife is cold in her grave? Well written, yes, but the storyline is a bit unbelievable. She should have placed the romance a couple of YEARS after the death of Krystyna, not just a few days."},{"Title":"Then Came Heaven","review":"I read Then Came Heaven many years ago, and for some reason the name of the book just came to me out of the blue. I hunted for it and found it through Amazon. Easy! The book was as good as I remembered it, though I had forgotten a lot of the story, so I thoroughly enjoyed it all over again! If you are looking for a good story with heart that portrays everyday life in detail, you will probably love it too."},{"Title":"Then Came Heaven","review":"This book had too many unrealistic plots. Yes nuns left the convent in the 50's but I don't think it would have been as easy as it was portrait in the book. I don't think the small town would have let her get away with marrying someone in their town and think it was ok. Small towns today would have a problem with this also. If it had been any other situation this probably would have flowed. I still enjoyed the book.I have read all of Lavyrle's books. I am sorry that this is the last one. I will miss her. I have all the tapes to the book so I will continue to hear her. My husband enjoys her also."},{"Title":"Then Came Heaven","review":"This is the 2nd Lavyrle Spencer book I have read and I enjoyed it much more then &quot;That Camden Summer&quot;. A perfect light summer read that gets better and better as you go."},{"Title":"Then Came Heaven","review":"In LaVyrle Spencer's last book before retirement, she brings you back to 1950 Bowersville, MO. Eddie Olczak's beloved wife Krystyna has just been killed and he and his two daughters are mourning her death. Eddie turns to Sister Regina, a nun battling her own problems.Although Sister Regina would love to comfort Eddie and his two daughters, Holy Rule forbits any contact. She battles with her feelings and her feelings toward Eddie. This is a book less about romance and more about soul searching.Always a fan of Ms. Spencer, I found this book to be a good end to a great career. We'll miss our beloved LaVyrle!"},{"Title":"Then Came Heaven","review":"I have read every book Lavryle Spencer has written I was shocked when she announced this was her last. It has been some time ago since I read it but I would love to read some more. Most of her books I have read several times. This book had tragedy, love, family dynamics and we could all recognize ourselves somewhere."},{"Title":"Then Came Heaven","review":"Why does it have to end? Not just this story but the writing career of LaVyrle Spencer. She is wonderful. I have enjoyed so many of her books and hate to see them end but I know she deserves to retire and be with her family more. If this story does not get to your heart I don't know what story could."},{"Title":"Then Came Heaven","review":"I am not a romace reader. I stumbled on this work at the University of Colorado Library by chance. I admit I was stunned to see a catholic town in prodomiately Lutheran Minnisoda. After I got into it I found it delightfuly surprising and remminicent of Audrey Hepburn in &quot;A Nun's Story&quot;. If this book had been a movie, I couldn't imagine anyone else doing the charming role of Sister Regina. I must give high marks to this story, especially being a romance, that was clean with no explicit scenes or strange places. Just ordinary folks in an extraordinary cirumstance that turns out for the best. I look forward to re-reading this book considering it has been consistantly CHECKED OUT ! Thank you Lavryle for putting a smile on a new reader's face and best of luck to you as well as Eddie and Regina Olzack."},{"Title":"Then Came Heaven","review":"This was a wonderful story. I lauched and cried and smiled so much reading this book, my husband is convinced that it must be good and he wants to read it. My heart went out to those two little girls and they just broke my heart over and over, I guess because I have to little girls myself. Thank you once and again for a wonderful weekend reader."},{"Title":"Then Came Heaven","review":"Then Came Heaven is an interesting (and plausible) look at a small-town Catholic community before so many changes occurred in Catholicism. Eddie's trauma over losing his wife with two young daughters to care for is excruciating...Sister Regina's compassion and tenderness for the girls is the lifeline she uses to keep herself sane - and eventually is what helps her make up her mind to leave the convent. Her love story with Eddie was tender and believable...and I find myself wondering how they fared (fine, I feel sure). Spencer's writing gift brings the reader along on journeys, some so intimate that you feel a little uncomfortable (but can't put the book down). I enjoyed a look at convent life and the Church in those days, which provided a wonderful backdrop to the love story!"},{"Title":"Then Came Heaven","review":"This is the first book I have read by LaVryle Spencer, and I am hooked. I can't wait to read more of her books! She really lets you feel the emotions of the characters and you are completely sucked in. I cheer for Sister Regina and Eddie. If it is time for you to make a big, important change in your life, you will be inspired by the characters in this book. I finished the book with a smile on my face and tears of joy in my eyes."},{"Title":"Then Came Heaven","review":"I had never read a bood by LaVyrle Spencer until Then Came Heaven. It was absolutely wonderful. I read a lot of books but I really think this one is exceptional. My mind was alive as I read about the realistic problems faced by a single parent. Ms. Spencer made his job sound like what it was - honest, hard work done well by a diligent person - not just a janitor. She also showed insight into a spirtual journey by Sister Regina. Her characters are wonderful. I was very impressed."},{"Title":"Then Came Heaven","review":"&quot;Then Came Heaven&quot; is a totally unique romance novel. Set in a midwest Polish Catholic community in the 1950s, it is a beautifully crafted glimpse of a time when the world was simpler and more innocent. The primary characters are a grieving widower and a nun who is struggling with her vocation. Spencer always does a wonderful job of drawing the reader into the emotional lives of her characters, and these two are particularly sympathetic. The majority of the book focuses on their individual struggles before turning to the romance that springs from their mutual respect and support. The love story is very sweet and handled with great sensitivity. I also enjoyed the glimpse into the inner life of the nuns."},{"Title":"Then Came Heaven","review":"This is one of the most beautiful books I've ever had the privilege to read. When at first I heard the news LaVyrle Spencer was retiring, I wasn't really disappointed because several of her later books had fallen flat for me. Now, I'm suddenly struck by the sadness of never, ever being able to read a new book of hers again. The setting is 1950 in a small Polish community in Browerville, MN - Spencer's hometown. Perhaps it's her familiarity with the setting that makes this book come alive. The book opens as the community is stunned by the death of a young wife and mother, Krystyna. No one is more grief-stricken than her husband, Eddie, who is the janitor and bellringer for the local Catholic church and school. Their two daughters, Anne and Lucy are 4th and 3rd graders taught by Sister Regina. Sister Regina has been questioning her vows and now that she is prevented from physically comforting the girls, she questions them even more. As the book progresses, Sr. Regina and Eddie begin to have feelings for each other but are frustrated by not being able to act on these feelings. I'm hesitant to reveal more for fear of spoiling this very wonderful, touching book. Please do yourself a favor this Holiday season and treat yourself to this book!"},{"Title":"Then Came Heaven","review":"Then Came Heaven is my first Lavryle Spencer novel. And, unfortunately, I can only report mixed reactions. I have nothing but praise for the author's tender and heartwarming portrayal of 1950's small town Mid-western life, and clearly well researched and very compelling portrayal of life amongst an order St. Benedectine nuns. Spencer does a wonderful job of developing a cast of strong, credible and diverse characters.My only complaint is that the plot's romantic development was simply not executed as skillfully as the other aspects of the story. I had a hard time believing that just weeks after the heart-wrenching loss of his wife (my copy of the novel now suffers a little &quot;water&quot; damage in the early chapters)Eddie was already succumbing to his sister-in-law's seduction attempts. And it made me uneasy that Regina seemed so intent on emulating so many little aspects of Eddie's late wife. Too often the budding love affair between Eddie and Regina seemed like more of a continuation of his life with his wife than the beginning of a &quot;new&quot; life with a &quot;new&quot; woman.Overall, this is a good read. And I'll hope my next Lavryle Spencer might be just a little better developed."},{"Title":"Then Came Heaven","review":"My favorite Lavyrle Spencer book is YEARS. I have yet to find one as good that one. However, this book was pretty good. Being raised Catholic I could relate to all the religious practices. I couldn't help but feel terrible for Eddie and his daughters. He was such a strong man for himself and his children. I liked Sister Regina. She depicted the fact that although one does make a commitment to God they are still human beings with needs. The only thing I had a hard time understanding was how quickly the love between these two developed. Not that it's written anywhere how long is it proper to wait until you fall in love again. But, the attraction between these two was pretty quick. I have to admit that I had a problem with Irene. Her sister wasn't even buried and she already had her eyes set on Eddie. What ever happened to respect, especially for your sister. Shame on Her! Other than that it was a good book."},{"Title":"Then Came Heaven","review":"What does God plan for your life? Just when you think that everything is God-blessed and the way it should be, suddenly a tragedy occurs that might make you shake your faith in Him. The year is 1950 and Eddie Olzcak had a wonderful life with his beloved wife and two young daughters. Eddie is a devout Catholic who works as a janitor in the local Catholic school, who rings the bells in the church for all the Masses, and helps out the nuns in the convent. One afternoon, his wife's car is hit by a train and she is killed instantly, shattering the perfect life he had with her. He is sad, angry, confused, he misses his wife terribly, he is lonely, but he knows he must go on with his life, and he does....Sister Regina, one of the nuns in the convent, who teaches 3rd and 4th grade at the school Eddie works at, and has his two daughters in her class, has been unhappy for some time with her life, wondering if this is the life God really wanted for her. She is part of the Benedictan order of nuns that has strict codes and follows a Holy Rule that forbids, among other things, any type of secular interaction that involve emotions or feelings; her life is supposed to be directed at constant prayer. So when Eddie's wife dies, Sister Regina feels at a loss; she wants to hug the children, but she can't; she wants to counsel Eddie, but she can't, and during this time, she realizes that being a nun isn't her calling. If she's not a nun, does that make her any less holy than Eddie's wife, Krystyna, who was a wonderful woman, who helped out in the community, who loved her husband and children dearly? Something also happens to Sister Regina during these next few months: she's getting feelings for Eddie, and he senses it, and Eddie discovers that he's starting to feel the same way about her. Both have guilt...Eddie wonders if it's too soon to love again after his wife dies, and Sister Regina wonders if it's a sin to fall in love with a man just because she's a nun. This is just a wonderful story about how love can be found again after a tragic circumstance and Lavyrle Spencer handles it beautifully. Isn't love between a man and a woman a gift from God? Eddie and Sister Regina find out that it is. I really enjoyed this story and it was a great final book for LaVyrle Spencer to write before she retired. I will miss her writing."},{"Title":"Then Came Heaven","review":"I think all of the reviews here miss the point.Maybe I have a different perspective because I was lucky enough to stumble across the book on tape first. I bought the abridged version first, but the story was so very engrossing, I eventually checked out the un-abridged edition. The telling of this story must be very different than the reading because I found it very compelling and couldn't wait for the next chapter.In this modern day, we rush. We move at a break neck pace in everything we do, even our relationships. We rush in where angels fear to tread and then back out at leisure and on to the next.Welcome to Browerville. A slower pace; a town you might pass on the highway and wonder for a moment about the lives lived there. Not a more \\"innocent\\" time, a cliche one reviewer falls back on, as most do when referring to the mid 1900's. This story is earthy and practical. The characters heart-breakingly human and real, deserving of the time and care given to them.What doesn't happen here, and what I think is unimaginable for some of the reviewers is that these two people actually do what is best for them but they wait until the right time to do so. They don't ride roughshod over other people to get what they want. They don't think only of themselves. Their journey is one of shared agony and love, both unspoken. How they come to finally verbalize what they know the other is feeling and how it develops into romance is a subtle refrain in this story I feel many have missed.I found their inner and and outer struggles daunting. How they deal with their growing feelings for each other, their families, their community and their beliefs is nothing short of an everyday miracle reminding us of the strength and the power of true love.A story not to be missed and definitely worthy as Spencer's last effort."},{"Title":"Then Came Heaven","review":"As a woman who grew up in the 50's I was taken back to the ideas, mores and habits of that time through the words in this book. While I did not grow up Catholic, a close friend of mine did and this book echoes many of the memories she has shared with me about her Catholic girlhood and that of a relative who became a Catholic nun. I think this book will be a step back in time for many &quot;over 50 year olds&quot; who grew up Catholic."},{"Title":"Then Came Heaven","review":"I thought it was very spiritual, but inspirational. I felt all of the emotions throughout the book. I'd recommend this book to my family and friends, and readers everywhere."},{"Title":"Then Came Heaven","review":"I have read 7 of LaVryle Spencer's novels and this is problably the worst one yet. Usually I can't put her books down, this one took me over a week to read (usually I read one in 2 days). It was a nice story but I loved her other books so much this one just didn't stack up. I recommend YEARS, MORNING GLORY, and SEPERATE BEDS."},{"Title":"Then Came Heaven","review":"I love LaVyrle Spencer but I had a problem with Then Came Heaven. I gave it 3 stars because of the first 90 pages that dealt with Krystyna's death and funeral, and the description of the school, the nuns' house and the description of the individual nuns. I tried to like the idea of a relationship between Eddie and Jean but I just couldn't do it. And believe me, I really wanted to. I did like the descriptions of Thanksgiving at The Olzack's and Christmas at the Potlocki's, and I enjoyed reading about Browerville. (We drove through Browerville in 1980 and I vividly remember driving by the church!)After I read the book I thought if someone else had written it she might have eventually written a \\"prequel\\" about Eddie and Krystyna's childhoods and marriage (after all, they were married for 10 years) and also Jean's childhood and what exactly made her decide to become a nun when she was \\"just eleven.\\" There were a lot of interesting characters in the book, i.e., Irene, Rosella Potlocki, Romaine and Rose, etc., that would have been worth developing."},{"Title":"Then Came Heaven","review":"I just loved this book. It was probably one of the best that I have read from LaVyrle Spencer. I've enjoyed reading all of her books, and I must say that I was quite shocked to read that this would be her last. I'm always so happy when I see her new books in the bookstores. In this book, I loved all the characters, Jean, Eddie and even Krystyna, even though we never met her. Just like with all of LaVyrle's books, I never wanted this one to end."},{"Title":"Then Came Heaven","review":"to start a book out with such an awful scene, I was skeptical. I cried thru the first 45 pages and have only been reading a couple of hours! It's surburb how she brings the characters to life, like I know them and have met them. It is also nice to see the other side of the cathoilic religion! I was rasied to appreciate all religions but never fully comprehended what they believe or why. This clears all that up, the sacrifice of a nuns life is pheomainal!! LaVryle I will miss you dearly! your the fist writer in 20 years I found that I enjoy as much as you. I feel I've know you through each one of your characcters! Thank you for the last 3 yrs of reading pleasure! I am going to collect every book I can get my hands on, hard cover or paperback, now that you are retiring!! Have fun and enjoy life to it's fullest. Your newest fan for life . CJ Patterson"},{"Title":"Then Came Heaven","review":"This was truly a heartwarming and beautiful story. I've noticed in other Lavyrle Spencer books I've read that she does an incredible job of painting the picture of a grieving person. This book was no exception. I felt so much pain for Eddie and his daughters. And I could always feel the other characters' pain as well, especially Regina's.Another thing I enjoyed about this book was the setting. The town she wrote about could have been the hometown I grew up in, except everyone was Dutch and Christian instead of Polish and Catholic. But the way of life was the same.The only reason I gave this book only four stars instead of five is because there was a lot of focus on Catholisism, and since I'm not Catholic, I didn't find some of it interesting. Maybe because I don't understand a lot of it. I was amazed, however, at how much the nuns were isolated from everyone. I always had the misconception that they were out in the world helping people, but these nuns weren't allowed much at all. That aspect was very interesting. I also agree with some of the other reviewers that this wasn't Spencer's best, and it is a little disappointing that she retired on this note. Even though I liked this story, it just didn't have that &quot;can't put it down&quot; experience like I usually get from Spencer's books. But I do recommend this book if you like a sweet love story with a happy ending."},{"Title":"Then Came Heaven","review":"I read the book,&quot;Then Came Heaven,&quot; by Lavyrle Spencer. I liked this book because I could relate to the story line. Every one has lost a loved one, and this book showed the emotions of that loss. Eddie and Krystyan fell in love in high school, and later got married. They had two children, and were married for about two years. One summer day, Krystyan was in a hurry and sped through a stop light. She crossed train tracks, and was hit from the side.She died instantly. The story then goes on to show Eddies depression. He slowly learned how to live without her, and how to raise their children. Years went by, and he met a woman named Jean. He became close to her,and they fell in love. She taught him how to move on. This book is good for young adults, and older adults. I wouldn't recommend this book for young readers. I enjoyed the happy,sad, and terrible moments of the book. It was well written, and was told from an outsiders point of view. I think women would like this book better than men would. If you want to read a good story about love and tragedy, I recommend this book for you. It is a book for mature readers and ones who would appreciate the full story. Through its sad,and sometimes slow parts, I truly enjoyed &quot;Then Came Heaven.&quot;"},{"Title":"Then Came Heaven","review":"While I've enjoyed every Lavryle Spencer book that I've read, I did not enjoy Then Came Heaven nearly as much!The book is about Eddie who has lost his wife and is trying to get on with his life and raise his two girls who are 8 & 9 years old. Eddie is the local Catholic school's janitor and he becomes quick friends with the girls teacher, Sister Jean. While Sister Jean adores Eddies girls, Anne and Lucy, she is not allowed even to touch them to comfort them in their mothers death. Slowly, we start to see Sister Jean become unhappy with her life as a nun and question her decision to ever become one.While the description for this book had me very excited to read it, it just didn't live up to my expectations or Spencer's other books I've read (such as Seperate Beds, Small Town Girl and Twice Loved). I think it was an interesting premise, but it just fell short. I had a very hard time liking the characters. They just didn't seem \\"real\\" to me. And I had an even harder time getting into the relationship between Eddie and Sister Jean. I just didn't feel the chemistry. There were even parts in the book I was feeling a bit bored with the story.Overall, this was not Spencer's best book, nor was it worthy for her very last writing effort. I'd recommend another of her books before this one, That Camden Summer, Seperate Beds, Small Town Girl or Twice Loved- those were all excellent!"},{"Title":"Then Came Heaven","review":"My first LaVerle Spencer novel, and perhaps my last, Then Comes Heaven was shallow, trite and predictable. Only past praise of the author by a couple of respected friends kept me reading to the end, hoping all the while it would improve. Alas, it did not. It's &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; with only two children, LOTS of Catholic guilt, and no singing. If it was possible to give it no stars, I would."},{"Title":"Then Came Heaven","review":"Though the plot is predictable and the characters are superficial, the real problem with this novel is the author's thinly veiled prejudice against the Catholic Church. Though I'm not a Catholic, I am told there are many misrepresentations of the life in a convent. The heroine of the story ends up married, however, what is the point of passing from one patriarchical institution to another? I think that the author ended up with half of a novel; it would have been more interesting to follow the lives of the characters afterwards in a reality-based setting."},{"Title":"Then Came Heaven","review":"I didn't think anything could be as bad as HOME SONG, but I was wrong. This one is just as bad, is just as boring, and simply doesn't ring true.A complete waste of this author's time and talent."},{"Title":"Then Came Heaven","review":"This is the only LaVyrle Spencer book that I was ever unable to finish! I tried several times to become engaged in the story (a nun falling in love with a father, etc., seems like it would be engaging enough!!), but always found myself putting the book down and forgetting about it. I think a Spencer fan should attempt this book, as others seem to like it, but should probably already enjoy the author before they try it. The only reason I did not give it 1 Star is because I respect the author and her attempt too much for that."},{"Title":"Then Came Heaven","review":"The church on the cover looks like a Russian Orthodox with the onion top architecture I love. One summer vacation, while driving through the countryside of Pennsylvania on the way to Valley Forge (then on to Longwood Gardens, near New Jersey), the place was full of fabulous churches. All I'd ever seen in my hometown and the small town were not exquisite like this one. Sometimes, I'd stop to get a closer view if the church had a special feature the others didn't have. I was not into photography then, or I would have had a field day.Eddie seeks help from the nun teacher of his young daughters after the death of his wife. Soon, a close relationship developed. Danny and Cecil received a Catholic school education, thanks to their mother. Perhaps she was aware of the dumbing down I knew nothing of until now.After two months of Hell at the hands of Chuck and his crew there, it was Heaven to be able to write again. Til now when Wink decided he had to enter the fray once again and cause some trouble for me. It won't last. God punishes those who intentionally hurt others."},{"Title":"Then Came Heaven","review":"The story of Eddie the widower and Sr Regina will touch your heart. The descriptions are very real and accurate. You really feel for the two girls left without their mother. This story however holds no surprises. Not as quickly read as all of her other books. A sweet last one to enjoy however-Lavryle say it isn't so!"},{"Title":"Then Came Heaven","review":"This book was full of interesting elements from beginning to end. The authors descriptive passage of the accident that takes the life of Krystyna was very moving and touching -- you really feel as if you are there, watching the whole scene unfold! Nearly all of the characters in the story seem very real and believable, and you really learn the depths of emotion that they are experiencing, without any slow spots or drudgery. Eddie's and Sister Regina's struggles with their range of emotions and their desire to do what is right and best for themselves as well as everyone else really carries the story along as their lives unfold. The supporting characters give a good balance as well. I was also impressed with the sense of community in the town where the story takes place. In today's hustle bustle world, it's hard to imagine that there really was a place where church was the social center of the community and people really did leave doors unlocked, and neighbors would come and go. In a way it's idealistic but seems to be a good and accurate reflection of the time setting (1950-51) of the story and of the town. In a way, the sense of community really rounds out the whole story. Thank you Lavyrle, for another entertaining and thoughtful story. I've only recently discovered this author, and this is the fifth book of hers that I've read. I sure hope she can come back with more books but until then, I plan to try to read all of her others!"},{"Title":"Then Came Heaven","review":"I have very few comments to add to what has already been said in previous reviews. This book had be glued to the pages. Ms. Spencer paints a picture with words. Its almost like being there and watching each scene unfold.I discussed this book with a friend of mine, an ex-nun, and she told me the life of a nun, as described by Ms. Spencer, is very true.This cannot be Ms. Spencer's last book! I doubt if her fans will allow it."},{"Title":"Then Came Heaven","review":"Set in the 1950's a young father becomes a widow, at the same time a young catholic nun is questioning the life she finds herself living... Lavrle Spencer has written a beautiful story, with likable characters. The way these two people realize that life can go on and an be just as wonderful after the loss of something you cherish can inspire anyone. Eddie has lost his wife and Sister Regina has lost her life as she has known it. When they finally come together you feel the innocence, the romance and the wonder of falling in love."},{"Title":"Then Came Heaven","review":"LaVyrle Spencer always writes a good book. However, some are much better than others. I can always tell her better books, because I feel an emotional connection to the characters. Then Came Heaven made me feel that connection. The characters and descriptions are vivid and the story entertaining. My heart went out to Eddie and his daughters when his wife was killed. I can't believe LaVyrle is retiring. We'll miss your books. My sister and I will both miss her stories, and we can only hope that in a year or two LaVyrle will find that she has another story to tell."},{"Title":"Then Came Heaven","review":"Be sure to have at least 1 box of kleenex next to you! This book must had me in tears in the first 4 chapters! I was extremely impressed by the way the author described the scenes with such depth and clarity that it hits your heart like a ton of bricks! This has got to be one, if not her best, books! I strongly recommend that people read this!"},{"Title":"Then Came Heaven","review":"Ms. Spencer has once again found the perfect words for feelings we have all shared. This author has such a unique way of describing emotions, places, and people that her readers will feel they can relate to. While this book is not as great as &quot;Years or the Gamble&quot;, it is a great story. However, it does sadden me that this is her last novel. I used to get so excited by the prospect of opening a new book by Ms. Spencer and now that joy is at an end. Thank goodness I have all her books to re-read later!"},{"Title":"Then Came Heaven","review":"I really enjoyed &quot;Then Came Heaven&quot;. As a Catholic who has an aunt that is a nun it hit close to home. I wasn't sure how she was going to pull this story off without offending people.

I couldn't put it down! The anguish that falls on Eddie after the death of his beloved Krystina is heartbreaking. You really feel for him and for his little girls, but mostly for Eddie's and Sister Regina's constant struggle to behave accordingly. Its a beautiful love story and I truly recommend it!I have to say that I found the story fascinating also because the reader gets a glimpse into the life of a 1950's Benedictine nun. I can't believe all the absurd and highly repressive rituals that Sister Regina and the other nuns have to endure. Not being able to show concern for another's grief nor demonstrate affection of any kind. Sad. I mean they only got permission to visit their real families once every five years! The constant struggle to obey unquestioningly without being able to do what she believes is right, not to mention the pains of keeping the unwavering \\"Holy Rule\\" are among some of the things Sister Regina begins to question with each passing day. She suffers through inner turmoil when reconsidering her chosen path and the world outside the repressing convent. You really feel her longing for family. So terribly sad.I'm Catholic and attended parochial school in the 80's -so I'm outraged at what nuns had to go through in the 1950's. I'm sure a lot of things changed between the 50's and 80's, and its not as repressive but I can't help but wonder about what life is like for nuns today.

But I work at small bookstore and decided to pick up an easy read on a day when there were very few customers in the store. I ended up getting hooked on this story and was annoyed when customers came in, because I had to stop reading. It is a charming, fun book that I thorougly enjoyed--to my own surpise."},{"Title":"Then Came Heaven","review":"This was a touching and moving story about a man thrust into the position of being a single father after the tragic death of his young wife. Eddie Olczak comes off as a simple man, a church janitor and bell ringer by trade, his wife, Krystna, a charitable and sweet woman whose tragic death leaves him and the entire community in complete and utter shock. The two little girls she leaves behind are heartbreaking, and their experiences in the little parochial school they attend are real and wrenching. At first, Krystna's spinster sister tries to take over in the hopes of eventually realizing her dream of loving and being Eddie's wife and mother, but this character is underdeveloped and fades into the background fairly quickly. Eddie is lonesome but hanging in there when he finds new love in the strangest place. The author really does a fine job of soul searching, and the story is a good one. The only drawback is it's lack of a punch line, lack of oomph, if you will. Still, it is a good read on a rainy day."},{"Title":"Then Came Heaven","review":"When I was a teenager, I read a lot of romance novels. Now that I'm an adult, I've put away the things of a child. I read this book only because it was in a box of discards my sister sent me.Why would a nun want to marry a janitor? I suppose that question smacks of snobbishness. So be it. The question is never raised in the book, and so it is never answered, but I'm still wondering.If my memory serves me correctly, this town had 400 people and two Catholic churches. That is really hard to believe. The Catholic church I attended as a child had at least 200 people at each of 6 Sunday services; thus, it served at least 1200 people. One Catholic church would have been more than adequate for all the people in the novel's town, even if everyone was Catholic."},{"Title":"El comentario bblico Moody: Nuevo Testamento","review":"This book is the clearest comentary on the N.T. in Spanish that I have found anywhere.

If you are not famillar with the genuis of a musical novel the idea is incredible. It brings upon an interesting form for exploring the duality of human experience. &quot;Moderato Cantabile&quot;, follows the form of the first movement of a sonata, presenting and developing in two contrasting themes in different keys. &quot;Moderato&quot; the word it self indicating a measure of control taken with the time signaure of a sonata being a square four-four outlines the meter the book follows. Anne's (the main character) life in the first theme starts out structured and boring. In the second chapter she begins her strange affair with Chauvin. Chauvin, or the the second theme is Ann's quest for the &quot;cantabile&quot; (the lyrical impulse, or exit from the first theme of boredom). They meet again and again, at the same bar and always at the same time of day, unitl the eighth chapter. Then, just as the eighth note of a musical scale is the same as the first (but an octave higher) the final resolution comes in the form of a symbolic reenactment of the murder that occurs at the end of the first chapter: Chauvin: &quot;I wish you were dead.&quot; Anne: &quot;I already am.&quot; --And Anne returns permanently to her boring life.Brillantly written and a must have in any book collection."},{"Title":"Moderato cantabile (An evergreen original)","review":"This novelette (~58 pages) is one of the most technically perfect pieces of fiction I have ever encountered. The \\"plot\\" is fairly conventional (but in many ways is inconsequential to the textual developments). The amount of detail hidden away in the narrative structure is incredible and the construction and crafting are about as perfect as could be desired. The story is interesting on so many levels that repetitive readings continue to illuminate and expand understanding.Consider how Duras plays with objectivity in the first central theme of the novel. After the first reading you'll conclude that a man murdered a woman in a cafe--presumably by shooting her through the heart upon her own request. And yet a closer reading reveals the problems with this assumption: a scream is heard, but no gunshot; blood comes from the victim's mouth, but not her heart; nobody (notably including the primary characters) actually witnessed anything; the man's behavior is unindicative of definitive guilt--perhaps he's simply distraught; the woman was the man's wife (we are told as one of the only \\"omniscient\\" acts of the unknown narrator)--but later an acquaintance notes that the woman \\"was married\\". In short, even the objective \\"murder\\" presented is anything but objective.Instead of reading a story you will end up inventing a plausible reality--just as Anne and Chauvin (the primary characters) invent a plausible reality to explain their unsatisfied (and unsatisfiable) desire.Ever wonder why Anne ignores the closest end-of-work-day siren but pays attention to the farthest-away end-of-work-day siren? Remember that her husband manages a factory. Remember that her husband's factory is the furthest away from the cafe, on the opposite side of town of her house. Remember that she has to beat her husband home from work. Details like this abound, but of course are left to a careful reader to pick them out and assemble them into a larger understanding.Such a beautiful novelette--so well crafted, so enjoyable to read and re-read. Thoroughly recommended.

As with many of Duras' books, one shouldn't expect to the affair to culminate in physical love or if it does, it probably won't be particulary pleasant or satisfying. For those looking for a realistic story where things don't necessarily go right, I recommend this book along with &quot;10:30 on a Summer Night,&quot; also written by Duras."},{"Title":"Moderato cantabile (An evergreen original)","review":"When I began reading this book (without the aid of a blurb) I expected a brilliant work concerning a puerile musical prodigy and his doting mother.

It is not until later in the book that one recognizes the brilliance of Duras--that same drop from the ideal is the one experienced daily by her heroine.

You come away feeling excited to get into the Bible and search down all the correlative scriptures mentioned. I enjoyed grasping the symbolism of Ruth, the gentile Moabite, redeemed by Boaz. Boaz serving as an archetype for Christ, our Redeemer. This is a love story we should all come to understand. Many thanks to Chuck Missler for the intelligent way he is able to communicate what he understands to be God's truth."},{"Title":"Romance of Redemption -OS (Basic Bible Studies)","review":"Recommendation:Great tape; great topical instruction. One of the best tapes a Christian can buy. Every Christian should learn about faith and commitment from the Moabitess (gentile) Ruth. One of my very few favorites. I have given 1-2 dozens of these tapes for my friends.If you are a new Christian you should get this. This book ranks up with John, Genesis and Revelation (Revelation is a great book not because of its prophecies, but because of its 340+ references from the Old Testament).Summary:One of the key Old Testament books that details the Levitical legal requirements for a &quot;kinsman redeemer. Ruth is a beautiful literary work with critical concepts and prophecies for the Jew and Christian alike. Also, teaches the laws for gleaning, the Leverite marriage, and other Jewish customs. Ruth is a powerful four (short) chapter book that also prophecies King David's birth in Bethlehem.It also demonstrates (indirectly) how suffering can have greatpurpose.Review:Naomi leaves Israel for Moab penniless and in her land (inheritance) in debt with her husband during a severe drought. Her two sons marry Moabitess and then die. When Naomi's husband dies she returns to Israel. Ruth perseveres and returns with Naomi, committing to love and worship Naomi's God. While gleaning, she happens on Boaz's land where he becomes interested in her - he had heard many good things about Ruth's faithfulness and commitment to Naomi. Naomi learns this and teaches Ruth the Jewish customs and laws and how to act for Boaz in order for Naomi to redeem her land, and therefore care for both of them. Boaz falls in love with Ruth and redeems Naomi's land, marries Ruth and is given a prophecy after the birth of his firstborn.Missler carefully instructs the listener in the subtle details that are missed when we casually read this book. Also, there are several passages that confound us, including Ruth's request for Boaz to &quot;put his skirt over her&quot;; the point that she is on the threshing floor with him when she makes this request; as well as the bizarre prophecies 1) &quot;may you be famous in Bethlehem&quot; and 2) &quot;may your house be like Perez&quot; (Gen 38:6-29). He also teaches us why this book is so valuable to Christians and Jews alike because of its call for faithfulness for grace and redemption.Chuck Missler's Tape Studies:I listen to Missler (and Dr. Fructenbaum's) tapes when driving in my car. They have greatly helped me extend my personal studies and spiritual growth while persevering under exceptionally arduous personal circumstances. (I will always have a special place in my heart for Missler's K-House because of the beautiful prayer one of his staff said with me just before I had to take my daughter off life support to end her life - you can read my daughter, Rebecca's story at littlestangel.com by going to the &quot;Questions&quot; page and clicking on the icon).Missler is great because he provides well-researched biblical studies while pushing the listener / reader into a wider realm with some well-identified, but reasonably founded speculations. Many times the listener won't agree with these speculations, but they are good for some spiritual and argumentative exercises. He fully discloses his references when he is on firm ground, as well as clearly states when he is venturing into speculative territory.The only negative is that I have the first version with the original notes. These notes are more sparse than the notes in Missler's more recent tape studies. But, the notes are deep enough and have the required bibliography. The more recent tape set may (or, may not) have updated notes - I don't know.Regardless, this is absolutely a must have tape set for every Christian."},{"Title":"Tiger the Lurp Dog","review":"Mopar is a LURP, an Airborne Ranger, an American Samurai and he's in the the middle of dense bush in the middle of a jungle in Vietnam. He's with a five-man recon team inserted many miles from friendlies to install people sensors and sniffers so that a firestorm of artillery can be called down invisibly on the heads of the NVA who control the area. Secondarily, the team is looking for the bones or dog tags of another LURP team that disappeared in the same area a while back. Mopar ignores the leeches that suck his blood, the many varieties of insects that sting him ceaselessly, ignores the heat, the broiling heat. He is armed to the teeth with a Swedish K-silenced-and a CAR-15. He carries an assortment of claymore mines and fragmentation grenades, a fighting knife honed sharp enough to shave with. He is proficient with all of them. He looks, and is, ferocious. He wears tiger stripe jungle fatigues and a floppy LURP hat. His face is camoflaged. He can go for days without food, without sleep, without moving his bowels. He is smart, he is cunning, and he is deadly. He neither gives nor expects mercy. A pure warrior. Mopar sits back to back with his team members in a night defensive position-to see all ways, always-and thinks &quot;This is the real world, here and now. Everything else is just frivolous civilian luxury&quot;. Mopar is nineteen years old.Mopar is one of the main characters in Kenn Miller's cult classic &quot;Tiger the LURP Dog&quot;, a book that is real, that is true. Mr. Miller doesn't waste a whole lot of time dwelling on the political and social upheaval the Vietnam war caused in the United States. There is some disparaging reference to a &quot;peace creep&quot; girlfriend back home, but that's about it. This is an authentic look at that unique and bold sub-strata of warrior, the men who conduct long range reconnaissance patrols in enemy territory. They fight for themselves, so much so that when a chaplain (&quot;...fat and reeking of after-shave and spray deodorant, sucking a life saver&quot;) is giving a &quot;God and Country&quot; sermon at a memorial for several of their fallen comrades, a LURP at the back of the formation mutters &quot;bulls**t&quot; loud enough for everyone to hear and they all snicker in agreement.Dialogue crackles and the pacing is swift. &quot;Tiger the LURP Dog&quot; deserves a better fate than the obscurity conferred by being labelled a &quot;cult classic&quot;."},{"Title":"Tiger the Lurp Dog","review":"I resently reread this book and it brought back great memmories.

In jump school and in the division we heard stories of lurps and rangers but did not really know what they did. This was the first book to go into detail about the life of lurps, and in my opinion this book is better than the fictional lurp books that followed.

The writing was as good as anything I've read in recent memory. Miller is one of the most honest and descriptive writers of this genre and hopefully this won't be his last novel.

It was Miller's first patrol into the sniping and murky world of the literary scene, where on-line pot shots and verbal ambushes wait lurking in cyberspace by those of lesser talent or skill.His writing and talent speaks for itself as Miller deftly brings the reader along on the dangerous patrols based on his two and half years- let me say that again- his two and half years of working as a LRRP/RANGER team member and team leader behind the lines with the U.S. Army's elite 101st Screaming Eagles. This remarkably well written book offers some valuable insight to that war experience and yet, entertains as well with good characters, good plotting and imagery.Miller is also an academic who speaks several dialects of Chinese fluently, had edited a good dozen or so other books, ghostwritten at least one or two other books, and and wrote one of the three SIX SILENT MEN books.With all of his credentials, accomplishments and skills I take satisfaction in knowing that at least I am taller than he is."},{"Title":"Tiger the Lurp Dog","review":"Kenn Miller is a very good writer.My intrest was kept at a peak all the way through the book.

For the scholar of neoteric poetry, Thomson's book is a must; undergraduates will find it too vast and too unconcerned with elementary matters (also with literary matters) but very helpful for bibliography on each poem (a role Quinn's text was growing a bit long in the tooth for). Graduate students are compelled to use this as their standard text. Thomson is at his best when unraveling the often diffuse manuscript tradition of this often-read, little-understood poet. For classicists with only a passing interest in Catullus and his work, Fordyce (supplemented by Quinn for the &quot;obscene&quot; poems) remains more than usable."},{"Title":"CATULLUS","review":"The Loeb Classical Library collects three poets of love together in one volume. First, Catullus is probably the most often studied poet of the group. The reading the poems and glancing across the page at the Latin original gives the reader a much stronger sense for how carefully crafted Catullus's verse is. The Loeb editon has been in circulation for about 90 years; however, it has recently been revised and reissued. Since Catullus was a little racy for the early 20th Century, many of his poems were translated into a very stilted form (or not translated at all). The new edition from Loeb corrects this and takes into account the 100 years of classical scholarship to produce a very authoratative and readable edition.Second, Tibullus presents an interesting case, because few if any of his poems can directly be attributed to him. This in and of itself may not merit much attention -- particularly after reading the textual introduction which described just how torured a path classical texts have walked in coming down to us today. The poems about Sulpicia are the real interest here in that they may be written by her.Finally, Tiberianus's Pervigilium Veneris attracts attention because it suggests the move away from classical poetry to Medieval forms.The Loeb edition is well crafted with sewn binding and acid-free paper. These poets have survived 2000 years, and the Loeb edition is sure to be valued for generations."},{"Title":"CATULLUS","review":"Catullus and Tibullus relatively belong to the same epoch in the history of Latin Poetry; and they also derive their inspiration through the same source--from Erato the Muse of Love Poetry. What one will encounter, then, while reading their works, is what may be perhaps the finest manifestation of Roman Love Poetry that has been passed over to us through the ages. With the exception of Propertius or Ovid, Catullus and Tibullus have no rival when it comes to the art of love poetry; and one may argue that the former poets only surpass the later in their bulk of extant poems and in their depth of subject-matter. Also included in this volume, is the Vigil of Venus, a warm and colorful poem attributed to a certain Tiberianus, who belongs to much later time, likely during the reign of the Antonines. As the introduction points out, the Vigil of Venus contains the first piece of Romanticism to be found in Western Poetry. It is a poem of exceptional merit, and it is not unworthy of the majesty of Catullus and Tibullus. Taken as a whole, students of Latin Literature, and poets of our day, have much to learn and enjoy by reading these noble classics."},{"Title":"CATULLUS","review":"Gaius Valerius Catullus was a contemporary of Julius Caesar and was known for his provocative poetry. In addition to Catullus, this great little edition by Loeb's has all of Tibullus (a later poet under the reign of Augustus) as well all in one edition.Although Catullus wrote many erotic or amorous poems to men (he was bi-sexual) and his lover Lesbia, many of his poems are actually invectives attacking some of his contemporaries such as Julius Caesar. One of his greatest invective works is the one against Egnatius which goes as follows:\\"Egnatius, because he has white teeth, is eternally smiling. If people come to the prisoner's bench, when the counsel for the defense is making everyone cry, he smiles: if they are mourning at the funeral of a dear son, when the distrought mother is weeping for her only boy, he smiles: whatever it is, wherever he is, whatever he is doing, he smiles: it is a malady he has, neither an elegant one as I think, nor in good taste. So I must give you a bit of advice, my good Egnatius. If you were a Roman or a Sabine or Tiburtine or a plump Umbrian or a fat Etruscan, or a black and tusky Lanuvian, or a Transpadane (to touch my own people too), or anybody else who washes his teeth with clean water, I still should not like you to be always smiling; for there is nothing sillier than a silly laugh. As it is, you are a Celtiberian; now in the Celtiberian country everyone regularly brushes his teeth and ruddy gums in the morning with his piss; so that, the more highly polished your teeth are, the more urine they will prove to have passed your lips.\\"If this type of poetry appeals to you, then you will probably like most of Catullus' works as well as other ancient Roman poetry.The Loeb library is unique in that its classical texts are printed in both the original Latin text and English side-by-side. The translations are quite good and were done by competent scholars of classics whose choice of language is accurate, clear, and modern. These hard bound volumes are small but their covers are durable: the paper is of good quality. Good companions to this text would be Loeb's editions of Ovid's works and those of Martial who lived later in the Empire."},{"Title":"CATULLUS","review":"This is a Catullus reader with all of his poems. It's a \\"loab\\" with the Latin on one side and English on the other. It should be in every Latin teacher's personal library. This copy arrived on time and in excellent condition."},{"Title":"CATULLUS","review":"I read all of the reviews on Amazon, but they all seem to refer to different editions than the one advertised. There are dozens of editions of Catullus, including at least two by Goold--but these two editions have quite different purposes. The Loeb edition has parallel texts, Latin and English, but no commentary. The advertised volume (ISBN 0715617109) is heavier on commentary and notes. I would like to see a review that evaluates this edition and its author's interpretations and opinions. In the meantime, the reader should ignore my rating of this item, I really don't know how good it is--just that the editor does have a distinguished reputation."},{"Title":"CATULLUS","review":"\\"Let him tomorrow who has never loved,and let him who has tomorrow love!\\"This review relates to the volume -Catullus,Tibullus, Pervigilium Veneris-, Second Edition,Loeb Classical Library # 6, ISBN: 0674990072.The original translations of Catullus (by F.W.Cornish), of Tibullus (by J. P. Postgate), andof the -Pervigilium Veneris- (by J. M Mackail)have now been updated for the better by G. P.Goold (his first 2nd edition appeared in 1988 --this reprint is dated 2000), and Goold'sIntroductory explanations for the state of thetranslations and the need for updates appearbefore each section of works (entire volume,Reviser's Note, Aug. 1987; Catullus, Reviser'sPreface 1987; Tibullus, Reviser's Preface, 1988;-Pervigilium Veneris-, Reviser's Preface, 1984).Catullus, perhaps the best known of the 3 sourcesof work in this volume, is an extremely interesting,if not fascinating person and/or character. He canbe rough and bawdy and cynical, and at other timesstricken, driven, haunted, and sympathetic. Hispoems are satiric attacks using \\"gutter language\\"and sexual accusations, name-calling (especiallyrelating to ... proclivities) --but they are also songs of pain, frustration, despair,self-criticism, and complaint. There are alsoexceptionally moving poems that recite the feelingsof the family and of himself over the loss of hisbrother. Many editions of Catullus use euphemisticlanguage to get around his direct rough talk, orthey simply excise the \\"offending\\" passages. Thankfully,this new edition restores the complete text withappropriate graphic translations which give one thesense of just what kind of an artist and personCatullus was. G.P. Goold says that he has usedW.H.D. Rouse's paraphrases of several of Catullus'poems because the paraphrases are so good. Thosepoems paraphrased by Rouse are: 15, 21, 37, 69, 71,74, 78, 79, 80, 89, 94, 97, 100, 110, 112, and 113.Here for those who can take it are the openinglines of 37 (paraphrased by Rouse): ...BR>Tibullus, on the other hand, is a bit quieter -- hisopening lines talk of pastoral peace (until he a littlelater starts talking to Delia and shows how driven heis, how under her spell -- and Love, oh Love -- thatmesmerizer, that seducer, that desired ideal). \\"I ama captive fast bound in the bonds of a lovely girl;I sit a janitor before her stubborn doors. I care notfor glory, Delia dear; let me only be with thee, andI will pray folk call me sluggard and idler.\\" \\"Butme, for I have been ever pliable to gentle Love, shallVenus' self escort to the Elysian fields.\\"-Pervigilium Veneris- \\"a poem of not quite a hundredlines celebrating a spring festival in honour of thegoddess of love, is remarkable both for its beautyand as the first clear note of romanticism whichtransformed classical into medieval literature.\\"The poem is divided into 3 sections with sub parts:Spring -- stanza I, The arrival of spring; stanzaII, The birth of Venus; stanza III, The budding of therose. The Festival -- stanza IV, Venus' message tothe nymphs; stanza V, The nymphs' message to Diana;stanza VI, The festival at Hybla. Litanies to Venus --stanza VII, As cosmic goddess of procreation; stanzaVIII, As tutelary goddess of Rome; stanza IX, As goddessof vegetation; stanza X, As goddess of animals and birds;and a personal epilogue at the end of the poem: \\"She sings,I am mute. When will my spring come? When shall I becomelike the swallow that I may cease to be voiceless? Ihave lost my muse through being voiceless, and Phoebus[Apollo] regards me not....\\"-- Robert Kilgore [acominatus, patroklos, Encolp1850.]"},{"Title":"CATULLUS","review":"I got this book for my boyfriend for christmas so I'm writing this review on his part.

He said that it's one of the greatest books he's ever read."},{"Title":"Words of Science","review":"In 'Words of Science' Isaac Asimov presents the etymology of some 1500 terms from physics, chemistry, mathematics, astronomy, geology, biology and medicine. Asimov traces words like alcohol, isosceles, monosaccharide and yttrium to their Greek, Latin, Arabic and vernacular roots. Discoveries and inventions, both great and obscure, as well as the men and women behind them, are presented in 250 entries of about a page each. We read of the German physicist Wilhelm Roentgen who, in 1895, applied the mathematical variable X to the mysterious rays whose properties he was exploring. Later, the rays were renamed 'Roentgen rays' in his honor, but because their discoverer's surname was so difficult to pronounce by English speaking scientists, the term 'X-rays' stuck. The superstitions and serendipity that comprise so much of scientific history are related with clarity and wit. For example, the Romans considered a freak birth or deformity to be an omen from the gods; hence, from the Latin word 'monere' (a warning) we get the word 'monster'. 'Words of Science' is a handy reference for any library and makes good bathroom reading."},{"Title":"Words of Science","review":"Isaac Asimov is a favorite writer because of his prodigious output of books before his death. In fact, he published over 500 works in science, language, Biblical history, in fact, nine out of ten of the Dewey Decimal categories (all except philosophy). During his lifetime he was one of the Big Three of science fiction writers (the other two were Arthur C. Clarke and Robert Heinlein).\\"Words of Science\\" is one of his works that crosses two genres: science and etymology (language). Asimov's own use of language is clear and easily processed. He states that one reason science is considered a \\"hard\\" subject is the scientific vocabulary. As he explains, Latin and Greek are international languages and still the language of science today. Because scientific words have the same meanings today as yesterday, any nationality can comprehend the meaning of science words. Since we no longer study Latin and Greek in school, actually discovering the meanings of words is still an exciting process of discovery.For example, we take the meaning of telephone for granted, but consider the etymology. \\"Tele\\" means \\"far off\\" and \\"phone\\" means \\"voice,\\" so when we pick up the receiver, we expect to hear \\"a far off voice.\\" He says that exploring the meaning of scientific vocabulary is really an adventure and \\"one of the most powerful attractions of science\\" (introduction)In \\"Words of Science\\" Asimov begins with \\"Absolute Zero.\\" He explains \\"zero longitude\\" (see Meridian) and \\"zero Celsius\\" (see Centigrade) at the point that ice melts. However, William Thomson extended the idea of this limit to cold. He treated temperature as \\"an expression of the velocity of movement of molecules in a substance\\" (1). The colder a substance, the slower the motion until motion ceases at -273.18 degrees C. Now this is a real zero with \\"absolute\\" as \\"freed from all restraint\\" or \\"absolute zero.\\"Fruit juices, which stand, ferment and become wine and, standing further, become sour. The expression \\"sour wine\\" in Old French is \\"vin egre\\" and later, vinegar. All this leads into the etymology of \\"acid\\" which is related to sourness. Asimov uses a page to explain each word's etymology and usually along the way several other words.Are you ready for \\"ammonia\\" and \\"amino acids\\" because the etymology of these related words is quite interesting and amusing. The Greeks not only spread their culture, but they also adapted the cultures of others into their own. An example is Amen or Amun, one of Egypt's gods. The Greeks built a temple to Zeus-Ammon (Amen) in the North African desert. As fuel was scarce and camel dung was plentiful, it was used in lighting the interior of the temple. The soot that settled contained salt-like crystals, called \\"sal ammoniac,\\" \\"sal\\" for \\"salt,\\" thus \\"salt of Ammon.\\" I'm skipping the long explanation, but \\"amino acids,\\" the most important substances in our bodies carry \\"a reference to the great god Amen of Egypt\\" (11).With the etymology of \\"erosion,\\" Asimov tells a whole history of geological terms. The movement of water from sky to earth and across land to the sea, dragging soil and pieces of rock with it, creating a new bed in the sea, is called erosion (\\"e-\\" \\"away, off, out\\" and \\"rodere,\\" \\"to gnaw,\\" so a \\"gnawing away\\" at the soil. Other related words include \\"gradient\\" or \\"steps\\" in the flowing, \\"cascade\\" from \\"cascare,\\" \\"to fall.\\" Then there is \\"meandering\\" from the Meander River in Asia Minor, and \\"canyon\\" from \\"canna\\" a reed, so Grand Canyon comes from a \\"grande\\" or large reed-like shape.The etymology for gravity is almost philosophical. First, he discusses \\"centrifugal\\" force from \\"centrum\\" or center and \\"fugere\\" \\"to flee\\" with the balancing force, \\"centripetal\\" from \\"petere\\" to move toward. All this leads to \\"gravis\\" or \\"heavy.\\" \\"[T]he attraction of one body for another is gravity and that is the centripetal force that holds the solar system together and everything on earth in place\\" (107). Don't you love it?There are 250 pages in \\"Words of Science,\\" meaning 250 words with one word per page. Other interesting words include hemophilia, hieroglyphic, duodenum, dynamo, meter, parsec, polymer, science, thermonuclear reaction, tide, trypsin, ungulate, virus, and lastly, zero. So we begin with absolute zero and end with zero. Oops, one last word, zodiac. Seven of the twelve constellations are animals. The Greek word for animal is \\"zoon\\" and the diminutive is \\"zodion.\\" In talking of the constellations, you are talking of the animals, so this whole thing is referred to \\"zodiac\\" today.In his inimitable way, Asimov makes words of science both fun and informative. You could keep his book on your bedside table, read a word and related words per day, and have a extended scientific vocabulary in two-thirds of a year."},{"Title":"Financing Change","review":"This work asks the question if the world's financial markets and those who work in and around them are a force for sustainable human progress, or if they are against it. Related to this question two more further, fundamental questions are asked : Do the financial markets encourage a short-termist,profits-only mentality that ignores much human and environmental reality ? Or are they simply tools that reflect human concerns, and so will eventually reflect disquiet over poverty and the degradation of nature by rewarding companies that treat people and the environment in a responsible manner ?In an attempt to find answers, the authors examined both the working of financial markets (established and emerging) and the roles of different key players in the financial community.The findings are mixed but overall encouraging. For each player the present situation is explained in detail, showing clearly the limitations, the potential risks and potentials each player has related to creating sustainable development.Overall a difficult topic in which the authors did very well to give a detailed present situation.

In brief, it is written as the journal of Edmund Talbot, composed for his godfather and patron, an English lord, during a journey from England to Australia sometime during the early 19th century. In particular, it deals with the events before, and the investigation subsequent to, the death of a parson who is also on board.Because of the setting, characters of diverse backgrounds are thrown into closer contact than they might otherwise have had. This means that notions of class and how it impacts upon individuals play an important part in the novel. Questions of faith and the effect that it has upon actions are also crucial. Ultimately this is a very human story (much as is Golding's most famous book \`Lord Of The Flies') as it deals with the way that people react when put into extreme (and not so extreme) circumstances.This is certainly a book worth reading on its own terms. However, it has also whet my appetite to find and read the other two books, \`Close Quarters' and \\"Fire Down Below'."},{"Title":"Rites of Passage","review":"It's the tail end of the Napoleonic wars and a superannuated warship makes its way very, very slowly from England to Australia. Among the passengers are Mr. Edmund Talbot, aristocrat, headed for a term as assistant to the Governor, thanks to the influence of his patron and godfather. He keeps a journal for the latter's eventual entertainment and we are treated to his stumbling attempts to understand the nautical world. Still, he's a gentleman and that smooths his way. He has various small adventures, social and amorous, all of it lighthearted to the reader. then we meet the Rev. Mr. Colley, newly frocked and headed for his first congregation, and a very different sort of personality from Talbot, not to mention the ship's officers and men. And from there the story begins a slide into a much darker place, culminating in the \\"rite\\" of Crossing the Line, when Mr. Colley is humiliated once too often, and subsequent events result in a funeral at sea. Golding has absolute control of his subject and his characters, sucking you into a consideration of the nature of Justice, and of the division between the social orders. This is not at all a \\"fun\\" book, but it's a very affecting one."},{"Title":"Rites of Passage","review":"I can't recall another first person narrative that is so effective in giving (apparent) authentic voice to a character as that given by Mr Golding to the young aristocrat Mr Edmund Talbot and how revealing that is of the times, the class system, dress, morality, habits, and so on, on a long sea voyage. Details of the ship itself, the characters that people it, and the events that occasion it on its journey, are masterfully drawn (so that's where - some of us - came from!) I also laughed out loud as it is richly comic as well (Dickens would have laughed out loud too I bet!) not least in the circumlocutions used by the narrator. A journey for him in a number of senses. Also one of the funniest lovemaking scenes I can recall ever having read.

Sea journeys of that era were long, tedious, largely uneventful and extremely uncomfortable. All 3 books in the trilogy carry this perfectly: the maritime atmosphere is conveyed as perfectly as the arrogant character of the narrator. However, the tedium of the journey also comes across in the virtually non-existent plot which makes the books drag on somewhat. It is probably, though, as brilliant description of the English class system at the start of the 19th century as you will read. I believe that the books in Trilogies should be able to stand alone, if they are to be sold separately, &amp; on that basis, this trilogy definitely fails.

I am not a trained psychiatrist, or sociologist, or ethnologist, so I am going to review the book from a layman's standpoint.In this work, Freud draws heavily on observations and theories of ethnology, emphasizing on studies of Australian aborigines and Frazer's work. He draws a parellel with his personal observations from treatment of \\"neurotic\\" patients and claims to have found common patterns in these two classes of subjects, which tend to explain certain social and psychological phenomena, as well as the \\"birth\\" of religion.He focuses on the concepts of \\"Totem\\" and \\"Taboo\\". While familiar with taboo (although our understanding of the term is narrower than Freud's), totem is remote to us. Certain aboriginal peoples were grouped in social groupings, centered on the cult of and belief of descent from a certain animal. So, you are the \\"Kangaroo tribe\\", we are the \\"Ostrich tribe\\" etc. The topic most interesting Freud, to which he devotes the first essay in the book, is \\"exogamy\\", i.e. marriage outside one's group. This practice of exogamy seems to be in contradiction to what is pursued by some ethnic groups in America (Jews and Greeks come to mind) i.e. \\"endogamy\\" - a push to have children marry within their parents' ethnic group. This practice of exogamy in Australian aborigines is attributed by Freud to fear of incest, with quite convincing arguments.What is challening is to concoct a theory that suggests totemism and exogamy are not orthogonal social institutions that just happenned to coexist, but intricately bound together. Freud accomplishes that through intricate reasoning that draws heavily on religion (in his 4th essay). His argumentation may seem far-fetched to many, but is plausible, although it is hard to get convinced that it is the single, or most probable, theory explaining the issue.Freud makes the analogy that what primitive people are to ethnography, \\"neurotics\\" are to psychoanalysis and tries to map patterns from one domain to the other. Another goal is to establish the theory of totemism as the primordial religion from which all known religions and beliefs have spawned over time. The fact that Hinduists rever and never kill cows, seems to me (my example, not Freud's) to support this theory; Hinduists could be considered an outgrowth of a \\"Cow totem\\". Also, in modern Judeochristian societies, the totem, for intermarriage avoidance, has been replaced by the blood relatives group. Greek civil law for instance, forbids marrying blood relatives to the 4th degree and relatives through marriage to the 3th degree (i.e. after marriage your also become a member of your spouse's \\"totem\\" - for life).His 2nd essay discusses the concept of taboo. He defines it as \\"a set of limitations that primitive people apply to themselves\\". He contends that people who do \\"taboo things\\" become taboo themselves (certainly prostitutes would fit that profile). In our modern society, one's car is taboo, such as one's tools and guns were in prehistory.Deists may have a hard time with Freud, especially since he states \\"we know well that just like gods, demons too are figments of the human imagination\\". Freud was an atheist and his train of thought is naturally and instictively atheistic, and this could be challenging for a deist.Amazing is how some taboos of primitive times, remain alive, even in a degenerate form, in our times. For instance, just as primitives of New Guinea don't eat meat after killing an enemy (a taboo), modern Greek Orthodox people don't eat meat in the lunch following the funeral ceremony (only fish and veggies allowed). Also, the \\"dirtiness\\" taboo, where primitives were subjected to purification ceremonies, seems to be alive in the Eastern Orthodox sacrament of baptism where the to-be-christened baby is washed in the baptisery. Female \\"uncleanliness\\" during menstruation is also taboo in the Eastern Church; women are never allowed in the santum (blood taboo). It is considered taboo in Greek to say that a woman is menstruating, whereas politeness calls to say that \\"she feels sick\\". Also, the death taboo is alive in an incomprehensible to me (but \\"self-evident\\" to them as Freud would say) avoidance by many to refer to cancer by its name, opting instead the expressions \\"the bad thing\\" or \\"the cursed disease\\".Also, the taboo, Freud mentions, whereby the archpriest of Zeus in Rome, was forbidden to ride horses, seems to be alive, in that the heads of states rarely drive cars themselves, but are rather given a ride by their chauffers. Regarding king-priests, last time I checked the Queen of England was also the head of the Church of England...The third essay (animism and magic) is also important. Interestingly, Freud considers animism as the only weltanschaung completely and comprehensively (albeit incorrectly) explaining world's nature. He does not believe that subsequent religious and scientific weltanschaungen have achieved this. The animism->religion->science progression of world views discussed is extremely important and core for understanding his work. I guess that were he alive and learned that 90% of Americans are religious (Source: Euronews) he would be rather skeptical of the \\"progress\\" of mankind...In his fourth essay, he returns to totemism, reaching the culmination of this work, in an awe-inspiring scene, where the young brothers kill and devour their own father. This vivid scene of patricide, which he subsequently manages to mitigate, suggesting the possibility that it was perpetrated only in people's minds (temptation), he proclaims as the original sin of mankind, which young males throughout the millenia try to redeem. This theory is highly controversial, albeit very interesting and thought-provoking. This scene is worth the whole book not only for its intensity, but also for the dexterity with which Freud creatively combines and correlates findings from fields so diverse, such as psychiatry, psychology, sociology, ethnology, religion, and philosophy, along with deep understanding of the human psyche, to reach a conclusion of such importance, and arguably impact, regarding who we are, and why we are doing things the way we are."},{"Title":"Totem and taboo;: Resemblances between the psychic lives of savages and neurotics,","review":"And this time trough those primitive manifestations performed by that very primitive peoples like aborigenes from Australia, North and South America indians and many others discovered by colonization european, manifestation that we are used to call by Totem and Taboo. This is the standard Freud's view on the subject and to understand this book is a necessary step to proceed to other important Freud's work like Moses and Monotheism, The Future of an Ilusion and many others, where he approaches with reluctance the idea of religion as an offspring of early animism.The prior standard way of seeing these types of primitive manifestation was to see them trough the amount of dread the primitive men have against the manifestation of some praeternatural agency, to use a term used by Mr.Thorstein Veblen, a contemporary of Freud, in his magnificent book on the leisure class (The Theory of the Leisure Class). It is worthy to note that nobody can be sure on the origins of this type of tradition and that adds substance to Mr.Freud's arguments.Sigmund Freud goes a step further to the classical view and says that totemism and taboo as animism are the manifestation of something not outside ourselves but rather inside human minds of the primitive people, where the unconscious played a good part to the forming of this kind of culture manifestation and where there is an intricate and unconscious and almost mathematical calculation in order to attribute to the priest-king, who typifies the carrier of this tradition, both the pleasures and the burden of the function. In Freud's view, both totem and taboo are traditions that have to find their origim in the unconscious of that primitive folks and not in the concurrence of fear to the dead, following the tradition of his many other books on the latent manifestations of the unconscious. The ritual and actual killing of the father by the Horde or Band of Brothers, who are in search of vital space for their development, is the real reason behind all that happens afterwards and, following Freud's hypotheses, are the groundwork of modern and ancient religion.The concepts here explained will be fundamental to the development of the hypotheses developed latter in Moses and Monotheism."},{"Title":"Totem and taboo;: Resemblances between the psychic lives of savages and neurotics,","review":"I am referring to the Thaisunset edition in this review (black cover with slightly incongruous topless native woman illustration). The content of Freud's book is still interesting today, of course. The Brill translation is stiff and somewhat old-fashioned but certainly enjoyable.This edition has problems. Though attractively produced and clearly typeset it contains many typographical errors. It also makes the bizarre decision to place the footnotes in the text, indented, proceded with both a number and a little bracketed notification that the footnote is about to begin, and then followed by a similar notification that the footnote is over and we can all relax now. I gather that the text is in the public domain and the publisher has released it with minimal formatting. Very disappointing. It is still readable, but is certainly not what I expected."},{"Title":"Totem and taboo;: Resemblances between the psychic lives of savages and neurotics,","review":"Totem and Taboo, along with _The Future of an Illusion_, should be necessary reading for any serious student of social science. Of course, there are massive holes in Freud's arguments (such as his tendancy to make sweeping generalizations about other cultures from his armchair in Europe), but people who disagree with him for moral and ethical reasons tend to amplify those holes and simply ridicule Freud the man instead of intelligently approaching his arguments.The fact is, his suppositions about parental relations (as they relate to &quot;totem&quot; cultures), about religion, and about sexuality are extremely relevant and have proven, over the years, to possess an extraordinary predictive power. Even if one disagrees with this literature, one should read it and know exactly what they disagree with."},{"Title":"Totem and taboo;: Resemblances between the psychic lives of savages and neurotics,","review":"A much better book by Freud then the last of his I read. He leaves much of the quirkier and insane aspects of his ideas out. What we get instead is a pseudo-anthropological look at the origins of primitive spiritual and religious practices.The main line of arguments in this book go something like this. All cultures have taboos, the more primitive a culture is, the more superstitions it has tied to its taboos, these superstitions come to make an overarching framework that take on a life of their own. This framework eventually settles itself into a new religion. Becoming a commanding justification for the taboos and rules set out by these cultures. He also restates and attempts to put forward his general theory on how monotheistic religion developed. Which goes something like this:Before civilization, there was something akin to herds of humans roaming the lands. At one point a father/patriarchal figure rose above the rest and kept all the women in a harem to himself. The sons rebelled against this father for want of more resources and women and eventually killed him. Although they were pleased with the overall outcome all of them felt pangs of guilt for killing the father. So they made him a spiritual figure and built a religion around him to be an example of their past transgression and a way of keeping a general order in society through his taboo hypothesis as stated above.Historically there are many holes in Freud's beliefs here. His views of how monotheism developed are almost certainty false. His views on taboos and primitive cultures however may have some truth to them in a humanistic sense. While it certainty wouldn't be true for all cultures it may explain how some religions and spiritual beliefs develop. I'm not really for or against his ideas in this so much as I find them slightly intriguing.I would recommend it to those interested in Freud and in religion/myth."},{"Title":"Totem and taboo;: Resemblances between the psychic lives of savages and neurotics,","review":"Though Freud's content is fascinating, this edition is horrible.

The investigation of totemism does no more than declare that 'here is what psycho-analysis can at the moment contribute towards elicidating the problem of the totem.'\\"Here are some representative quotations from the book:\\"We have arrived at the point of regarding a child's relation to his parents, dominated as it is by incestuous longings, as the nuclear complex of neuroses.\\"\\"Taboo is a primeval prohbition forcibly imposed (by some authority) from outside, and directed against the most powerful longings to which human beings are subject. The desire to violate it persists in their unconscious ... the fact that the violation of a taboo can be atoned for by a renunciation shows that renunciation lies at the basis of obedience to taboo.\\"\\"The original animal sacrifice was already a substitute for a human sacrifice---for the ceremonial killing of the father; so that, when the father-surrogate once more resumed its human shape, the animal sacrifice too could be changed back into a human sacrifice. The memory of the first great act of sacrifice thus proved indestructible.\\"\\"There was an alternative method of allaying their guilt and this was first adopted by Christ. He sacrified his own life and so redeemed the company of brothers from original sin.\\"\\"There can be no doubt that in the Christian myth the original sin was one against God the father. If, however, Christ redeemed mankind from the burden of original sin by the sacrifice of his own life, we are driven to conclude that the sin was a murder.\\"\\"I should like to insist that ... the beginnings of religion, morals, society and art converge in the Oedipus complex.\\""},{"Title":"Totem and taboo;: Resemblances between the psychic lives of savages and neurotics,","review":"Totem and Taboo was originally published (from 1912-1913) in the journal Imago as four essays. These essays are \\"The Horror of Incest\\", \\"Taboo and Emotional Ambivalence\\", \\"Animism, Magic and the Omnipotence of Thoughts\\", and \\"The Return of Totemism in Childhood\\".I am neither a psychologist nor a trained anthropologist. I came to this book after reading Frazer's The Golden Bough-- a friend of my suggested that it made a good counterpoint, both in terms of period and subject. As a lay person, I found it clear and interesting to read. I have enough familiarity with Freud's basic theses that I did not find that I was lost.I found the last essay, \\"The Return of Totemism in Childhood\\" to be the strongest. At least for me, it was the strongest in that it synthesized the ideas from the earlier essays and drew the broadest ideas and conclusions.The Peter Gay biographical introduction was a nice refresher, particularly for someone who is not a Freud scholar."},{"Title":"Totem and taboo;: Resemblances between the psychic lives of savages and neurotics,","review":"Psychoanalytic literature can be confounding to clinicians and lay people alike.

The insightful quotes are concise and deep, and makes you think. It's perfect for people who make little time during the day to feed their souls--and in a case like that, any food to a starving soul is good food. And in my opinion this is the best \\"fast food for the soul\\" I've personally come across.

The driving forces in this book are man's faith in God and some people's lack of; trust and loyalty, in both friendship and love, and the incredible inner strength one can muster up in the face of seemingly impossible odds.Cut short, it's a paranormal who-done-it intertwined with an amazing amount of factual research into the realm of the supernatural, where the two highest powers are constantly at odds - God and Satan. But it's how the characters become entangled in this power struggle that makes this novel so fascinating.He brings to light his character's flaws and weaknesses in the same manner he does their shining traits, making them real and believable.But the crux of the story is how a shroud, remarkably similar to the infamous Shroud of Turin, mysteriously appears after a helpless innocent is corrupted in the most heinous manner imaginable. Everyone wants answers regarding this event - the police, scientists, scholars and debunkers, and most importantly, the small circle of friends closest to this poor soul who left his mark on this new shroud. But no one will get them without a major leap of faith: acknowledging that there *are* supernatural events, both good and evil, that occur in this world that cannot be explained by modern science.Jeff Messenger's knowledge of both the actual Shroud of Turin and the historical facts that back up it's legitimacy are paralleled only by his knowledge of supernatural occurrences, and he blends them perfectly with credible characters and a very original story line. At times it's terrifying, culling from the author's actual knowledge of how supernatural and demonic forces can and do walk this earth and often wreak on mankind, and at times it's heartwarming, especially when the hero is forced to reconcile himself to the fact that the world he has built for himself is not a perfect house of cards, but one that can only be kept together by his willingness to accept that stronger powers, both good and evil, often do orchestrate the world we live in.But it's the surprise ending that will make you blink - and make you look forward to his next published work, whatever avenue that may explore ...Barbie Heid and Dave Considine,Phantasm Psychic Research"},{"Title":"The Shroud of Torrington","review":"The Shroud of Torrington is a work of fiction that includes much research. It's a story that includes Christian research, Shroud of Turin research and paranormal phenomena. Unlike most books written from a Christian world view, it also references research and theories that go against the author's philosophic thrust.Whether or not one likes the philosophic thrust of this book, one will find it hard to put down.

Van Vogt. This is a great story if you appreciate early sci-fi circa 1951. I would also suggest his book, \\"War Against The Rull\\". If you are going to look for this book, \\"Weapon Shops of Isher\\", try to get the Ace Double-D version with Murray Leinster's \\"Gateway To Elsewhere\\" included. A two books in one issue. Pretty rare and you'll pay for it."},{"Title":"The Weapon Shops of Isher","review":"In \\"The Weapon Shops of Isher\\", AE van Vogt deals with libertarian philosophy that is best summarized by the slogan he attributes to the weapon shops, \\"The right to buy weapons is the right to be free\\". Unlike what many potential readers might imagine, this is not a manifesto for the National Rifle Association. It's a much more soft pedalled carefully considered cautionary tale that is a warning to citizens to be sure they retain the ability to limit the potential power of any government regardless of the form it might take.Time travel, immortality, the limitation of government power, corruption, invisibility, loyalty, naivete, love, courage, freedom, rebellion, powerful weaponry - all these themes and more are touched on in what many people call a fine example of the golden age of science fiction. But - and I'm willing to admit that perhaps the shortcoming is my own - I frankly failed to understand the charm and I didn't really catch the message. It bothers me to no end when I get to the end of a story and my sole reaction is \\"Huh ... what just happened?\\"Certainly I understood the basic themes but I felt that van Vogt missed the mark. The story line was difficult to follow and consisted of a hodge-podge of disconnected outrageous scientific conjectures, stilted dialogue far worse than sub-title translations of Japanese B-movies, blinding plot jumps and the use of plot devices that seemed arbitrary and pointless (Hedrock's immortality and a gambler with luck that defies all imagination, for example).In \\"Voyage of the Space Beagle\\", van Vogt wrote a series of stories that were clearly the predecessors of today's much loved Star Trek series. As a fan of classic science fiction, a lover of Star Trek in all its incarnations and a reader who has enjoyed van Vogt's other works, I wanted very much to like \\"The Weapon Shops of Isher\\". A cynical world-weary friend of mine put it well, \\"Vast ideas, but only half-vast execution!\\" Four stars for the ideas, two stars for the writing and the story to support it - call it three stars and suggest that this is a book which would be enjoyed only by hard core classic sci-fi lovers.Paul Weiss"},{"Title":"The Weapon Shops of Isher","review":"Sounds like a blurb from the NRA, but in fact this slogan is one of the lynch-pins of one of the most complicated and headlong adventures that van Vogt (often called the master of the re-complicated story) ever wrote.The Weapon Shops, like many of his stories, was actually written and published as several stories before being collected and somewhat edited into book form. In this case, the major portions were published as \\"The Seesaw\\" (Astounding, July 1941), \\"The Weapon Shop\\" (Astounding, Dec 1942), and \\"The Weapon Shops of Isher (Thrilling Wonder Stories, Feb. 1949). It is important to note the age of these stories, written as they were during the so-called \`Golden Age' of science fiction, when ideas were far more important than character or great prose style. This book is absolutely replete with ideas, but the prose, dialogue, and character development certainly leave something to be desired when compared to modern novels. While reading this book you need to let the story line and ideas overwhelm you, and ignore some of the more blatant excesses in writing style.It starts with a Weapon Shop magically appearing in a 1950 neighborhood. When a policeman attempts to open its door, he finds it locked - but when a newspaperman tries it just a minute later, it opens - and the newspaperman finds himself in the Isher Empire, which has been around for 4700 years, and where the Weapon Shops effectively form the \`opposition' to this government. This is plot thread number one. The second thread is that of a young man wishing to leave his provincial village and make his fortune in the big city - where he finds that he is a \`callidetic giant', able to beat any game of chance, and ends up amassing a fortune so large that he can upset the economic stability of the Empire. Thread three involves the world's only immortal, Robert Hedrock, who was instrumental in establishing both the Empire and the Weapon Shops, the first to provide a stable form of government, the second to ensure that the Empire can neither stagnate nor become an unopposed dictatorship. Stir in invisibility, time travel, and the secret of faster-than-light propulsion and you have an explosive mix that will keep you turning pages as fast as you can (and don't you dare think about the plausibility of any of this!).I think I first read this book around 1960, when I was about twelve, and many of the images of this book made a large impression on me: the casinos and their very futuristic gambling machines, the giant computer that kept track of all the vital statistics of every person in the solar system, the idea of waging war by shifting in time, the \`brothels' of the day, even the \`energy weapons' that the Weapon Shops sold. Reading it today, these same items still fascinate - and the ending is still an explosive bang.The thematic point of the right to have weapons strong enough to protect the individual from any government excesses is a major one, and certainly was very topical when it was written at the height of WWII. However, this point is not examined very closely for its downside, because in the story such weapons could \`sense' whether or not the person purchasing it had the appropriate mental outlook - an easy way out of the problems seen by today's society with too many weapons freely available to almost anyone.This is possibly his strongest novel, certainly at least as good as his Slan and The World of Null-A, as here all the various ideas and plot threads do seem to come together in a cohesive whole, something that could not be said about a lot of his works. And it is a pell-mell, head-over-heels, fun and fascinating read.--- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)"},{"Title":"The Weapon Shops of Isher","review":"This book and its sequel &quot;The Weapon Makers&quot;,together make up one of the best old sci fi series.

What happens to the reader is that as the political tension fades, the story of the young, supernaturally lucky young man who leaves the boonies to seek his fortune in the capital comes to the fore.So this is only partly a story about weapons and freedom.

The rebels are fronted by weapon shops because they, like many libertarians today, believe that personal liberty is expressed by by the right to bear arms (ie, the right to defend yourself from criminals, even if they are governments). By the end, however, we have almost no glimpse of the illicit society. A modest look at the totalitarian one. And almost none of the philosophical underpinnings. But that's typical Alfred Elton van Vogt. His works are often vague and mystifying.Reportedly, van Vogt exploited his dreams for some of his plotting which may explain why this one unfolds in a dreamlike way, morphing from one setting into another, often winding up in fantastical environs. Unfortunately, in this case, the story meanders around the periphery of the conflict between the monarchy and the weapons shops.Here, like in too many of his stories, van Vogt's characters are blanks without depth or personality. All they do is justify the quotation marks. (The exceptions are van Vogt's supermen, who exude confidence, and his alien creatures, who are generally primitive and animal whatever their technological level.)Probably because van Vogt wasn't a trained scientist, he blithely took science to the n-th degree -- a million million years into the past, a gigantic floating store, immortals, etc. Such concepts were new and daring when van Vogt began writing.In the end, like many of his other stories, this one moves quickly. Probably due to his system of stringing together 800-word mini-dramas to form the whole.I almost never remember a van Vogt plot. But I do remember that is was a good ride. And I'm surprised and delighted that for the fraction of his writing life devoted to the weapon shops, van Vogt spoke libertarian."},{"Title":"The Weapon Shops of Isher","review":"This book contains little if any violence but it serves,to remind one and all. of why the second amendment exists, to allow the populace to defend it'self against the G'ovt."},{"Title":"Knight in Shining Armor: Discovering Your Lifelong Love","review":"Follow the instructions that P.B.

It was the second read in 1996 that changed my life. I went away to graduate school in Jerusalem in the summer of 1996. When I got there, I was one of the only Christians in the program. I was hung up on a guy at home at the time and brought the book with me to go through and try to get over him. While I was there, I met my friend Asha who remains my best friend to this day. She was another Christian and shortly after we'd moved into our student apartments, she came over to talk while I was unpacking. She couldn't believe it when she saw that I had the \\"Knight in Shining Armor\\" book. She'd also brought the book along. She'd also read it once and she was hung up on a guy at home too. We decided that during our year in Israel for graduate school, we would make use of that book and create a 6 month weekly plan going over every portion of the book, then we met every Sunday night to discuss. We started on November 10, 1996 and finished on May 10, 1997. For our finish date, we decided to take what we called our \\"Knight in Shining Armor\\" tour. We decided to go to the Galilee. We started in Cana which we thought was fitting. We spent the night at a convent in Nazareth, went ice skating near the border of Lebanon, spent a lot of time near the Sea of Galilee and then I got baptized in the Jordan River. We took a picture of ourselves holding the book standing near the Jordan River and then sent the picture with a note to P.B. Wilson. Bunny wrote back to us almost right away. She invited us on a cruise for Christian singles who'd read the book. We really did not consider anything like that because we were sure that when we went home, those guys we'd been hung up on would be waiting for us and we'd get married and all would be well. We'd read the book, we were prepared. Well, of course that didn't happen, so we like to say that we, \\"missed the boat\\" since we skipped the cruise. We continued to celebrate May 10th, the day we'd finished our Knight in Shining Armor program over the years. Several years later when I got engaged in Dec. of 2003 and called my friend Asha, she knew what my wedding date would be. May 10th. We observed that it would be exactly 7 years from our May 10 completion date and 7 is the number of completion in the Bible. So Asha flew out for my wedding on Maui and it was a great day. I've been married almost 7 years now. My friend Asha is not married yet. We both still hope that she will marry one day. When Asha gets married, we'll really have the end to our \\"Knight in Shining Armor\\" success story.

It is so healing to read through it and to be able to deal with problems that have been bothering me for some time. She encourages accountability and getting your relationship with the Lord to first priority before starting a courtship with a guy.

If you care for some advice from a mature, disillusioned, charming Christian woman, buy the book! You won't regret it. :)P.S.

However, it is true; I have always been interested in how females think especially when it comes to relationships with guys. To begin with what attracted me to this book was the title. I have tried to live my life according to a code of chivalry and am curious about things associated with modern-day knights. With that said, I must say I was somewhat disappointed with this book. Granted it does contain several good messages (e.g. a person's ultimate worth is found in Christ, not a spouse) that need constant repeating in our society. However, as I was reading this book I couldn't help but feel that the book was really a &quot;how to find a mate&quot; book disguised as something else. In fact, much of the book is layed out in a step-by-step approach. Though a lot of the advice is good, some of it isn't. Also, there is no guarantee that you will find a mate if you follow all the advice in this book (the book actually never guarantees you will find a mate if you follow it's plan, however it is strongly hinted at). That's the problem with many relationship books, they offer a step-by-step plan to follow for a successful relationship, but there is no set plan that will work for everyone. God is a master Artist and everytime He does something, he does it a little different; nothing is done the same way twice. Of course, maybe the advice in this book is a lot better than I found it to be, after all I'm the one in my middle 20's who's never dated."},{"Title":"Knight in Shining Armor: Discovering Your Lifelong Love","review":"I wish I had this book when I first started dating!

I have read the book several times as it is very easy reading and gives so much information from a biblical point of view. The book points out that we are to obey God and His principles, put Him first place in our lives then &quot;He will give us the desires of our heart.&quot; Many Christians may not know what God teaches us in His word about dating and marriage.

After the last date that I had to receive the book had past, I contacted the seller. The seller gave me a tracking number for the US postal service. The post office said, that the book was returned because the address on the package was not readable. Then the seller said they would send the book back to me when they got the book back. A few days later the seller contacted me saying that they don't have the book in stock and that Amazon.com had made a mistake and had not updated their records, so they had actually sold out of the book. Well, what did they send me initially? Then the seller said that I would be getting a refund for the book. My money has been returned to my account but I really did want that book. I am so disappointed and I will never purchase anything from this seller again. The price was good initially, but I guess they found someone who would pay more for the book."},{"Title":"Knight in Shining Armor: Discovering Your Lifelong Love","review":"Honestly, I really didn't like this book very much. Maybe it was just me, but I feel like I've read a lot of Christian singles books that have been better. I think a lot of my problem was that I didn't relate to the author at all. It seemed like she continued on and on about her husband and children and obviously as a single person that's doesn't connect with me. There were some very good parts of the book where I connected with what she was saying and very deeply with God, but I felt those moments were rare and buried amongst a lot of mundane things. If you haven't read it yet, you might like it, but I would recommend borrowing it from a friend rather than buying it."},{"Title":"Knight in Shining Armor: Discovering Your Lifelong Love","review":"There is so about this book that is negative. I agree w/the other posters who mention the whole \\"take 6 months to get ready for your future husband\\" being unproductive. I even resent the title - \\"Knight In Shining Armor\\" - it's encouraging women to look to a man as a \\"savior\\" and put him on some kind of pedestal. I resent the implication that some man is out there just waiting to whisk in and \\"save\\" me from my miserable life of singleness.She actually says to keep in mind that the man that you agree to marry will have the \\"right\\" to make every final decision concerning YOUR life the instant you say \\"I do\\". Huh? What is this - 1905? Jesus NEVER says this in the Bible, nor does He even insinuate it! Women are equal to men in the eyes of God and we are all totally free in Christ! There is no \\"slave or free-man, no Jew or Gentile, no male or female.\\" He sees no difference - we are all HUMAN. Apparantly Ms. Wilson failed to read this verse...But by far, the most destructive message comes later in the book where Ms. Wilson is discussing the \\"for better or worse\\" clause that comes with marriage. She actually says in it that women who are physically abused can leave the behavior, but not the man! Then she goes on to say that we, as human beings (read: women), are equipped to handle verbal abuse!! Unbelievable! She obviously knows NOTHING about women living in the hell that is an abusive marriage, whether it be physical, verbal, or emotional. The audacity that she shows in making these kind of statements shocks me! Jesus came to set the oppressed free! If an abused women doesn't fit the definition of oppressed, then I don't know what or who does!Basically I'd advise you to save your money. This kind of destructive, religious teaching is the exact kind of stuff that Jesus questioned the pharisees on."},{"Title":"Knight in Shining Armor: Discovering Your Lifelong Love","review":"My friend recommended and lent me this book. I coulnd't get into it, so I stopped, prayed, thinking I needed to change my attitude. As I continued reading I realized my attitude had nothing to do with it. She started talking about how she devoted her life to God as a single woman, yet in later chapters talked about how her attitude toward her husband could have caused their marriage to fail. The author contradicts herself between the 1st and 3rd chapters. Her examples seem to have been made up to fill in the pages. She's talking as though if a single woman simply follows her \\"simplistic\\" formula, she'll find mate in 6 months. I started the 4th chapter and I had enough. After I read the \\"You married your father\\" part, I closed it for good. She implied that whether or not you grew up with a dad, you'll marry someone like your father. It's almost as if it's a subconscious choice that one has no control over. I would not recommend this book this to a single woman or to anyone for that matter..."},{"Title":"Knight in Shining Armor: Discovering Your Lifelong Love","review":"This book was recommended to me by a friend. After the first chapter, I was sceptical. It asks you to sign a paragraph stating that you want to set aside 6 months to prepare yourself for your future husband. It seems as though the entire book is built around you doing things so that you can get a husband. Becoming a better person is just a means to an end - getting a man. While all of the suggested things to work through are great, and a lot of what 'Bunny' has to say is good, the reason for doing them is not. I believe one should work on their character so that they can become more godly and Christ-like, not so that after putting in 6 months of time, God will act like a vending machine and give that person a husband."},{"Title":"Knight in Shining Armor: Discovering Your Lifelong Love","review":"Book has a good message, but will be extremely confinding for some. I recommend each reader to just take out of it, what may apply to you and your lifestyle. Even if you're a devoted Christian, the fact remains that wheather we like it or not, we are living as humans in the world. And so few of us could live as the book suggests we live. So are we doomed? Will God not forgive us? I don't think so! But I will say it requires a great deal of discpline and strength to be a full Christian. And if so, this book is for you."},{"Title":"Knight in Shining Armor: Discovering Your Lifelong Love","review":"It is my heart desire that every single woman will read this book. My marriage is a beautiful result of my reading this book and allowing God to minister to me while under construction. How beautiful God's love is, because it comes from the heart. A lot of times, people - yes, even Christians, will look on the outside rather than the inside. This is where we miss the mark, miss what God has in store for us, and who He has chosen to be our mates. Let go and Let God! Look what the Lord has done for me, and he will do the same for you.

Being a single guy I felt it was kind of &quot;taboo&quot;. Today however, I look back and am speechless. God has used this book to radically transform my relationship with Him. I now understand what it means to have a hunger and passion for God. P. B. has helped me to see the heart of &quot;true Christianity&quot; - to seek God first above all things. His Love in Christ can fill even the deepest desire in your heart. Read this book!

I have shared this book with several of my friends and am buying 3 more copies even as we speak. And by the way, 2 years after I read this book, I am marrying the ONE man God intended for me. He matches the characteristics of the godly man that are described in the book and I might have missed him, if I hadn't been &quot;reconstructed.&quot; This book will change your life if you are willing. Please get it and let God work in your life."},{"Title":"Knight in Shining Armor: Discovering Your Lifelong Love","review":"I began reading this book when some my friends started seeing their soon to be mates. I felt like something might be wrong with me due to pass relationships that God had not sent my mate. I could totally relate with the woman in the first chapter who runs out of the room crying because of her relationship insecurities. I was really excited about what God would do during the 6 month period of consecration. For 4 months now God has really been processing the relational issues that I have concerning dating. He has really pin-pointed scars from past hurts and has been working through them with me. The book helped me to face those scars and not to be afraid of them. I've really grown closer to the Lord through it all. I have to admit though that I am anxious to see what God has waiting for me at the end of 6 months. And even if it's not a husband I have become a much better person because of the message sent through this book. Develop your spiritual relationship first then the rest will follow."},{"Title":"Knight in Shining Armor: Discovering Your Lifelong Love","review":"&quot;Knight in Shining Armour&quot; helped me to build a foundation for living a VICTORIOUS SINGLE CHRISTIAN life. It helped me to kill the nagging distraction of wondering &quot;When God When&quot; (which enabled me to focus on preparation.) Once I was no longer worried about &quot;WHEN&quot;, I was freed up to truly minister to the Lord and others FREELY.After a failed engagement back in late 1996 and having tried life and dating the &quot;world's way&quot; as a Single Christian Woman, and reaping the fruit from that, I re-dedicated my life to Jesus Christ and began to draw closer to God through prayer and bible study. Very soon afterward, God began teaching me what it meant to be a Woman of God through His Word and certain anointed Christian books. As I began to renew my mind on what it really meant to be a Christian woman, the Lord led me to this book. This book became my &quot;textbook&quot; on being Single and Christian and preparing for a Godly marriage. After finishing the book, my faith was strong and I began to confidently STAND IN FAITH believing God for a Godly husband. At that time, I also made a commitment to handling my life GODS WAY from that time forward. .In 1999, the Lord brought the most wonderful man of God (my KNIGHT IN SHINING ARMOUR) into my life. In 2000, after a God-honoring courtship (no sex before marriage), we we're married. Having recently celebrated our 1st anniversary, I often think back to what helped me to live a VICTORIOUS life as a SINGLE Christian woman, and it all started with &quot;Knight in Shining Armour&quot;.If you are a Single, Christian Woman who is believing God for a husband, take it from me - God can do exceedingly abundantly above all you could ask or think and INFINITELY BEYOND YOUR HIGHEST DESIRES, HOPES, AND DREAMS *IF* you commit to preparing for a Godly courtship and marriage HIS WAY. He will honor your commitment to doing things HIS WAY and He will deliver in a big way --- FOR HIS GLORY. Marriage is honorable and God is FOR marriage, therefore, desiring marriage is a Godly desire. Make the commitment and standfast believing for a Godly husband -- no matter what it looks like or seems like, you keep believing. &quot;Knight in Shining Armour&quot; will give you some direction on how to prepare yourself for a Godly courtship and marriage."},{"Title":"Knight in Shining Armor: Discovering Your Lifelong Love","review":"Myself and two other women read the book together and within one month of starting our no-dating committment of six months (which is recommended by Bunny), we met our future husbands-to-be.

That is, for 10 identical and very small paperbacks - a parcel measuring 14 inches by 8 inches by 2 inches - we paid the exorbitant postage and handling charge of 129 USD for the books to be sent to Australia!!! When I brought this massive overcharge up with Amazon, the reply was very much 'take it or leave it'. I wonder if Amazon doesn't have enough competitors?

Initially published in 1906, it contains the collected writings of Shoemaker, who traveled the region extensively in the years leading to the turn-of-century. Some of the stories are tall tales, while others are specific accounts of things witnessed in his travels. I don't find a boring story here, and its a great window to a time not really so far away, but so, so different in a lot of real ways.There's ghost stories, stories of feuds, stories of travels, and of attempted enterprises dashed by the frequent moves of a racehorse. I believe there's only one or two mentions of an automobile. There are lots of conversations with Civil War veterans, and even a hermit from France, who lived on the side a mountain just north of Clearfield, Pennsylvania (not too far from Penn State, if you're not familiar with it).Just a real enjoyable read, which continues to awe and inspire others, including a similar volume collected in the 1970-80s by a professor at Mansfield College (Flatlanders & Ridgerunners).

This book doesn't really meet these requirements. The Enlightenment is structured as a series of linked essays on important topics related to the Enlightenment. These include the social context of the Enlightenment, government and the Enlightenment, gender and the Enlightenment, etc. There is a short introductory chapter which is primarily devoted to historiography of the Enlightenment. The essays are generally quite good but don't really provide the needed overview or basic narrative to accomplish the stated aims for books in this series. This book is most useful as a series of summaries of recent scholarship on the Enlightenment and can be used most usefully by someone who already has significant knowledge in this area. For teachers, I'd recommend using this book as an ancillary to a basic narrative text or even in conjunction with something like Peter Gay's magisterial overview of the Enlightenment. For general readers, this book is most useful as a review of recent scholarship.To the extent that this book has a theme, it would be the increasing appreciation of the diversity and complexity of the Enlightenment. Outram takes pains to show Enlightenment positions are being more variable than often presented. Following the work of others, she is concerned with rebutting or undermining what has been regarded as a canonical view derived from scholars like Peter Gay that the Enlightenment can be summarized as a liberal reform program. For Outram, as for others, The Enlightenment as a unitary phenomenon does not exist. She, like others, also objects to the tendency to align the Enlightenment with a relatively small group of French intellectuals. Much of this is well taken, and Outram's individual essays are very informative. The discussions of government and the Enlightenment, religion and the Enlightenment, and science and the Enlightenment are particularly good.On the other hand, there problems with some of her thematic analysis. While the Enlightenment cannot perhaps be easily summarized, at least not in the way suggested by scholars like Peter Gay, the concept retains considerable power and integrity. This is implicitly acknowledged in the title of this book, which is after all, The Enlightenment, not Enlightenments. Implicit in Outram's discussions are recurrent themes such as the importance of reason, skepticism towards received authority, the desire to use knowledge to improve the human condition, etc., which are stated by people like Gay to be basic unifying features of the Enlightenment. Outram's discussions add nuance to traditional views but don't contradict them, and in some ways implicitly endorse them. I think Outram overstates the extent to which recent scholarship has qualified views of the Enlightenment. The recent emphasis on greater geographic variation of the Enlightenment is an example. Peter Gay himself made a good deal out of American participation in the Enlightenment and he was hardly the first scholar to do so. Smith, several Americans, and Kant have long been considered important figures of the Enlightenment. Since when have Glasgow, tidewater Virginia, and Konigsberg been part of the heartland of Europe. Outram disparages the emphasis on French intellectuals yet her own text repeatedly cites the experience and writings of Voltaire, Diderot, etc., undercutting her explicit point.While Outram is a careful scholar and writer, she also commits some missteps. Her discussion of Hume's epistemology as part of a critique of 18th century science is somewhat offbase. She presents Hume's views correctly but incompletely. Hume thought of himself as carrying out a Newtonian program of research in human psychology and far from undercutting the validity of scientifically generated knowledge, he placed it in a privileged position. Her discussion of 18th century voyages of exploration and the tendency of European intellectuals to project utopian visions onto Pacific island societies is astute but she overlooks the fact there was probably a significant kernal of truth in reports of the utopian nature of these cultures. Because of their biological isolation, these societies lacked many of the epidemic diseases that plagued the rest of the world. For example, a high percentage of Cook's crew probably had disfiguring smallpox scars, something that would have been unknown in Polynesia prior to contact with Europeans."},{"Title":"The Enlightenment (New Approaches to European History)","review":"Most history books tend to either be too long and in-depth on a topic of interest or too brief. This book is neither, which is especially impressive given that it clocks in under 200 pages and covers, essentially, a century.Outram succeeds in her basic layout of the book and in her lack of \\"kiddie gloves\\" in respect to her audience. She opens the book with a discussion of differing interpretations of the Enlightenment, in particular an essay contest in a Berlin newspaper in 1785. Outram begins with a discussion of Kant's response to the question, \\"What is Enlightenment?\\" Throughout the book, the scholar responds to shortcomings of other historical analyses of the period and explores, in short, 15-page sections, specific questions regarding the Enlightenment. Outram wastes no time diving into the complex morass of the eighteenth century. Writing in clear, lucid prose with a quick style, Outram brings to light new ideas on the Enightenment while responding to more traditional interpretations in due course.The history professor who is directing my seminar on Religious Toleration in Renaissance and Reformation Europe recommended this book. When I become a high school teacher, I'm pretty sure this is a text I will use."},{"Title":"The Enlightenment (New Approaches to European History)","review":"I took a college course on the Enlightenment.

Small's \\"The Cameralists,\\" an interesting, confident 1909 study that can still be read with pleasure and profit one hundred years after publication -- because of that very confidence (as well as the depth of Small's research).

We have no other secular poem about the futile search for meaning in a meaningless world so fine as the Prelude: it is the Paradise Lost of those who search or long for a fleeting significance. What is significant about the poem is not that we believe what Wordsworth claims about the power of nature and the mind, but that he tried so hard to search out some sense of meaning and order- Wordsworth is the first Modernist writer before there was a name for his anxiety. This edition is wonderful in the way that it presents the 1805 and 1850 versions on opposite pages- it also contains the 1799 version- a real tour de force. Read The Prelude, read it carefully and take it too heart- there is no Song of Myself without Wordsworth's humane yet Promethean quest for significance."},{"Title":"The Prelude, 1799, 1805, 1850 (Norton Critical Editions)","review":"It is interesting that Wordsworth should never have published his most impressive poem. Norton calls it the \\"most original long poem since Milton's Paradise Lost,\\" and it certainly deserves to be ranked alongside the master of the English epic. This poem was not published until after Wordsworth's death in 1850, and there are several versions of it (which are included in this book). The 1798-1799 version is very short, but the 1805 is expanded and includes many epic devices which Wordsworth borrowed from Milton and others. The 1850 version is basically a revised 1805 edition. It is not necessary that you read all three versions of the poem to understand its power, but it is useful to have them all at hand like this.The Prelude is an autobiography about Wordsworth's early life. It is full of sublime images of the world through the eyes of a Romantic, and includes some of the most beautiful imagery ever set to verse in English (I believe). Wordsworth's reflections about the evils of ambition and self-absortion, among other things, are also very powerful.This poem has been widely quoted by such Christian authors as CS Lewis, and has been admired by many great English poets. It is truly a masterpiece, an epic poem done in the tradition of English Romanticism. You can get this poem in many compilations, but usually in abridged form. This edition features the poem in its entirety, and in three version. This poem is essential to any study of English Romanticism."},{"Title":"The Prelude, 1799, 1805, 1850 (Norton Critical Editions)","review":"This book articulates a vision of the world and of the emotions it inspires in a cerebral, yet densely imaged poem. Wordsworth did not want the poem published for fears that it was too self-absorbed; adressing earlier reviews that have made this complaint, it is true that the poem is self absorbed in that it presents the vision of the world from an individual perspective...as all poems do. I find Eliot's use of quotations and footnotes drawing on his banks of memory and reading to be far more self-absorbed than this: a poem intended to communicated clearly. It is true that it is personal in that it was written to a friend with devotion and love, but this does not detract from the power of the language, the power of the vision, and the impact of the poem upon the age(s). As for comparing Wordsworth to a modernist, that comparison is difficult to make as the modernists rejected the romantic's formal language and optimism (both present in the prelude, despite moments of recognition of a bleak 'wasted' world)."},{"Title":"The Prelude, 1799, 1805, 1850 (Norton Critical Editions)","review":"Nothing special - needed it for class.Be detailed and specific. What would you have wanted to know before you purchased the product?Not too short and not too long. Aim for between 75 and 300 words."},{"Title":"The Prelude, 1799, 1805, 1850 (Norton Critical Editions)","review":"I used to like the Romantics - but this revealed to me the extent to which they were all immersed in their own selves so much they couldn't see beyond the individual. Wordsworth is long-winded and dull in linguistic terms, but admittedly some of the imagery (boat-stealing episode) is inspired. It is, fundamentally, all about himself though, and traces his own poetic growth which is interesting as a topic, but not the way Wordsworth does it. He throws in a few token pictures of the poor, who he was so concerned about, but these tend to be superficial compared to his own self. Dull, dull, dull, a complete waste of time. If you have to read it for a course, get the york notes or only read the 1799 version"},{"Title":"Clifford Algebras and Their Applications in Mathematical Physics, Vol. 2: Clifford Analysis","review":"In this second volume of the Proceedings of the Ixtapa Conference on Clifford Algebras and Their Applications to Mathematical Physics, the editors have collected papers which reflect the latest developments in Clifford Analysis. It is fair to say that the authors of the contributions are virtually all the important names in the field, and the picture that the volume presents of Clifford Analysis indicates the vitality of the topic. Maybe the most important thing in this volume (what I called the &quot;new face&quot; of Clifford Analysis) is the clear sense that Clifford Analysis is now used as a powerful tool to solve classical problems which the standards tools from the analysis in Euclidean spaces could not solve. This evolution from a discipline concerned with its own (quite interesting) internal problems, to a discipline capable of addressing outstanding issues in geometry and analysis is the product of the work of many of the contributors to these Proceedings. The volume is divided in four sections. The first deals with partial differential equations and boundary value problems. I particularly appreciated the survey work on the study of Beltrami type equations in three dimensions. The second section deals with Singular Integral Operators, the third offers some important Applications to Geometry and Physics, and the volume concludes with a section on Mobius Transformations and Monogenic Functions. I have found the papers of great interest because they not only address important and difficult problems, but also provide the reader with a wide variety of new issues to deal with. The majority of the papers is rather technical, and probably only accessible to the specialist, but a few of them (including the one on Beltrami equations I mentioned before) provide a sense of the state of the art, which is of great help to the analyst or the geometer who wishes to enter this beautiful branch of mathematics."},{"Title":"Cesar Birotteau","review":"This is the fifth Balzac book I have read, and it is the fourth best of all of them. This may be a great compliment to Balzac's writing abilities since he seems to be able to dispense classic after classic.This story, is a simple tale about the rise and fall of a perfumer. Cesar, the perfumer, lives in Paris and is having a fairly good life thanks to the invention of a hand cream. Unfortunately, since he is not a clever business man, Cesar falls into debt when he throws an elegant society ball. The rest of the book deals with his dowfall as Cesar deals with his wife and daughters sadness, a friend who ran off with 100000 francs, sleazy bankers, an angry nut dealer, architect and his future son in law.Cesar Birroteau is a fairly tragic story which will have the ability to move the reader. Those who have read other Balzac works will recognize Gobseck the money letter and also the reference to the Nucignens from La Pere Goriot.This is a great Balzac work with a notable ending. It is not as good as Eugenie Grandet, Ursule Mirouet or La Pere Goriot but is none the less excellent.Some readers may find Balzac's attention to detail exhausting in several places. Especially in one or two chapters dealing with accounting, you may as well skip over them because they are virtually incomprehensible but also unnecessary.Balzac's characters also seem similar if you have read other books. Cesar is similar to Goriot, Cesarine to Ursule Mirouet and Eugenie Grandet, the prodigy son in law (I forget his name) to Charles and Rastignac and finally the evil banker is similar to master criminal Vautrin.Overall excellent. His charcters cry and fall to their knees a lot but that's no surprise if you've read other books of Balzac."},{"Title":"Worms Wiggle [Pop-up book]","review":"This is such a nice, simple book with very clever pop-ups that really work after many readings.

Much of this book read like a list. Every time food was served, and this was often, the entire menu was listed. One well-known name could never be mentioned; there always had to be one of those doggone lists. \\"The Arsenio Hall Show, The Tonight Show, Oprah.\\" Or \\"Jheryl Busby, Quincy Jones, Eddie Murphy, Al B. Sure, Cuba Gooding, Jr., Jam and Lewis, L.A. and Babyface.\\" Or \\"Chanel, Saint Laurent, Chloe, Christian Dior, Hermes, Givenchy.\\"The name dropping got old real fast. Every time luggage or a wallet was mentioned it was preceded by the words \\"Louis Vuitton.\\" (I think this designer is one of the author's personal favorites; a trivia game could be established counting the number of times she mentions it.) Ms. Copeland obviously was hoping her readers would drool over the descriptions of Italian furniture, Chinese rugs, pink marbled bathrooms, ad nauseam, or else she believes her readers are as shallow as Gunther and Topaz. Lines like \\"They pulled up in front of a four-bedroom house,\\" or \\"Don't you think it's time we started getting ready for the Natalie Cole concert at the Bowl?\\" are showing off merely for the reader's benefit. It is impossible for someone to drive up to a house and know how many bedrooms it has. And anyone who was asking their spouse to get ready would simply say, \\"for the concert,\\" because the spouse would already know who is performing and where. I haven't seen anything so blatant since the Huxtable family had that Princeton fixation (it was never \\"school,\\" always \\"Princeton.\\")The writing is extremely amateurish. There is nothing creative about not using, \\"he/she said.\\" But no one \\"said\\" anything in this book. They barked, yelled, repeated, suggested, sang softly (?!), commented, joined in, protested, scolded, replied, questioned, asked, shouted, squealed, mumbled, admonished, heard voices proclaim (?!), laughed, giggled, promised, offered, commanded, rattled off...but never SAID.Cliches were rampant, another mark of the amateur. Pleased as Punch, cool as ice, like a kid in a candy store, sugary sweet. How did this get published?The point of view bounced back and forth like a tennis ball. Dialogue was usually accompanied with empty descriptions of emotions, i.e. \\"She couldn't believe it.\\" \\"She was sincere.\\" \\"She was livid.\\" If Ms. Copeland knew anything about writing she would know that the first rule of writing is show, don't tell! But yet every time a character was introduced their complexion was described, even people who were just passing through, like customer service clerks. What's up with that?The use of \\"Dang\\" REALLY got on my nerves. In the end I found myself skipping through the endless lists and empty emotions just to see Gunther and Topaz get their comeuppance.But, hey, considering all the readers who thought this book was fabulous, maybe I'm just being too picky to expect good writing."},{"Title":"Chocolate Star","review":"I've had Chocolate Star since it was first released but never got around to reading it until now...and gosh was I pleasantly surprised. Ms. Copeland's debut novel was very well written with in-depth characters and a plausible storyline. Once I started reading Chocolate Star it was definitely a page-turner and a book that was hard to put down. Ms. Copeland took us into the lives of four rags to riches characters whose lives were all intertwined as the result of Topaz the female character. Topaz...what a character! This chile' worked it and could have any man she wanted and definitely was an attraction for Germaine, Sean, and Gunther. Each of these men would either break her heart, steal her heart or never leave her heart. Chocolate Star allowed one to escape into the world of the rich and famous...albeit while money provided access to gourmet foods, travel to exotic locations, all the drugs you wanted when you wanted them and shopping, shopping, shopping, shopping and more ...it definitely didn't provide happiness. Each chapter was devoted to a different character and I liked reading the in-depth characteristics of each individual. I felt like a fly on the wall eavesdropping on the lives of some of Hollywood's greatest stars. Okay...you knew some \\"buts\\" were coming.... My biggest pet peeve with the book was the constant reference to skin color. Why did EVERY character have to be described in detail according to their skin color (mocha brown; deep, deep chocolate; vanilla almond)? After awhile it became a big nuisance. I can imagine what people look like I don't necessarily have to know what shade of black they are since we all come in so many color variations anyway. Additionally the inference that you couldn't be a star unless you were into drugs was annoying as well as the frequent mention of brand names. Also, I couldn't believe that once Topaz became a big star that the tabloids/media never discovered her secret past. This alone is unbelievable in today's world. Fortunately, the pet peeves were neutralized a little by accepting that Chocolate Star was a portrayal of life in Hollywood where folks aren't always real and tend to be a little superficial. Aside from the \\"stuff that was unbelievable or that I could live without\\" the book was good and held my interest to the very end. If you're looking to escape with a book this summer then check out this one...I believe you will be pleasantly surprised. I know I was."},{"Title":"Chocolate Star","review":"A friend of mine bought the book to me and told me &quot;girl this book is the bomb&quot;, page after page I found myself craving for more chocolate. Each character was given a teaspoon of life and I must admit I am totally impressed with Sheila Copeland's wonderful style of writing. I loved Sean Ross and respected his stand on &quot;no sex before marraige&quot;, he had a beautiful relationship with God and his parents. No matter how many woman threw themselves at his feet he was able to go to his mother and find out how he could determine real love from love because of success. Topaz, being a beautiful sista with talent did not appreciate the only people that would ever love her, how can you give up a marraige and a child in a finger snap and not feel guilty about it when you lay your head down to sleep at night, most women crave a good man to come along, she only wanted the fame. And last but not least Gunther, he was a straight trip-he did not appreciate where he came from only cared when he got to the top and looked down on people. I was surprised that he and Topaz were married at all. Thank goodness Sean did not fall into her &quot;things to do list&quot;. I will definitly buy part 2 and enjoy the pages that make me want to read it over and over. This book is a must, pick it up you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Chocolate Star","review":"I wanted to read Chocolate Star based on some reviews given by Sherry Carter of BET and Brenda Ritchie. I was not disappointed because Chocoalate Star had all the ingredients of a great novel. The characters were really out of this world, a little larger than life - soap opera like - but still very intriguing. The main characters, basketball player Sylk Ross and Topaz the singer were my favorites. Sylk seems like a dream guy - he is successful, loves his family and friends, and remembers to give praise and thanks to the Lord for his blessings. Topaz is self-centered and demeaning at times but I think she learns valuable lessons in the end. That movie producer Gunther is a hard person to like. He is arrogant, forget that he is Black, and is just simply unbelievable at times. If there are any sour points in Chocolate Star it would have to be the overemphasis on designer names, but then again maybe that is someone else's reality. The book was truly a page turner and I believe other readers will find Chocolate Star an enjoyable read as well."},{"Title":"Chocolate Star","review":"I must say that I read Chocolate Affair before I read Chocolate Star, as I was unaware that Chocolate Affair was a sequel.

It was well organized, had great plots, and plenty of twists and turns to keep the reader interested. Although this was a work of fiction, I felt as if it could've been a true story and since Ms. Copeland is the founder of a production company, I haven't any doubt that these characters are based on some real-life people. I advise anyone thinking of picking up this book to go ahead and get it. YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED! Ms. Copeland touches on issues such as selfishness, greed, abandoning one's roots, faith, integrity and true love. Her literary piece is well woven and I applaud her creative effort. Chocolate Star is truly deserving of five stars!"},{"Title":"Chocolate Star","review":"I read this book for the first time a few years ago, and I found it to be very entertaining Intriguing characters, good storylines, and a fairly quick read for its size. Recently, I purchased \\"Diamond Revelation\\", and I needed to refresh my memory of the characters, so I revisited \\"Chocolate Star\\". The second time around for me was even better. The first time, like I said, it was just light fun reading. The second time I read it, it held more meaning. Perhaps I needed time to grow to appreciate the trials of the characters. Topaz was definitely over the top, but Ms. Copeland gave her just enough realness to keep it interesting. I loved the development of Gunther; a brilliant mind and amazing talent mixed with a huge ego and self hatred. That almost always is a recipe for disaster. Sean provided good balance, to me. While everything was so \\"Hollywood\\" and glitzy, Sean, although famous and extremely wealthy, remained a very grounded person. Use of description for the atmosphere was outstanding. I had a bit of a problem in the beginning with the POV switching from third person back to first person, but after a chapter or two, that all fell in line, and I didn't even notice. A good story needs good characters, and Ms. Copeland definitely provided those. You'll have a love/hate relationship with Topaz. You'll find yourself rooting for her, then when she does something so completely selfish and stupid, you just want to see her get hers. With Gunther, you're pretty much waiting for him to crash and burn. Even almost perfect Sean has his issues; falling for Topaz and becoming addicted to painkillers. You'll find yourself hoping that his faith pulls him through. What I love about this book is that it is gripping, yet there are so many subtle and valuable lessons.

I feel that this story of three different Blacks and their rise to fame can be a lesson to many, if not all, African- Americans, as well as other nationalities."},{"Title":"Chocolate Star","review":"I really enjoyed this book, but if left me hanging. I hope that there will be a finish to Topaz's story, her part of the book did'nt end as far as I'm concerned she needs a closing. Other then that it was a excellent book."},{"Title":"Chocolate Star","review":"Chocolate Star was an exciting, well-written book by the young talented artist, Sheila Copeland. It gave you a visual image of what happens when you become successful and how your morals and entire life changes. The book gave a clear example of how money changes people. The struggles, tragedies, and accomplishment displayed throughout the book gave you a realistic view of the glamour and glitter attached to Hollywood."},{"Title":"Chocolate Star","review":"This was one of the first books that I read when I first got into reading last year. I read like 3-4 books a month. This book opened me up to black fiction books. This book was tight for real. I would recommend it to everyone."},{"Title":"Chocolate Star","review":"Chocolate Star was a good and very interesting book. I liked it because it was a very open book and it talked about thongs that happen today in our society. It was funny and very well organized. The Characters I didn't like was Gunther and Topaz because Gunther didn't like his own race, which was African American and Topaz thought she was better than everyone else. I only liked Sean because he reached for his goals no matter what and that's how I like it. I really enjoyed this book and I reccommend this book to everyone who like a lot of drama."},{"Title":"Chocolate Star","review":"I liked this book it's not one of my favorites but it kept me reading it everyday to see what was going to happen. I didn't like Topez. Was she serious? I really HATED Gunther! He made it seem like he hated black people, and he was black. If you want to know what I'm talking about read it."},{"Title":"Chocolate Star","review":"This book should be a TV movie. It would be great, I can just picture it now. The book told of three African Americans trying to make it big. Which at one point they all did. But, one of them kept it real and that was Sean Ross. I like his character alot. And happy for him, at the end. On the other hand there's Gunther who thinks he is white, and forgets where he is from.He also thinks he is the man. He is married to Topaz who leaves her husband and baby at 6 months old. What kind of mother is that? I think all of the characters were created great and were all different and clear to understand. At first I didn't think I would like it. But, Ms. Copeland proved me wrong."},{"Title":"Chocolate Star","review":"The book was fun and not boring. I enjoyed the colorful, and I use that term loosely, characters. It was a bit pretentious at times which took a lot away from it. Sean's character is to be admired, but his referring to his mother and father as &quot;Mommy&quot; and &quot;Daddy&quot; was a bit out there. I do not need to know every single piece of food on each plate each time. I do not need to learn a person's complexion before I learn anything about that person. Brand names mentioned repetetively do not hold my attention. Louis Vuitton and Chanel were thrown around far more times than I wish to count. Although all these played a major factor in my rating of this book, I did enjoy it. Overall, Chocolate Star was a good read. Only the author's writing technique left a lot to be desired."},{"Title":"Chocolate Star","review":"If you have a sweet tooth, this is the book for you. This is all the chocolate you need in one helping. The men are good looking and the women go all out. Sheila Copeland pulled out all the stops for this one. You got the big head, the spoiled and the ignorant. I really recommend buying this book and the sequel &quot;A Chocolate Affair&quot;. All I can say is, bring your dinner to bed with you."},{"Title":"Chocolate Star","review":"This was a book that was just not writen for me. I did not care for the casual drug usage.Why did Topaz have to throw the phone everytime she hangs up.Anyway this is a book that took me back, her mentioning Arsenio Hall show (HA HA) made me feel old.It just is not a story for the New Millennium.I'm going to give A Chocolate Affair a try."},{"Title":"Chocolate Star","review":"This story was a pretty good read if you like the glitz-glamour scene of the young elite; however, it was a bit long. I thought Copeland did pretty well with creating this story without harsh profanity, but a little cussing would've given the drama a bit more punch!"},{"Title":"Chocolate Star","review":"I think that this book was very good. Kesiha and Eric are the lovalbe couple."},{"Title":"Chocolate Star","review":"I have and always will recommend this one many times over. It was excellent! It was in no ways boring and kept me wondering what the characters were going to do next. I finished it wondering what ever happens to the characters next and here comes &quot;Chocolate Affair&quot; containing the same characters and more issues. I am not yet finished with it but am now wondering when the next one is coming out. Great Job Sheila Copeland!!"},{"Title":"Chocolate Star","review":"This book was better than I thought it would be. The story will keep you engrossed and it is good from start to finish. Sheila Copeland made a great debut with this and I would recommend this book to anyone who wants a novel that is a page turner. It makes you anxious to read Chocolate Affair immediately because the characters are so colorful and real. The only problem was the main character calling his parents &quot;Mommy&quot; and &quot;Daddy&quot;, what was up with that? Also all the name dropping of designer this and that but it kind of has to be there to show the superficial quality in some of the characters. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Chocolate Star","review":"Chocolate Star was a good book overall. I liked how each chapter focused on one of the three main characters. I really liked Sylk Ross, but I hated how he referred to his parents. I mean come on, how many grown men call their parents &quot;Mommy and Daddy&quot;. And I got so tired of Gunther and his use of &quot;Dang&quot;. I found that the author was unable to create her male characters with a realistic male perspective. Other than that I found Chocolate Star to be pretty interesting."},{"Title":"Chocolate Star","review":"I was turned on to the book by one of my daughters who read the book overnight. She told me how good it was and I had the sheer pleasure of reading it also. I found the book very exciting, interesting and inspirational. After reading the Prelude of the book I couldn't wait to see the who, what and why of it all. The storyline kept my attention the entire time. The characters excelled in drawing my attention, concern, anger, rage, and compassion. Although I loved all of the glamour and glitz, and how the storyline expressed how it sometimes leads to a false sense of happiness: I appreciated how the author incompassed reality and the importance of fulfilling the needs of the human heart and soul. I hope the author continues to write, because I would definately read her next book."},{"Title":"Chocolate Star","review":"THE PLOT, CHARACTERS AND WRITING STYLE WAS SO JUVENILE THAT IT WAS AWFUL. I WAS NOT AMUSED WITH MS.COPELAND'S JUMPING FROM THIRD PERSON TO FIRST PERSON, SOMETIMES IN THE SAME PARAGRAPH. THE CHARACTERS WERE SO TYPICAL THAT YOU PRETTY MUCH KNEW WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN FROM JUST READING THE FIRST CHAPTER.THE BOOK WAS SO TERRIBLE THAT IT WAS AN INSULT TO MY INTELLIGENCE. IT AMAZES ME THAT THIS BOOK WAS EVEN PUBLISHED.MS. COPELAND NEEDS TO DEVELOP HER TALENT !!!!!"},{"Title":"Chocolate Star","review":"Drivel!!!! And that's all I have to say about that."},{"Title":"Chocolate Star","review":"This is an excellent book. I particularly enjoyed Ms. Copeland's style of writing. The characters were great, especially &quot;Gunther&quot; , a really great &quot;dude&quot;. His frankness and square mannerism kept me laughing. It really displays what can happen to people when they get a little money. Fame and fortune went to their head. It will make you laugh, scream in anger, and maybe want to cry (If you are a softy). I strongly recommend this book to others."},{"Title":"Chocolate Star","review":"i really love sheila copelands work and i cant wait until she drops another one. This book is really good.

Better than I expected and the character of Topaz--not enough fame and fortune can make you happy."},{"Title":"Chocolate Star","review":"I can't believe this was her first book.I loved all of the characters!!It made me cry and laugh.I read it 5 times already.I definitely recommend this book to everyone."},{"Title":"Chocolate Star","review":"ok this is the foremost exciting novel i had read. the characters was all wonderful but i personal dislike gunther. he was my worst identity crisis brotha i have ever met and to think we have many gunthers out there...as the saying goes what goes up must come down and a lot of money is very evil...never turn your back on your family no matter how they treat you...he could had done a lot for them and teach them a thing of two but with his attitude who want him too *S* and topaz...honey you are a great actress..and sadly to say we do have a lot of you out there...and i give my hats off to sean 'syllk' ross. i really enjoy reading his character because he realize his mistake when fame and popularity had brought him...when he had gotten injured he realized that he was on a very high horse and end up being single and lonely but God has His reason and i really enjoyed reading the changes in him and especially with all the temptations of evil knocking at his door...he stood up against it and had end up becoming the best man after all *S* a great book to read about morals and what fame and money can do to you *S*cant wait to read another sheila copeland's book. *S*"},{"Title":"Chocolate Star","review":"I really loved this book especially the character Sean Ross, you don't meet many men in this world today like the author betrayed this character.

There are so many unanswered questions about Topaz and her first hushand and child. Overall I really enjoyed this book."},{"Title":"Chocolate Star","review":"I thought this was an excellent book....It really kept me interest in every character. I also loved how all the characters were connected in some way or another. Ms.Copeland has herself a new fan. And, I am looking forward to her next novle."},{"Title":"Chocolate Star","review":"I like how Ms. Copeland wrote such a clean book with no profanity or any raunchy sex scenes. I liked how she made the character Sean a Christian and how he stayed with his religious belief to remain a virgin until he married. And there was another thing about the story that I liked that the author made realistic: Like when Topaz ran off and left her husband and child to start a singing career. And she would always put her singing career first before her family. Then she started sleeping around with other men when she already had a husband who really loved and cared about her. But she took advantage of him. And then at the end of the story she ended up with nobody. Good book Ms. Copeland."},{"Title":"Chocolate Star","review":"I don't ever remember reading a book where the characters stayed with me long after I completed the book. I found myself still praying for Topaz, Gunther, and Sean for weeks after I read the last page. Perhaps some of the story is predictable, but I found myself rooting for them nonetheless. This book definately makes for a great reading experience."},{"Title":"Chocolate Star","review":"This is simply the best book I've ever read! I enjoyed the intricate detail she used to create a visual. You really felt you knew the characters. The story was realistic and ventured into the lives of African Americans. Great book, great details, and it was a great story. She is truly brilliant!"},{"Title":"Chocolate Star","review":"I enjoyed reading this book. Yet the book left me hanging as far as Topaz. I hope there will be a sequel to this book where Topaz finds her way to true love. I would also love to read more about Sean and his loving family and friends. I will continue to look for your next book(Part II)."},{"Title":"Chocolate Star","review":"Fast reading book and very exciting. Interesting to read how the rich and famous prioritize the issues in their lives. I'm hoping that there will be a follow-on book to CHOCOLATE STAR. I really want to know which man Topaz will run to. What will her children grow up to be? Will Sean and Jade live happily ever after? Many ideas can be made from this book."},{"Title":"Chocolate Star","review":"I found the over description of skin tone and hair texture a bit pretentious. It is so obvious that the author favors the blacks of a lighter hue with white features. When the characters encountered blacks that were darker, they seemed AMAZED that these darker brothers and sisters could also be attractive. Other darker blacks were portrayed as sloppy, unkept, and unrefined. Secondly, I find it hard to believe a grown man in the NBA would call his parents, &quot;Mommy&quot; and &quot;Daddy&quot;! Even before Sean made it in the NBA he referred to his parents by these infantile monikers. This was comical to the point of out and out laughter. If for no other reason, the saga of these three would-be stars could at least teach the reader how NOT to treat people!"},{"Title":"Chocolate Star","review":"I absoulutely loved Chocolate Star, from the time I read the first page until the very last paragraph. This book has many of loops and turns that keeps the reader well into it until the very last page. The characters are so realistic that you feel as though you have met someone like that before. I recommend this book to all of my friends."},{"Title":"Chocolate Star","review":"All the members of the African American Literature Society enjoyed this book. It is exciting and definately a page turner. It grapsed our attention from the very first chapter. We were all surprised at the outcome of the characters lives. There was no clue how things would change so drastically until close to the end. We all hated that it had to end. The author is to be commended! We look forward to her next work."},{"Title":"Chocolate Star","review":"I think this book was great!!

I look forward to more works by Sheila Copeland!"},{"Title":"Chocolate Star","review":"I loved this book. It was very hard to put it down to do other things. Ms. Copeland should definetly write more books to add to this to this saga. I love following the charaters as their lives unfolds. There was not 1 boring part. I'm looking forward to the next one. Great work!"},{"Title":"Chocolate Star","review":"This was a very interesting book. I enjoyed reading about Sean because of his strong Christian beliefs. I thought Gunther was finally turning his life around and was going to start his relationship back with his family. It is a shame his life ended the way it did. Topaz was a very self centered individual who seem to care only about herself and not her children. I hope there is a sequel to this book about Topaz. Overall, I really enjoyed your book. Keep using the gift God gave you!!"},{"Title":"Chocolate Star","review":"Chocolate Star is a very entertaining novel. I really enjoyed reading this book and I think it is a pretty good first novel for Copeland. We have all had to deal with a &quot;Topaz&quot; at some time or another and I've worked with a &quot;Gunther&quot; before and every sister out there is looking for a Mr.&quot;Sylk&quot;! I've been told not judge a book by it's cover which is definitely the case with this book. I left it on my dresser for two weeks before I picked it up and once I did, I couldn't put it down. I read this book in two days and wanted more after I was done!"},{"Title":"Chocolate Star","review":"I read this book when it frist came out many years ago. Topaz is a spoiled, selfish woman who will stop at nothing to get what she wants. i love that she's driven to succeed and not depending on a man to give her what anything.Gunther loses his mind with his comeuppance. He writes off his family and showers Topaz with the world until his drug habit gets out of control and eventually destroys him.Germaine is too good a man for Topaz but he can't help who he loves and even though Topaz left him and their son to pursue her dreams he still want to be with her. Topaz is in and out of Germaine's and their son's life and Germaine has had enough or has he?When i finished the book i was excited to learn there would be a sequel. I love Topaz and all her antics. hopefully she'll stop searching for what she already has and settle down in her career and with Germaine.Great work Shelia keep em coming!"},{"Title":"Chocolate Star","review":"Good book.

Along the way she makes friends and enemies - which is the foundation for this book. Ms. Topas and her escapades are DRAMA, DRAMA and more DRAMA.Kudos to the author for a debut novel that DOES NOT DISAPPOINT.If you're leary about this book - take my word for it. I read this book more than 5 years ago and 5 years later is still leaves an indelible mark.

Her relationship with her husband and best friend are in jeopardy as she gets caught up in all the glitz and glamour of superstardom. Topaz learns that with all the fame and fortune, it can still be lonely at the top. You will be thoroughly entertained with this novel.

I enjoyed the interaction of the three rising stars, as well as each of their individual journeys.Sylk Ross is the kind of man, many of us dream of.Topaz is the kind of woman, many of wish we could be.And Gunther is the kind of man many of us fear.This is an excellent read."},{"Title":"Chocolate Star","review":"This book was very enjoyable and entertaining but Sheila Copeland disgusts me with her love of perfection and her overly obsessed mentions of &quot;her&quot; favorite colour. If you can't take this book...don't even begin to read Chocolate Affair. Sheila also tends to make her characters too perfect and almost unrealistic with little flaws if any at all."},{"Title":"Chocolate Star","review":"I was hooked on this booked from the first page. Sheila is dynamic, I'm truly a fan for life. I can't wait to read chocalate affair. Buy this book you won't be dissapointed."},{"Title":"Chocolate Star","review":"This was one of the first books that I read when I first got into reading last year. I read like 3-4 books a month. This book opened me up to black fiction books. This book was tight for real. I would recommend it to everyone."},{"Title":"Chocolate Star","review":"The thing I liked the most about this book is Sean Ross. It is about time that a character with Chrisitian values is presented in a book. I hope more characters such as Sean Ross appear in more books, TV and movies. He struggled with his beliefs, but he still held on to his faith. The other two characters tried to base their happiness on material things only and they were not happy in the end.I hope Ms. Copeland continues the story of Topaz."},{"Title":"Chocolate Star","review":"I enjoyed the book, it was very good. The begining was a little slow, but the charactors tied in together real well. I'm sure Sheila Copeland's next book will be twice as good."},{"Title":"Chocolate Star","review":"I really liked this book and it's characters. I thought they were very diverse and interesting. I wanted to know more about the characters at the end and stayed up until three in the morning to finish it. I don't think it was overwritten and references to the importance of christian values and principles is very original. I have not read a book quite like it before and am very impressed. More books like this one please!"},{"Title":"Chocolate Star","review":"I must admit after hearing from a friend (an avid reader)about this book I was dying to read it. In my opinion the book was very entertaining,funny and passionate. It was great to read a book about African-Americans becoming part of the elite group of the super rich and famous. Whether or not Ms.Copeland's writing skills are in need of &quot;help&quot; that's are own individual opinion. This book to me was just for entertainment value (like all books). There's a Topaz Black,Sean Ross and Gunther Lawrence in every town. In fact I know some of them. There was one, make that two things that were very distrubing to me in the book. The fact that Topaz left a great husband, father and provider for her own personal gain. Let's face it we all have dreams but when a child is involved our dreams may have to be put on hold (not given up) for the sake of the innocent. The other thing was Gunther's pre-conceived notion that high status = adapting to a &quot;white&quot; lifestyle . I don't rememeber it word for word but he said something to the effect that now I have the car all I need is a &quot;blond&quot; sitting next to me with the top down. How about now all I need is a great woman who loves me for me by my side. Even though most of the reviews I've read were mixed, I would love to see this book as a made for TV movie or even on the big screen. Congratulations Shelia."},{"Title":"Chocolate Star","review":"This book will touch the hearts of young and old as they realize there's more to fame than just fortune. After reading this book I realized that being Afro-American and famous doesn't make you a Chocolate Star, It starts in the heart of the person."},{"Title":"Chocolate Star","review":"I read this book and could not put it down. I laughed out loud. I cried. I got angry. I believe I went through all the emotions. If they ever make a movie (I hope they do), I think Mariah Carey should play Topaz. Morris Chestnut should play Gunther. I can't think of who should play Sylk Ross. The book was really good. It is one of my favorite books right now."},{"Title":"Chocolate Star","review":"CHOCOLATE STAR was a really good read. It tells the story of three enterprising young African Americans from different backgrounds, with varying degrees of morality and values, all totally dedicated to being successful in their chosen career fields. This book outlines the paths they chose to reach their personal goals. It shows how their lives became intertwined as adults. CHOCOLATE STAR finds the reader cheering and booing their antics, as they forge ahead. This is a very satisfying book, with realistic twists and turns, and with the perfect, yet unanticipated ending. The only negative about the book was the tawdry cover. I wouldn't have bought this book off the shelf (it was a book club requirement) because the cover looked like it represented a sleazy story. The cover could have been much more relative and appealing."},{"Title":"Chocolate Star","review":"I usually do not write book reviews but I felt compelled to write this one. I thought Chocolate Star was excellent. The characters were well-developed, realistic because they had problems and the writer is extremely talented. I can hardly wait to read something else by her and have suggested this book to anybody who will listen."},{"Title":"Chocolate Star","review":"I read as many as 200 books/year and enjoy most writing styles, genres and content. However I must say that I was most disappointed and even insulted by the very elementary, juvenile and obviously topical novel written by Ms. Copeland, who was touted as the black 'Jackie Collins'. Ms. Copeland is not even in the same literary galaxy. I'm amazed that her novels are sold in the same bookstore as Ms. Collins'. All of the characters and plots were obvious and predictable; Everything (and I mean everything) was overtly overstated, underscored and highlighted, leaving nothing the imagination or intellect of the reader. As a voracious reader, a consumer, an American and a female, I do not need to be told that 'Waterford' is the world cut crystal standard, or that a pricey collection of perfumes would necessarily include Joy or Escada. It's enough to say that 'Topaz served champagne in her finest Irish crystal'. C'mon Ms. Copeland, where are your writing skills? Additionally, she failed to mature the characters commensurate with their achievements and situations. For example, their quality and depth of their dialogue (most notably it was limited to the use of a quasi-fictional universal 'black' slang) and vocabulary were static (i.e. 'Word.'), as were the dynamics of their primary relationships. This is not realistic for young adults over a ten year span of time. Lastly, Ms. Copeland did not thoroughly research her settings. Anyone who went to school in or lives near Philadelphia knows that the University of Pennsylvania is affectionately known as 'Penn', not 'U Penn'. Mid-Atlantic residents are likely to consider U Penn as Pennsylvania State University, which is known respectively as 'Penn State'. Similar errors were made in reference to settings in NYC, LA and Atlanta. If this book is representative of the up and coming crop of African-American contemporary fictional writers, heaven help us all!!"},{"Title":"Chocolate Star","review":"I read this book after reading the second one and I was still very impressed with her style of writing and the people in her book.

Mrs. Berton gives an insight to the Goldrush town of Dawson City. I can say that you will still find the house she lived in and some of the houses that she describes in her book. As a resident of Dawson City it is nice to have read a book that is truly about what life was and is in Dawson City."},{"Title":"I Married the Klondike","review":"Ms. Berton's account of life in Dawson from 1907 to the 1920's is too late to tell the story of the Klondike gold rush. Instead it tells of life in a small northern community that has seen its hey-day come and go, describing it's traditions and lifestyle in such detail you soon feel as though you've lived there too.The descriptive passages are excellent and the book contains several colorful tales of individual struggles, her own and others'. I was a bit put off by the enormous number of names of people she met in the Yukon but didn't find I needed to remember them all to enjoy the book. If you have read the history of Dawson during the gold rush in other books, this is a great afterword that describes many notable figures' lives following the rush, answering several 'whatever happened to so-and-so' questions.I remember our elementary school library encouraging children to read it, but given its richness of detail and adult perspective it's anything but a kid's book. Despite her matter-of-fact writing style, Ms. Berton's story is emotionally engaging and a great portrait of life in northern Canada."},{"Title":"I Married the Klondike","review":"This is the true story of a woman who moved to the Yukon in the days of the Gold Rush - she went to be a schoolteacher for a couple of years, married a prospector, and wound up raising a family in one of the most spectacular - and harshest - places and times in North America. Laura Berton writes with humor and insight, and has produced a most entertaining book which is interesting as biography, as history, and as just a fun read! Laura also produced one of the most prolific authors in Canada today - Pierre Berton, author of FLAMES ACROSS THE BORDER and THE DIONNE YEARS. This is a book that deserves to be more widely read!"},{"Title":"I Married the Klondike","review":"Like most people my age, I've seen old movies depicting the Gold Rush, but they were nothing compared to this delightful account of the author's experiences in Dawson and Whitehorse, in the Yukon. From page one to the end, I FELT the cold of the North, learned about the vegetation and moreso, shared in the life of the pioneers AFTER the Gold Rush. Such hearty men and women gave of themselves in the search for gold, few, very feew becoming rich. Yet, they all seem to have enrichened my life thanks to their determination and stamina despite all odds. To read of the social differences that the citizens upheld in Dawson gives one a thoughtful look at the upper classes, who brought their prejudices with them to Dawson. Yet, with time, as the gold became more and more rare, the population dwindled and with it the many differences, which had segretated the classes. Abandoned homes, run-down shacks, empty stores finally gave way to social values, which brought the remaining residents together. As the author mentions, one could not walk down the street of Dawson without saying \\"hello\\" to everyone since the life of one touched the life of the others. With only 800 persons left in town, all knew one another and social standing gave way to familial attitudes. It was no longer necessary to give the telephone operator a number, only the name of the person to whom one wanted to speak need be mentioned and the phone rang at the other end. Tragedy and hardships took hold of the life of everyone, but friendship and helpfulness prevailed as their numbers dwindled. A beautiful read, which has opened my mind and heart to these pioneers, who are our ancestors."},{"Title":"I Married the Klondike","review":"What a fascinating look at life in the north. This book shattered my assumptions about life in this part of the world. The author gave a very realistic view of the highlights of life in a very harsh environment as well as the day-to-day challenges and pleasures of such a life. The colorful descriptions provide a very realistic picture without becoming cumberson.This book also helped me look differently at the pleasures and challenges in my own life. Great read!"},{"Title":"I Married the Klondike","review":"I wanted to learn more about Yukon history after readingThe Floor of Heaven: A True Tale of the Last Frontier and the Yukon Gold Rushby Howard Blum. This is an excellent follow-up from an unusual source, the female perspective. Women were few and far between in Yukon history. Laura Beatrice Berton provides rich geographical and social details what life was like from 1907 until about 1932. Unlike many embellished Yukon tales, I believe Mrs. Berton's story to be entirely true. She didn't mince words, often using humor to describe bleak situations or colorful characters. While this book could and should be read by both sexes, male readers might get bogged down with chapters centering around Dawson City's social events and prominent citizens. Mrs. Berton seemed very proud of her social status within the community. I found the constant name-dropping and social mores a bit tedious, even though her notes are an important historical contribution. Surprisingly, she never mentions the names of her two children, and includes few of their family activities.

Make no mistake, Berton's book is very honest about life in Dawson City over 100 years ago. Men literally froze to death and shifty miner-types frightened single women. Illnesses ravaged the town population at times and in the end it was a tough economy \\"on the Outside\\" that finally forced the Berton family to leave Dawson City for good.Although this book is considered a Canadian classic, I must confess I had never even heard of this book until my Alaska-traveling parents brought it back to me as a gift. While I might not have been able to see the Yukon for myself, this gem of a book was just the thing to carry my imagination to another time and place. A time and place I thought I might want to visit, but now I'm happy to be living with all the modern conveniences in my life right now."},{"Title":"I Married the Klondike","review":"I read this book during a travel threw canada in 1985 especially Atlin in the yukon.

Most power these days is used by spiritually weak and insecure people to manipulate and control others. The author encourages us to find the power within, which is a sense and knowledge of our own worth and that of others about us and use this to defuse the anger and lack of communication that so often leads to conflict and - in worst case scenarios - loss of life. She uses these philosophies to highlight the worst facets of humanity and though there are some curious flights of fantasy (including one concerning a group of priestesses and their lusty admirers that will have you squirming in your seat in embarrassment for the author) these are more or less balanced out by the overall common sense and enthusiasm of the rest of the work. Mixing self-help with social history and gender concerns this book leads the reader to discover real power that helps, not harms, others and as such it is a worthy read if, perhaps, not the best book I have read on this subject. Buy it, I don't think you'll be disappointed."},{"Title":"Bible History: Containing the Most Remarkable Events of the Old and the New Testament","review":"This book was on the shelf in our house, I remember clearly from childhood, many decades ago.

It contributes to the false notion that a Eurocentric physical appearance is an indicatior of African American beauty. The photograph on the front cover of the book is a fine example of this. All of the young women in the photograph have long straightened/chemically altered hair and their skin complexions range from light to medium brown. None of these young sisters are dark skinned nor do they sport natural and/or short hair styles! In addition this book contributes to the socializing of girls into beingself-consumed with beauty. A young woman's self esteem should be based on her character, her talents and her accomplishments NOT on her appearance. They must know they are special because they are respected and valued. Tips on beauty from the \\"Hollywood stars\\" and beauty tips on how to prepare for a \\"date\\" are shallow issues that do not build self-esteem, strong principals or values. Lets not insult the intelligence of our teen daughters by believing that their world ONLY consits of beauty and dates. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS BOOK! More appropriate books for young African American womens'beauty should be centered around self-love and self-acceptance. Natural beauty books that truly embrace self-love/acceptance and Afrocentricity are \\"No Lye\\" by Tulani Kinard and \\"Lets Talk Hair\\" by Pamela Ferrell. Start your daughters off with these two books. It is in these kinds of books that the \\"beauty\\" issues around self-esteem that plague so many African American women and teens today are discussed. It is also in these books that various photos of African American females of many complexions,and hair textures/lenghts and ages are shown."},{"Title":"Born Beautiful: The African American Teenager's Complete Beauty Guide","review":"I bought this book when I was a teenager and found it helpful.

Not only does this book offer numerous arguements on why the God of the Bible is the truth, it offers logical arguements on why the God of the bible is the truth! I highly recommend this book to anyone who is agnostic or still searching for hard facts in a world full of confusing theologies. This book is also recommended for those who confess their Christian faith but often have troubles in apologetics and explaining why they believe in the God of the Bible. This is a must for every thinking persons bookshelf beucase it goes straight to the heart of hard to answer questions. I enjoyed the book mainly because it answered most of my questions with lavished accuracy and spared room for personal judgement on why or why not to accept the given arguements."},{"Title":"Christianity: The Faith that Makes Sense","review":"This book makes a logical and reasonable case for the truth of Christ, the Bible, and the historic orthodox Christian faith.

It seems strange that people, living lives on this planet, come to advanced ages without realizing the make up of the human form and the connection with the harmony of the Universe. If a person were to use this book as it is designed, as a workbook and course of self development, one would recognize it as a proven chart for the return of one's true esteem. It is designed as a book to be written in, colored, written about, and practiced, until one rediscovers the Universal Connection.In going through the materials in this book, one may come to many things that were left out of his/her education from parental guidance, public schools, and University: ways of perceiving self as a part of a very wise Universe, and fully able to connect with that wisdom and perfection. The main premise appears to be that the whole of the Universe, and all that is in it, is composed of Energy, and all energy follows the same Universal Laws. We, as resonant and radiant beings, can enhance and enrich our own lives by returning to the more child-like states of connection to that Universal Design. &quot;All of the body is in the Mind, but not all of the Mind is in the body.&quot; Captain Jutta offers us this wisdom, but he goes further in providing study and practice to make the understanding of this basic concept one that will alter our transformation in ways that will lead to more esteem and comfort in our own Remarkable Journey.The actual tools provided in the chapters on exercises, such as breathing and eye movements, offer potentials for personal practice for transformations in one's relationships with self and others.If nothing else in the book were important to our understanding of self, the two eye movements in chapters eight and nine, are critical to helping an individual lessen life traumas and misperceptions which often lead one to a lack of true self worth, as well as provide a technique for raising one's own energy amplitude. When Captain Jutta tells us that lower energy cannot afflict higher energy, he is spelling out the method for our own enhancement and feelings of worthiness and self empowerment. Through our own self empowerment we than are capable of empowering others in our lives.When the breathing exercises are done consistently and with an eye on perfection, one can become more enhanced in health and well-being. Through continued practice and journaling, one can become familiar with how utilization of all the brain waves can lead to increased knowing, creativity, and health benefits.I recommend the book to those who would want to do more than just read a book of information. It is designed as a workbook to be processed in the inner self and at the level of cellular knowing. Often in our system of education we follow the principle &quot;With knowledge one can attain information.&quot; One would hope, through the work of Captain Jutta, one would understand the new paradigm of education which would read, &quot;With knowing one can attain TRANSFORMATION.&quot; This Remarkable Journey can lead to that knowing and the transformations of one's life in ways that can only be &quot;Remarkable.&quot;"},{"Title":"The last of the Bohemians;: Twenty years with Leon-Paul Fargue","review":"This is an excellent book about the Latin Quarter of Paris.

My Aunt's house was three blocks South of The Corner and my memories are nothing but good of the area in the 1960's. This book demonstrates what the drug epidemic does not only to a family but to large sections of the city. Gary, Fran and DeAndre are not caught up in the epidemic, but washed away from it. Simon has a style of writing that is both entertaining, yet captivating. The psychology of what is transpiring between DeAndre and his teenage girlfriend after she discovers she is pregnant is one of the best examples of Simon's insight and style. He is very much a modern journalist, but his work in bringing a depressing and explosive environment to the reader is impressive. Read his work and watch the shows, \\"Homicide,\\" \\"The Wire,\\" \\"The Corner,\\" and the newest HBO show \\"Generation Kill\\" because Mr. Simon is the wave of not only new journalism, but new programming. I feel this is his best written work and the subject matter makes it a must read."},{"Title":"The Corner: A Year in the Life of an Inner-City Neighborhood","review":"The Corner clearly tells us about the life of inner-city neighborhoods and its inhabitants. The dark side of the world is revealed through extremely realistic descriptions, terrible moments of life that are so usual in there. The gap is deep, the suffering is obvious, hope just behind, so present in minds, but so abstract. Future is only tomorrow, violence is evidence, fear is everyday...I advise to watch The Wire, a good complement to this amazing book!"},{"Title":"The Corner: A Year in the Life of an Inner-City Neighborhood","review":"Fans of David Simon who are preparing to mourn the imminent end of The Wire on HBO should definitely check out this massively powerful book, if they haven't already done so. Simon and Burns's impressively detailed and nuanced depiction of one year on a drug corner in an impoverished Baltimore neighborhood grows into a scathing indictment, not only of the narcotics business but of a failed criminal justice system as well. This is not light reading by any stretch of the imagination, but well worth it. A hard book to forget, and that's a good thing."},{"Title":"The Corner: A Year in the Life of an Inner-City Neighborhood","review":"I think everyone in the United States should read this book. The authors put the reader on a West Baltimore corner looking at it through a first person perspective. I don't think we can understand our society and the policies we try to implement unless we understand the people these policies are directed towards. This book puts a face on the truly poor, the drug addicts, and those trapped on the brutal drug corners of many cities. The book shows the reader how so often the policies adopted by elected officials and idealogues miss the point and end up failing. When we understand the lives of those of the bottom, only then can we help them."},{"Title":"The Corner: A Year in the Life of an Inner-City Neighborhood","review":"I just finished reading The Corner for my bookclub and truly enjoyed it. Although it took a while for me to get into the book I felt more and more connected to the characters, learned about ghetto culture and understandood more the drug addict's lifestyle as the book progressed.In The Corner, opportunities were both a curse and a blessing. Gary having a job at the [...] place was good because he didn't have to do any dangerous capers. But having so much money fueled his addiction. When Fran was clean, she began to have hope for her family and her own future. But she then became very disconnected from most of her familiar life, and, in turn, very lonely and unhappy.What was clear to me is that the social structures have to be available for people. I don't think we can spend too much in this area. Every piece should be there even if they don't all work perfectly. The educational system and the justice system, which are deeply flawed served an important purpose. DeAndre was deterred from the streets out of fear of going back to the juv. detention center. Tyreeka was able to make something of her life via higher education. Access to the homeless program, drug rehab and social programs were essential stepping stones to Blue's and Fran's long term rehabilitation.By the time i finished the book, I felt connected to the folks on the corner, less judgemental and sympathetic to them and their daily struggles to survive."},{"Title":"The Corner: A Year in the Life of an Inner-City Neighborhood","review":"One of the outstanding books of our times. A powerful and compelling read. Will appeal to people from across the political spectrum. The Corner is a gem of a book!"},{"Title":"The Corner: A Year in the Life of an Inner-City Neighborhood","review":"After reading this book, I feel immense gratitude for being born into a family/neighborhood that encouraged me to succeed. This book is an eye-opener for those who have never had to deal with inner-city life and the constant battery it places on its inhabitants. The book is highly engrossing and the characters draw you in quickly. Be forewarned, once you pick this book up you will have a hard time putting it down. I took this book with me on a vacation and spent the whole time reading, and I didn't regret that decision at all!Gary McCullough is one of the most fascinating characters in any book I have read. I cried for him...what a shame that such a promising person was lost! I defy anyone to read this book and still feel contempt for people who are trapped in addiction. There are no simple solutions to the problems presented in this book, but it would be a nice change if the lawmakers in the US would at least open their eyes to the situation and make a real effort to learn about the issues that face those in the inner-cities. This book will challenge your notions of what it means to live in America, and you will never look at the inner city the same way again."},{"Title":"The Corner: A Year in the Life of an Inner-City Neighborhood","review":"WEll i first want to start off by saying that this book was amazon and i actually saw the movie on hbo first then it made me go out and pick up the book.I just wish there could have been more scenes thats how much i enjoyed it.

The authors managed to capture the essence of the corner and its entraping qualities. I found myself helplessly attached to the characters. The book, however, does indeed go too far into public policy. The authors' analysis leaves much to want and tends to generalize the problem and places blame is the conventional places.

Don't close you eyes or turn your back on this subject; considering the rate of this disaster, it will soon be in a neighborhood near you."},{"Title":"The Corner: A Year in the Life of an Inner-City Neighborhood","review":"There should be a sign posted at the corner of Fayette and Monroe Streets that reads &quot;Abandon all hope, ye who enter here&quot;. David Simon and Edward Burns take the reader on a Dantean trip through hell, leading us into the world of a drug-infested neighborhood in Baltimore. Here we meet Fat Curt, who keeps on keeping on until his body, ravaged from years of drug abuse, gives out; Ella Thompson, who never gave up on the neighborhood and its inhabitants; Gary and Fran, who threw the rich promise of their lives away on drugs, and their son DeAndre, a manchild who may never reach the promised land. Burns and Simon get us intricately involved in the lives of their subjects; and while we may react with disgust at Gary keeping on a straight course aimed at hitting rock bottom, we also feel sympathy and respect for Fran, who manages to get back up every time after she falls down. Above all, we feel the despair and disillusionment of the young people who learn from a very early age that to the rest of America, their lives have no meaning. What do these youngsters, left for the most part to raise themselves while their parents are strung out on drugs and living for nothing but their next hit, have to look forward to, when their role models are drug pushers and stickup men? Simon and Burns have been criticized for not offering answers, which would have lent an upbeat tone to this book. The criticism is beside the point. They have no answers and don't pretend to. Their aim is to show the reader how this country's &quot;anti-drug program&quot; is lacking in coherence, goals, or any kind of common sense, and in this they succeed admirably. What would have lent additional interest to this book is some exploration of how some of the people of the Corner, despite every strike being against them, manage to make positive lives for themselves when others try and fail, and some never seem to try at all: why is DeAndre still headed downhill when Preston, his friend and partner in crime, turned his life around, married, found a job, and moved his family out of the neighborhood? Why has Blue, an old Corner hand, stayed clean for three years when so many of his friends have died from drugs? How did Tyreeka, giving birth to DeAndre's son at age 14, manage to avoid another out of wedlock pregnancy, finish high school and look forward to college? And where has Fran found the strength to keep trying to get clean and stay clean when an overdose put Gary into a coffin? We can only pray that Fran stays straight this time, that DeAndre pulls his life out of the tailspin it has been going in, and that this country finally develops a meaningful drug policy that will offer some hope and some real assistance to the drug fiends on all of the nation's Corners."},{"Title":"The Corner: A Year in the Life of an Inner-City Neighborhood","review":"I am a sociology major and at times we have to read some boringbooks, but this was not one of them.

If you don't come out with a better understanding of their world, then you didn't listen to what the authors were saying."},{"Title":"The Corner: A Year in the Life of an Inner-City Neighborhood","review":"After reading and enjoying \`Homicide', I expected Simon and Burns to simply offer a conflicting story from the street perspective*. \`The Corner' exceeds the detective chronicles in presenting a compelling group of characters stuck in system that seems to be working against them.The brilliantly crafted story reads like fiction. BUT, those of you expecting \`The Wire', will find yourself on a very different journey.** The characters are richer and a larger palette is used in this Baltimore painting.While the series offered a subtle indictment of the US drug war, this book pulls no punches. Neither Simon nor Burns assign simple answers to these endemic issues, but they seem to have pinpointed the problem.Above all, this book is for those who desire a true understanding of the inner-city. While not dismissing personal responsibility, the story turns the \`bootstrap' notion on its head.\`The Corner' epitomizes how empathy grows through sustained, close examination. I'll finish with what may be my favorite paragraph in the book:\\"It's a reckoning of another kind, perhaps, and one that becomes a possibility only through the arrogance and certainty that so easily accompanies a well-planned and well-tended life. We know ourselves, we believe in ourselves; from what we value most, we grant ourselves the illusion that it's not chance and circumstance, that opportunity itself isn't the defining issue. We want the high ground; we want our own worth to be acknowledged. Morality, intelligence, values- we want those things measured and counted. We want it to be about US.\\"*which would've been fine**and you won't find a bigger \`Wire' fan than me"},{"Title":"The Corner: A Year in the Life of an Inner-City Neighborhood","review":"well i wanted to rate this book with 4 and a half stars, but thats not possible. overall this book does exatley what it claims to do, &quot;take you into a year in the life of an inner city neiboorhood.&quot; it does an exellent job of showing how a street corner works, and how people end up spending there lives on the corner. it gives faces to people who are often seen as faceeless: drug addicts. the author(s) shows you that drug addiction, violence, and crime affect PEOPLE. not just numbers. you read the paper and see that someone was arrested for possesion of crack cocaine w/ intent to distribute. but that doesn't tell you the story of who that person is, and why they were selling drugs.... his book will show you who these people are, and how good people can do bad things when their backs are against the wall. it is not possible to read this book and not feel heartfelt sympathy for the characters. you will sit up at night and wonder, &quot;what has become of deandre mccullough, and fran boyd?&quot; my only complaint about the book is it's length. it's a long read that could have been shortened by editing out a few of the authors rants against the system that treats drug addicts as criminals and not sick people. his opinion (to me at least) is correct, but he keeps coming back to these rants over and over again. and each time he says the same thing using diffrent wording. towards the end i found myself skipping through pages of these self righteous rants so i could get back to THE STORY! overall though, this book was ecquisitly done, and i would recomend that you purchase it."},{"Title":"The Corner: A Year in the Life of an Inner-City Neighborhood","review":"I had to read this book for my criminology class, and finished it early.

Mr. Simon follows around the denizens of a coke and heroin infested neighborhood in Baltimore, MD for a whole year as they deal with deindustrialization, crime, drugs, unemployment, an uncaring and unresponsive welfare system, a clueless criminal justice system, and urban blight. The withdrawal of government, industry and community from the neighborhood leaves a vacuum which is filled by what Mr. Simon calls &quot;the Corner&quot;--the open-air drug bazaar common to most American cities. People steal, strip cars and houses, and dissipate their welfare checks to feed their habit. Stepped up police and tougher laws make no dent in the problem. As the author says, if people are to say no to drugs, what is there to say yes to?The character portraits of this book are very telling and finely drawn. Especially poignant was the story of Gary, a man with a plan to leave the Corner by starting his own (legitimate) businesses and investing in stock funds. But the Corner brings him down too in the end as he succumbs to addiction, his brick home becomes a shooting gallery and his wife and children become caught up in the drug culture. Also well done was the portrait of Ella, the community activist without a community, a woman who vainly strives to instill a sense of neighborliness where none exists, where none can exist under the rules of the Corner.Mr. Simon has no words of comfort and much scorn for both liberals and conservatives. Liberals will find no solace in Simon's disdainful treatment of the educational system as largely irrelevant (as he says &quot;the students pretend to learn and the teachers learn to pretend to teach&quot;). Conservatives will reel from his repeated hectoring that the drug problem is one that will not go away after more arrests or more prisons.Mr. Simon is a master of nonfiction writing. If you like this book, check out &quot;Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Corner: A Year in the Life of an Inner-City Neighborhood","review":"Disguised in the fabulous storytelling language and rollercoaster plot that gave us HOMICIDE: LIFE ON THE STREETS, the true tale of THE CORNER turns out to be information about the foundation of our society that everyone in the U.S. needs to read. In fact, those making drug policy and welfare policy should be required by law to read this book. Anyone who loves literature will love this."},{"Title":"The Corner: A Year in the Life of an Inner-City Neighborhood","review":"I grew up in that neighborhood and many of my relatives still live there today. I believe I'm qualified to say that Simon's portrait of West Baltimore life is extremely accurate. However, the authors could have presented the complete story, Fat Curt wasn't always the soulless junky that Simon highlighted, he had a family and friends, I was one of them.Athletic talents got me out, but what of those that can't shoot a ball, or rap, or those that have to attend a West Baltimore public school. Life is tough in the ghetto, I think everyone knows that. Now Simon needs to write a book of solutions to the problem that he so profoundly explained."},{"Title":"The Corner: A Year in the Life of an Inner-City Neighborhood","review":"Ignore the second editorial review quoted at the top - they've completely missed the point, the quality, and the impact of this book. It is some of the finest writing I've ever read, from any genre, and that's only one aspect missed in the editorial review above - this isn't sociology, it's storytelling. You could almost call it the Dickens of its time and place except the stories happen to be, I'm sure mostly, true. Beautifully written, it's incredibly readable despite being about a people Simon feels are beyond hope or saving. After all, how many of us would read a sociological treatise into the lives faced by those chained to an addictive drug economy? Very few, of course, and that's at least some of the point of The Corner. Tens of thousands will read this and come to understand a world foreign to them, a world previously made opaque by a compliant and apathetic media, and ring-fenced by academics and politicians alike. It's taken a master storyteller like David Simon to partner up with Ed Burns and share their tales and insight - insights which utterly gut the pretences of those who claim to be waging a noble War on Drugs. There is no war on drugs. There never was. There is only a government-sanctioned industry of institutionalised retribution against those who live in the drug economy. Finally, for those who read and enjoyed Homicide, this is written differently but as well or better. Yes, it's that good. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Corner: A Year in the Life of an Inner-City Neighborhood","review":"The Corner is a very telling book. It gives the outsider a close-up view of the life on an inner-city drug corner. These drug corners have one simple overarching rule: You need the blast and nothing else matters. The authors also try to make sense of the whole tradgedy through their own outside comments about the police, the welfare system, and the like. In addition to that, the true story takes on the form a novel, letting you into the daily life of the McCullough family. I couldn't help but feel some type of connection with characters like DeAndre, Fran, and Gary. As I read on, I couldn't help but care for these people, to feel happy when things went right for them and to be a little sad when things went wrong. It was an enjoyable book to read, but a little repetitive. Perhaps that was the authors' plan to drive the idea home, but I think it could have been cut down a little without losing the point.

Don't forget that HBO made a mini-series out of this book too - aptly titled, \\"The Corner.\\""},{"Title":"The Corner: A Year in the Life of an Inner-City Neighborhood","review":"Most of the addicts are charming, even well-intentioned people, but still addicts, they will ultimately do whatever is necessary for their next fix. Never have I read a better exposition of the steely deadliness of drug addiction. After reading it I was in despair. I only came back to the issue because I lent somebody a copy of \\"Homicide\\" and was thinking about Simon's work. This is in many ways a much better book but you won't enjoy it.

Long and sometimes pedantic, but the characters are all real and the book lets the authors get deeper into their heads; worth a read if you're a Wire junkie. (And if you're not a Wire junkie, this will all be new to you anyway. ...but you might as well start by watching the show. Thank me later.)"},{"Title":"The Corner: A Year in the Life of an Inner-City Neighborhood","review":"If you are a fan of HBO's the Wire this is for you. I have been a fan of the David Simon/Ed Lynch team since Homicide, Life on the Streets. The Corner is the second prong of the Baltimore set books/ television series 1. Homicide 2.The Corner 3. The Wire trilogy. Similiar to Homicide, Life on the Streets, The Corner is a year long academic observation through the eyes of a team of a reporter and police officer/educator. The is no arch. No beginning/middle/end. Just the calendar. The observations are real-time, using the street's dialogue. Since, the language is unique to Baltimore at times , it could be a tough read. There are no winners or losers. No heros. No moral. No Grand Plan. No car chases. No surprises. No excitement. Just solid, plain matter of fact reporting of the life and death struggles of those who share this forgotten patch of an American urban northeast city. The book's focus is the daily struggles of the bottom dwellers/the have nots (the junkies,thieves, police, not for profits and the educators.) The book explores the dirty little secret that places like this are a reality in our America. The book sheds light on the fact that there is thin line between those in law enforcement and education and the corner. That there are American children who have been forced to be thier own parents. Surviving along aside the good parents fighting for thier own children. This book is not for those who live/d the life (city police/urban poor.) If you did not like Homicide, Life on the Streets this is not for you. If you liked Homicide, you may enjoy The Corner. For this study is deeper in the narcotic demand culture of the user/street dealer. Rather than their law enforcement brethern. If you are a fan of HBO's The Corner you will enjoy this book because although you are familair with the characters. The book will bring the characters to life and you will leave you with a better understanding of how America thrives while one of it's cities dies and is never able to resurect. This book is for the fan's of HBO's The Wire who don't understand the everyday complexities that face the poor, uneducated, under employed. This book is for academia and the Ivy Tower elite. Who enjoy the grittiness of The Wire. However, don't understand it. This book will ready those with a new skill set for the next season. Recommend."},{"Title":"The Corner: A Year in the Life of an Inner-City Neighborhood","review":"I read this book in January 1996, shortly after it came out I'm pretty sure. I saw it displayed on a bookshelf in the library and somehow was struck by its cover and decided on a whim to leaf through the first few pages. After that I couldn't put it down. The book made a searing impression on me - it's been so many years later but it is still one of those stories (a true one unfortunately) that weighs on my mind. One thing I liked about it was its honesty. It didn't pretend to know any easy answers to the problems it documented. The authors just told the story as they saw it and as truthfully as they could. Ever since then this book has been a reminder to me that every person has a whole, complicated story behind them and that making snap assumptions about someone's character or whatever because he or she is a drug addict or anything else is foolish. For all the people who are \\"successful\\" in America, you've got to wonder exactly how \\"successful\\" they'd be if they happened to be born and grow up in the kind of environment depicted in the book. That provides a different kind of test of character that most people, including myself, will likely never even face. Anyone whose only answer to these problems is made up of moralizing platitudes of whatever political stripe is full of hogwash and should be more honest with themselves. When friends told me about \\"The Wire\\" much later on, I remember thinking, hmm, that sounds awfully like that book I read - and of course it turned out that's no coincidence. I'm watching and enjoying episodes of \\"The Wire\\" on dvd now, but I would still say that this book is a whole lot more powerful and heartily recommend it to fans of the series."},{"Title":"The Corner: A Year in the Life of an Inner-City Neighborhood","review":"I bought the book after I was absolutely enthralled by the mini-series. The book and movie both give you a very emotionally capturing look into the world of the drug corners of every inner city ghetto. In the book's case, it focuses on life in the most dangerous ones of Baltimore, homicide capital of the USA. The book is a stunningly accurate portrayal of a world that is often forgotten, neglected or never talked about.So far I would say the book is even better than the mini-series as it contains much more detailed information, many new stories, and the world of the corner through the eyes of many new perspectives that are only briefly mentioned in the mini-series movie."},{"Title":"The Corner: A Year in the Life of an Inner-City Neighborhood","review":"David Simon and Ed Burns studied a typical inner-city American neighborhood over the course of a year in 1993 and this book is the journalistic enterprise that reports on what they learned. We are presented with a West Baltimore universe that could be, and most likely is, representative of any city's neighborhood that has two things: poverty and open-air drug markets. We are presented with the experiences of those involved in that drug culture and those still trying to live among it while doing what they think is right.It is a satisfying read in that you never get the sense that you are not getting the real deal. And that is the singular reason that it is so heartbreaking. To see people give so much to get out of the hell that they are in and fail again and again is almost too much to bear. You may not be able to contain your tears when you discover the final fate of Gary McCullough. You understand why this was the only way that it could have ended for him and the fact that you understand why just breaks your heart. This book is not supposed to be hopeless and it definitely is not. The authors make it pretty clear that there is a way out of this and it is certainly not what we are doing now. Until we can see these people involved in the \\"War on Drugs\\" as human beings we haven't even gone through the first step. When all we are willing to do is cut welfare and build more prisons we, and by we I mean all of us in America, are doomed.The most interesting aspect of this book are the chapter parts that sometime show up that are essentially a set of facts that elucidate the part that just happened and the ones to come. These facts apply to West Baltimore but can be generalized to any inner-city drug culture. They are very eye opening and beautifully allow you to look at things in a way that you never even thought of before. These make the lives of all of these people make so much sense but the sense is senseless. As Ella Thompson likes to say: \\"It just doesn't make sense.\\" But it does and she knows this. It is just that the knowledge is too painful."},{"Title":"The Corner: A Year in the Life of an Inner-City Neighborhood","review":"David Simon and Edward Burns have managed the seemingly unthinkable: they have written a piece of non-fiction about street level drug addicts and hustlers with compassion and humanity, that confronts rather than conceals the harshness of their lives.&quot;The Corner&quot; chronicles &quot;A Year in the Life of an Inner-City Nieghborhood,&quot; following members of the McCullough family through the streets of West Baltimore. We witness drug dealing and shooting galleries, theft and arrest and violence. We see the glimmerings of hope extinguished, and innocent lives wrent by little more than circumstance. But &quot;The Corner&quot; does more than document the course of ongoing disaster. It is a reminder of things lost, of things that should have been, and of how broad social trends have narrow human consequences.While &quot;The Corner&quot; has been criticized for its lack of proposed solutions, its most important function is not so much in advocacy, but in clarifying the human impact of social policy (or lack there-of). The pointlessness of the war on drugs, the need for real capital investment in human potential, and revealing the face of &quot;urban poverty&quot;: these are the issues that the text exemplifies. Balzac, Dickens, and Steinbeck all used fiction to advance their social arguments. Much of what the wrote was to raise awareness of conditions they found offensive: very few novels were appended with blue-prints to rebuild the world. Because the authors of &quot;The Corner&quot; use facts, they are not liable for the ressurection of West Baltimore. If there's a fire you yell fire, whether or not there's a hydrant handy.Some other works that talk about the causes of problems that are at least parallel to those observed in &quot;The Corner&quot; are Stephanie Coontz's &quot;The Way We Never Were,&quot; and discussing California and Los Angeles respectively (although having broader analytic implications) are Peter Schrag's &quot;Paradise Lost,&quot; and Mike Davis's &quot;City of Quartz.&quot; And for those who feel I'm hawking nothing but revisionist leftist history, I recomend Lawrence W. Levine's &quot;The Opening of the American Mind.&quot; So there."},{"Title":"The Corner: A Year in the Life of an Inner-City Neighborhood","review":"This is the second time I picked up this book, but finally had time to finish it. It's a difficult book to read, but very rewarding. The drug culture is so strong and takes a toll on the people. It made me want to write my congressman to request more money for treatment and rehab. A modernday Dickens, a true masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Corner: A Year in the Life of an Inner-City Neighborhood","review":"This book was absolutely moving. The story that Simon and Burns tell is brutally honest. By the end of the book, it feels as if you have spent the year on Mount and Fayette watching the struggles of DeAndre, Fran, Gary and countless others. The fact that the book is a documentary is a unnerving reminder that the problems of the inner-city are real and cannot be solved by simply throwing dollars at government programs."},{"Title":"The Corner: A Year in the Life of an Inner-City Neighborhood","review":"I read this book for my family law class and I was very impressed with the detailed characters and intense research done by the authors.

A truely amazing portrayal of human life."},{"Title":"The Corner: A Year in the Life of an Inner-City Neighborhood","review":"This book is a 1990s version of a classical sociological text, Tally's Corner, in which a researcher hung out on an urban street corner and watched the life around him. Needless to say, lots has changed, and none of it for the better. This is an unrelenting story of drugs, sex and the pressures of every day life for inner city Baltimore. Simon and Burns do an excellent job delving into the private lives of the individuals involved, and an even better job when they use a page or two to comment on the overall problem they are describing. When one of the characters happens to show up at school, they write generally about the problems facing city schools. This book isn't a 10 because it got to be, frankly, too much. Every day dragged into every other day, into the next day or drugs or gangs or smoking crack. I found myself skipping forward and not missing much. An even larger problem I found after having read through the book was the question not answered: How does anyone succeed in that environment? The book supplements what we read in the newspaper and see every day on TV. What we don't see that often, and what such a book could do, is to highlight how students do attend school and do get good grades and how families do make it, either in the neighborhood or out, in the face of such unrelenting pressures of the drug and gang culture. Those would be worthy subjects for someone's next book."},{"Title":"The Corner: A Year in the Life of an Inner-City Neighborhood","review":"&quot;The Corner reads like a brilliant, heartbreaking novel, and at the same time it's as important a social document as any to be written on such a theme.&quot; Review date 9/28/97"},{"Title":"The Corner: A Year in the Life of an Inner-City Neighborhood","review":"David Simon and Edward Burns have created a gripping and moving documentary of inner-city life. As a teacher who works not far from that corner and as a co-worker of Ella Thompson, I can tell you that everything in the book is real. I've stood on that corner and worked with Miss Ella's kids. The book hits the nail right on the head. It should be required reading for anyone thinking about working with urban issues."},{"Title":"The Corner: A Year in the Life of an Inner-City Neighborhood","review":"This is by far one of the best books on the issues of poverty, drug addiction and the failure of social services that I have ever read. But, more than that, it is the heart wrenching story of a family and neighborhood caught in the torpor of the inner city. I came to care about all of the people as though I knew them. And I finally began to understand the dynamics of drug addiction and why all of our well intentioned social programs (welfare etc.) will never save us. Awe inspiring."},{"Title":"The Corner: A Year in the Life of an Inner-City Neighborhood","review":"Simon proves that his reporting skills -- exhibited to tremendous effect in &quot;Homicide&quot; -- is no fluke. He and Burns have produced one of the three best works on urban America in the 1990s -- the others being &quot;The Promised Land&quot; by Nicholas Lemman and the film &quot;Hoop Dreams.&quot; While the story is unrelentingly grim, with only spare glimpses of hope amid the chaos of the corner, Simon and Burns do a wonderful job of making the plight of their subjects sympathetic in many cases. However, Simon and Burns engage in policy analysis that decries, accurately at times, the failure of public policy solutions, but then demure from offering cogent alternatives. Moreover, the epilogue seems to counter the book's overall point of view -- that addiction is far too complicated to solve with messages of self-reliance -- by portraying the successful (to date) recoveries of Fran Boyd and Blue as acts of sheer will. Nevertheless, the book is fascinating throughout and draws the reader to hope against hope that al"},{"Title":"The Corner: A Year in the Life of an Inner-City Neighborhood","review":"&quot;These characters transcend stereotype.

This book gives faces to people who are often seen as nobody and faceless; drug addicts. David Simon and Edward Burns showed me that drug addiction, violence, and crime affect people, not just numbers. When you read the paper and see that someone was arrested for possession of crack cocaine with intent to distribute (sell), yeah now your informed but that doesn't tell you the story of who that person is, and why they were selling drugs. This book will show you who these people are, and how good people can do bad things when their backs are against the wall and they can't turn either way. This book will definitely grab your heart and you can't help but feel sympathy for the characters. One complaint about the book is its length. It's a long read that could have been shortened by editing out a few of the authors long spiels against the system that treats drug addicts as criminals and not sick people. Also I felt it started kind of slow and there were a few parts I was wondering if the story would speed up. Its like the authors were repeating themselves saying the same thing just using different wording. Towards the end I liked this book a lot but glad that the end was near. Overall though, this book was great, and would recommend it to anyone who can relate to this lifestyle or topic and anyone who is interested. You definitely have to care though because it can be slow at times."},{"Title":"The Corner: A Year in the Life of an Inner-City Neighborhood","review":"Wonderful book.

Also a must read for any Homicide or The Wire fans."},{"Title":"The Corner: A Year in the Life of an Inner-City Neighborhood","review":"this book took me back to an area i grew-up in and escaped from in my early 20s. I've known many persons such as the characters in this book. They are real and do exist unfortantly. I am now employed and daily working with the court system in Baltimore, Maryland where I grew up. I know that some of these characters lives have not changed for the better at least because i've seen them in court. I know that the areas are worse than before because I visit them to do home visits for my job, and I know that the police still perform as they did when the book was written, and Baltimore's crime rate remains the same. Sad as it is, ther are still no real solutions to the problem that the arthors wrote about, and the corners are still in existance, but the players, or shall I say victims are becoming younger everyday. The faces are new and the conditions are worse. The Corner, in my opinion is a powerful story. Unlike some readers, I at times had to but it down, collect myself, and then pick it up at a latter time. To be in it, but not of it was hard and always is. To see that someone else has taken the time to witness it and but it into story is heartwrenching. I know these characters, feel for them, cry for them, and each day I pray for them."},{"Title":"The Corner: A Year in the Life of an Inner-City Neighborhood","review":"The Corner is one of those stories that stops us out-to-save-the-world types in our tracks. What do you do with a situation like this? Police, politicians, charitable organizations, treatment centers, educators, and tireless optimistic reformers seem to be completely ineffective throughout the book. The book has its bright spots: when someone goes into rehab, when a long-term user leaves the corner for good, when one of the kids returns to school. But everyone knows, and the reader begins to have a sense, that the changes don't last long and tragedy will strike again, so why hope?But the book is much more than a recounting of failed social programs and policing. The Corner is the story of real people with real desires and dreams. All have dreams beyond the corner, but none have a way to get there. Some have fallen from successful pasts, and some were born into the strange West Baltimore economy of buying, selling, and using. The authors looked closely enough to know that Gary was once a successful businessman, that Fran was once planning to attend college, that Blue is an accomplished artist. But to most of America, they are faceless drug addicts who should know better, who should clean themselves up and get out of there.As the yearlong account unfolds, it is clear that getting &quot;out of there&quot; is not a realistic option. Few have any support system to speak of, and the government programs designed to help don't always-even if someone manages to navigate the endless bureaucracy. In the end, the corner triumphs in all but a few cases. The Corner is an eye-opening story that asks us to become aware of the people caught in situations like these in inner-city America. They are real people who have become completely detached from society at large, but they are still human beings. The book does not provide any answers, but it provokes thought as to what could possibly bring the people of every Fayette Street in every West Baltimore a glimmer of real hope.&quot;Empathy demands that we recognize ourselves in the faces at Mount and Fayette, that we acknowledge the addictive impulse as something more than simple lawlessness, that we begin to see the corner as the last refuge of the truly disowned.&quot; ---David Simon and Edward Burns"},{"Title":"The Corner: A Year in the Life of an Inner-City Neighborhood","review":"I am a white suburban woman who began to read this book to learn about a life that is very different from my own and because I wanted to learn about the IV drug culture, having a cousin who shot drugs in NYC for 15 years. This book should be read by anyone who thinks that have the answer to the ills of the city, or education, or healthcare, or poverty or whatever. They will quickly see that the problems that plague our inner cities are much like trying to treat a cancer in the human body: you can't try and single out or isolate one specific problem area and try to fix it. You need to look at the entire system, taking into account the interconnectedness of these problems when you try and come up with a solution.It is naive and utterly foolish to think that you can isolate the issues of the city and solve them independently- you can't. I urge anyone who has any influence over public policy of any kind to spend a few days and read this book. It will forever alter your view on how to &quot;fix&quot; the problems of neighborhoods like these and make you realize you are up against something that is much bigger than it appears. And policy makers: it is not as easy as as having a war on drugs. You need to start by bringing a thriving economic job base back into our cities so people have the opportunity to become meaningfully employed and can try and have a chance at life. When you strip away one's economic opportunities- you are cutting off their blood supply. It is just that simple.

Here is why: First, it is well-written and intriguing. There is little to no academic jargon to wade through. It is a plain spoken book about the realities of inner-city life. It is not difficult to read in a literary sense, but certainly in an ethical and moral sense. This brings me to the second reason why I found it to be such an important book: It puts a face on the experiences of poor minorities living in urban areas. I'm 23 and I've been working in inner-city communities since I was 15. When I hear people talk disparagingly about minorities, inner-city youth, single moms, &quot;welfare moms,&quot; my heart breaks, and in many ways, I am also angry that people talks so much about a life they know so little about. I found that this book accurately put a face on the people who are so often referred to as one statistics or another (related to drugs, single moms, incarceration, welfare). There was no glorification and little over-victimization of the people in the book and their experiences as poor, black, and affected by drugs and the underground economy. This book should be required reading for all Americans who wish to learn more about and develop informed opinions about poor, inner-city communities and the people who live there. I find it particularly relevant to those interested in drug laws and sentencing, as well as access to drug treatment. I think that this would also be a very helpful book for people who work in urban areas or are planning to someday (social work, education, ministry). The book leaves very big questions to be answered by the reader. How do I judge the people in this book? What would I do if I grew up in such a community? How do I go forth from here? A very powerful book."},{"Title":"The Corner: A Year in the Life of an Inner-City Neighborhood","review":"&quot;The Corner,&quot; by David Simon and Edward Burns, is one of the best books I've ever read.Nothing I've seen or read humanizes inner-city drug fiends, pushers, gang members quite like this does. By gaining the trust of the people of Monroe and Fayette streets in West Baltimore, the authors were able to put the reader in their shoes, capture their thoughts, dreams, and histories.Rather than glamorize drug use and gang violence as many books and movies do, it plainly shows the heartache experienced and the physical, emotional, and social barriers faced by people living in inner-cities.So many judge themselves to be morally and intellectually superior to those living in the inner-cities of our country. Simon and Burns do a masterful job demonstrating people of inner-city neighborhoods, for the most part, are victims of circumstance and, given the same upbringing, the same surroundings, the same resistance, those outsiders who judge them harshly would live no differently.Published in 1997, &quot;The Corner&quot; has received mostly glowing reviews. The few criticisms hurled its way usually center around a lack of solutions offered. Simon and Burns do not have the answers and don't pretend to.Their book effectively argues society's &quot;war on drugs&quot; has not only failed miserably, but is actually a war on the underclass itself.If a solution is to be reached in the upcoming century, it will be through a drastic change in attitude of the &quot;haves&quot; towards the &quot;havenots.&quot; This book and others like it may go a long way towards changing opinions and ultimately sparking a solution. I challenge the Rush Limbaughheads out there to read &quot;The Corner.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Corner: A Year in the Life of an Inner-City Neighborhood","review":"The Corner was given to me by my fiance, who grew up two blocks from the actual 'corner'. Many of the individuals in the book were people he knew from childhood, grade school, the play grounds...I had the opportunity to ask many questions about people like Blue, Fat Curt, Gary, etc. These people became real to me and I was pulling for all of them to make it - to escape - to survive. My fiance left Baltimore for another life - but realizing that he grew up amidst the turmoil and temptation of The Corner - has given me a greater respect for him. He escaped - God help all of those who weren't so fortunate. I highly recommend this book to anyone - but especially to those who have never experienced the harsh reality of the inner city up close and personal. And once you read it, share it with a friend so everyone can come to realize how far this country has to come."},{"Title":"The Corner: A Year in the Life of an Inner-City Neighborhood","review":"Books don't get much more powerful or moving than this.The premise is simple--Baltimore Sun reporter Simon (who's lately been earning acclaim as the driving force behind HBO's \\"The Wire\\" which takes place in the same area). spent a year living on or around one of the busiest drug markets in Baltimore and reports what he learned. In doing so, he tells the stories of the people who inhabit this world, street pushers, kids trying (although often not that hard) to stay straight and the parents who worry about them, when they're not too busy trying to score their next fix. The stories are harrowing--from hardcore junkies who spend their days cashing in scrap metal for cash to earn their next fix to families sharing one small bedroom in a walk up shooting gallery. Pretty much everybody is hoping for a change in fortunes, but the book offers few happy endings. In spite of this, its a fascinating glimpse of a world where most of Simon's readers will never go.The narrative is occasionally broken up by Simon's musings about the war on drugs. No matter where you fall on the political spectrum, its hard to disagree with Simon's belief that the war has failed, at least in this little corner of the world. There's a particularly powerful passage near the end where Simon flat out shatters the Horatio Alger myths that many middle-class suburbanites cling to, particularly the idea that should they find themselves in that situation, they'd simply apply a little Puritan gumption and work their way out their unfortunate circumstances. In the end, he doesn't offer any solutions and precious little hope.Yet, the characters who populate the corner are more than mindless junkies. They're human, with hopes and dreams and stories to tell. Perhaps Simon's greatest achievement is the way in which he employs his sharp eye and powers of observation to paint a wholly three-dimensional and, given the circumstances, refreshingly non-judgmental picture of a community in deep decline.In the end, its an amazing powerful read, one that will leave readers deeply affected and likely having shed at least a couple of tears along the way."},{"Title":"The Corner: A Year in the Life of an Inner-City Neighborhood","review":"Reading 'The Corner', you are transported into West Baltimore and the life of the denizens of Monroe and Fayette. David Simons and Ed Burns attempts to put a face to the addicts that are normally ignored in people's everyday life.I was saddened by the hoplelessness and despair that most of the people felt, and also by the fact that these were real people, not characters that could be filed away for a later time. To use a worn cliche, this book is indeed an eye opener, telling the tale of people who fell and have no reason to hope for anything beyond the next blast from a pipe.This is not a book for the faint. The scenes are graphic and the writing allows for the reader to be there in real time as an observer.The writers chronicle a year in the life of residents who have their shares of ups and downs, positive and negative experiences. This is a book to be read with an open mind and open heart."},{"Title":"The Corner: A Year in the Life of an Inner-City Neighborhood","review":"Having Not Only Read this Book but being in Enviroments such as this it's Something that A Larger Part OF Society refuses too Acknowledge.This Book Pulls No punches about The Surroundings.Drugs,Education&amp;Healthy Living are Something that all People want&amp;deserve.I got Mad Respect For HBO&amp;Charles Dutton for Bringing this Powerful Book too the Eyes.it's Ashame when Folks say that's their Problem.it's not a One-Sided thing it's America's Problem.Their is No WAR ON DRUGS!it's a WAR on People that Become Addicted Too them.People Matter No Matter What.it's very SAD&amp;Racist.for Folks want changes Read this Book&amp;try too Understand the Depths OF Pain felt.People Need OPPURTUNITY NOT INSTITUTION."},{"Title":"The Corner: A Year in the Life of an Inner-City Neighborhood","review":"I live only a few miles or so away from the area described in &quot;The Corner,&quot; and have no doubt passed it many times, but it might as well be another world. The closest I ever got to realizing what the people on the corner of Monroe and Fayette Streets in Baltimore go through every day was a couple of visits I made to one of the elementary schools that is mentioned in the book, as part of a &quot;Big Brother&quot;-type program several years ago. And I was pretty young then, so I really didn't notice much. But still, the harrowing, hard-hitting, and heartbreaking tale of the parents and older siblings of the kids I met there, kids who were destined to follow in their footsteps just a few years after I left, held me in its grip for the most part. I was stunned to learn of the realities of Baltimore's inner city that until now I really did only hear about in reports on the evening news. David Simon and Edward Burns' reporting is so intimate, you really feel like you're right there. Even though I never knew DeAndre, Gary, Fran, Curt, Ella, or R.C., or the dozens of other characters in the book, I really felt as though I'd come to know them and was caught up in and moved by their stories.The stories of these people certainly tell the tale of the utter hoplessness of drug addiction on the streets, except for the privileged few, but here is the only real flaw in the book: Simon and Burns feel it necessary to stop frequently and spend about 10 pages bashing the &quot;drug war,&quot; arguing that it is incompetent and that for every soul who is rescued, a million more, and millions more after them, will be stuck on the streets no matter what we try to do. After reading about such people in firsthand accounts, we get that point pretty well. The authors overstate it almost to the point of overkill, and only make the book longer by doing so, but eventually, the story always takes over again and drives that point home much better than all those diatribes.If you think you know what the drug culture in the inner city is really like, then think again. And read &quot;The Corner,&quot; which puts a human face (Actually, many human faces) on the tragedy and will certainly help you see it through new eyes."},{"Title":"The Corner: A Year in the Life of an Inner-City Neighborhood","review":"David Simon's follow-up to Homicide, The Corner, is a look at the other side of the Baltimore crime beat. Simon and his collaborator, Burns, spent a year observing an active drug corner and the lives of it's key players and inhabitants. At times funny, triumphant, brooding, heartbreaking, and always compelling, their observations and insight into the reality of America's war on drugs, and the utter failure of drug policy, is eye opening. You'll never look at the drug problem, or the criminal justice system, the same way after reading this."},{"Title":"The Corner: A Year in the Life of an Inner-City Neighborhood","review":"The copy of \\"The Corner\\" I ordered had been released from a library in Virginia because of, the red stamp in the front of the book read, \\"low demand.\\" Therein lies a reflection of the tragedy at the heart of the book.David Simon and Edward Burns portray a year in the life of a drug-ravaged West Baltimore neighborhood -- \\"the corner\\" -- represented primarily by Fayette and Monroe streets, the site of one of numerous open-air drug markets in the area. But \\"the corner\\" is also an entity, in Simons' and Burns' telling, a being that draws residents to it, demands their money and daily commitment and ultimately consumes them in their daily quest for a \\"blast.\\"A clutch of characters the two reporters followed live at the heart of this big, vital book. Fran Boyd and Gary McCullough, each addicts, are parents to DeAndre McCullough, a teenager slipping toward the corner. In the course of the year DeAndre fathers a child with 14-year-old Tyreeka Freamon, ultimately all but abandoning them. Various members of DeAndre's crew and \\"touts\\" for the dealers slide in and out of the narrative, many of them drifting toward death or prison.There is also a moving portrayal of Ella Thompson, a stubborn organizer of community resources who struggles mightily to wrest the underlying humanity she still sees in her neighborhood to the surface.Throughout the book the authors keep the reader teetering on a razor's edge of fear and very slim hope. The people who inhabit \\"The Corner\\" are damaged people. As a middle-class person I found myself disappointed and angry when DeAndre blows off a job for no good reason or Fran struggles bravely toward kicking her habit but falls back or the tout \\"Fat Curt,\\" gravely ill, fails to adhere to the medical care he so desperately needs. And we wonder why Gary, one of many members of a solid, hardworking family and a man who had gained a large measure of success and security in his life slid into an abyss of addiction.\\"The Corner\\" is not without a point of view on this subject. The book is an indictment of the futility of the war on drugs, the ineptitude of the public school system and the frankly uncaring attitude of governments at all level toward people they view as expendable in the grand scheme of American life.This book is painstakingly detailed, a masterpiece of sociological observation, but it is not a old, clinical report of a crumbling neighborhood. The authors look at what they see clearly and unflinchingly and allow the voices of their subjects to shine through. Those voices may make you uncomfortable, they may make you angry, they may make you nod in agreement, they may make you laugh. They are always real, and the authors' connection to them is obvious.I am afraid that books like the \\"Corner,\\" which portray urban life in the early and mid-90s, will more than ever be consigned to dusty library corners or the shelves of private collections like my own. Listen to the rhetoric of the 2012 presidential race and it's clear how completely the descendants of the characters on \\"The Corner\\" have been marginalized. While we wring our hands about \\"the middle class,\\" another class continues to struggle, as it has for years, outside our view.I was grateful for the small ray of hope that emerged at the end of \\"The Corner.\\" Grateful because it had to fight its way through so many layers of the sadness that is at the heart of this unforgettable book."},{"Title":"The Corner: A Year in the Life of an Inner-City Neighborhood","review":"There is nothing new that I can add in praise of this book. What's depressing, disgusting, even, is that in the 14 years since this book was written nothing has changed for the better. As reviewer B. Marshall so succinctly stated: \\"There is no war on drugs. There never was. There is only a government-sanctioned industry of institutionalised retribution against those who live in the drug economy.\\" This is as true under Obama as it was under Nixon and everyone in between. The concept is so fundamentally flawed that it's hard to believe adult human beings thought it up.In any case... The primary purpose of this review is to reiterate the opinion of a 1997 reviewer: if you have not done so, you should read \\"Tally's Corner\\" by Elliot Liebow. Liebow wrote about an inner-city corner in Washington D.C. 30 years before Simon and Burns. The juxtaposition of the two books gives enormous emphasis to the rather horrid (though unfortunately not surprising) changes that occurred in those 30 years. Which, interestingly, include the entire span of The War on Drugs."},{"Title":"The Corner: A Year in the Life of an Inner-City Neighborhood","review":"I've lived in Baltimore my entire life.

Well, even of the heroin addicts, that'snot true. The books makes excuses for bad behavior -- living in sucha neighborhood = a criminal, drug-addled lifestyle. But we seeinstances in which the facts of the book prove this to be incorrect,e.g., the guy who joins the Navy, Ella, and -- to a lesser degree --Ella's son.The authors disagree, but one could find ample evidence here that thedrug war is winnable -- it would just take some juvenile justicereform, some judges and and an electorate with the backbone toenforce the law. The cops scoop 'em up, but they're right back atit, as judges mete out probation after probation. The authors say,\\"What's the solution? More prisons?\\" dismissively, but perhaps thatis the solution, as the average person who is engaged in criminalactivity full-time commits 400+ felonies per year -- at a cost tosociety far outweighing the cost of incarceration. Also, after thisbook was published, in the 1990s, tax increases to fund prison buildswere among the only popular taxes with voters and there wasevidence that higher incarceration rates lead to lower rates ofcrime.The book also makes it all too clear that the welfare state,supposedly gutted in the Reagan 80s, makes it all to easy for nonetoo deserving (in the sense that they largely or wholly created theirown problems -- by quitting jobs, using drugs, etc.) recipients toget a check. The authors claim the welfare payments (at the time) of$250 or so aren't much money, but ignore facts to the contrary intheir own book, e.g., no one has any money in West Baltimore, sothat's quite a bit in comparison, whole families were paying $30 permonth rent, etc."},{"Title":"The Corner: A Year in the Life of an Inner-City Neighborhood","review":"I had heard quite a bit of positive buzz about this book, but if the &quot;characters&quot; weren't based on real people, this book would be the worst sort of white liberal breast-beating silliness. I had read Homicide, which was a somewhat compelling trashy book - at least the author had something in common with the people he was writing about.However, in this book, we get white man's guilt by two white men who, by hanging out with drug abusers for a year, believe that they give us a &quot;gritty view of the American dream gone bad&quot; or whatever the book jacket says. I think that by far the worst part of this book are the occasional glimpses into the &quot;inner thoughts&quot; of the characters, such as when Tyreeka ponders why DeAndre is chasing other girls, not paying attention to her at Christmas dinner, etc. C'mon, Tyreeka was thinking &quot;I wonder if I like vanilla?&quot; These &quot;characters&quot; are not the most introspective of people, so we mostly get Simon's introspections on their life.Fran, Fat Curt, Gary and the other castaways would have ended up at the bottom no matter where they had started.

Here she recalls her childhood and life in Brooklyn as the protected daughter of a leading doctor, and her romantic marriage to Bill during World War I. She also tells how AA and Al-Anon started and how they have brought hope to more than a million alcoholics and those who love them.She recalls idyllic summer days in beautiful rural Vermont and long hiking and motorcycling trips with Bill. Later came darker times when she and Bill tried vainly to conquer his illness of alcoholism. Then Bill's spiritual awakening led to his meeting with Dr. Bob S. in Akron, Ohio, and the formation of Alcoholics Anonymous.Lois tells how the Twelve Steps and the Twelve Traditions grew out of the early experiences of AA members and groups, and were later adopted by Al-Anon. Her steadfast support and love for Bill were important throughout their marriage, but she found she needed her own program of recovery. Out of this need and that of other spouses and children of alcoholics grew Al-Anon for alcoholics' families and friends, and Ala-teen for their children.Here is the personal story of the co-founders of AA and Al-Anon as Lois recounts it, beginning with their struggles - some heartbreaking, some hilarious - all from her own unique perspective."},{"Title":"Lois Remembers: Memoirs of the Co-Founder of Al-Anon and Wife of the Co-Founder of Alcoholics Anonymous","review":"More & more we see that alcoholism and drug addiction are \\"family illnesses,\\" since they affect not only the one hooked on the substances, but everyone in that person's \\"circle\\" of family, friends & co-workers. Even after the sufferer \\"sobers up,\\" the family has quite a bit of healing and re-adjustment to do. This book is very important in several respects. First, it's great as a biography of AA co-founder Bill Wilson's life, since he and Lois were together for so many years. Second, this is great history: Lois wasn't a drunk, so while her husband was able to share his perspective \\"As Bill Sees It,\\" being sober, and charged with so much responsibility in the family, Lois could write this book from the perspective of one who actually \\"Remembers\\" the events. Thirdly, and perhpas most important, Lois survived a significant time after her husband passed. She helped create Al-Anon (the groups created for those who are \\"affected\\" by alcoholism in their family or friends), was an active participant and saw it & AA grow over quite a period of time and can share her perspectives on WHAT works and WHY it works. 12-Step programs have saved and improved millions of lives already, just in the past 75 years.

She really brings you into the story and I swear that there are times I feel like I personally know the charachters. She has such talent...This book did not disappoint. Yes, I realize that Nora has done a few other trilogies and they all tend to be similar in some ways, but they are all so good that why should she fix something that isn't broken? I really liked the characters of Dana and Jordan. Their chemistry was amazing! The steam just came off of the pages in some scenes. I love how NR made all three of the couples crystal clear from the first book. This way we have something to look forward to in the third book.

The first book set the stage, introduced all the characters and really got the reader into the story line of good vs. evil. Book two continued the story and the last book tied up all the loose ends and was a good completion to the overall theme. All the characters are important in each book and they continue to evolve throughout the books and become better at recognizing when they are being tricked by the bad guy (Kane). Each woman has to grow in some way - overcome her fears, face her own inner demons (something Kane preyed upon), in order to find her true happiness (happily with a wonderful guy - in traditional Nora Roberts fashion). Good does overcome evil and wonderful friendships are established. This is a &quot;feel good&quot; series that will keep you on the edge as Kane becomes meaner and meaner as he loses the battle."},{"Title":"Key of Knowledge (Key Trilogy 2)","review":"This is a great second book for this trilogy.

The box can only be opened by three keys by the hands of three mortal women.Three woman come together and are asked if they want to take on this quest and are each given twenty-five thousand dollars, but if they succeed they will each get a million dollars.

Jordan knows what the evil God Kane will do to stop Dana from finding the second key and Jordan will do everything in his power to keep her safe.This book was a little sad...Although Jordan left Dana on a whim, he was trying to escape this past and make the present a better one...it was very hard losing his mother the way she died and it tore at him inside and out....You can really feel the pain and heartache...It's a supernatural story of legends and magic and love.

It is now Dana's turn to find the second key,that stands for knowledge. Beside her stands Jordan Hawke, a writer who was Dana's former lover who left her to become a writer, who came back to lay claim back home. I enjoy this book even more than Key of Light and that book is hard to beat. I enjoy the ineractions that the characters have together especially Zoe's and Brad's comments to each other. Also Moe the dog makes his apperances and Simon, Zoe's young son also plays a bigger part. New characters also make it interesting. Can't wait for Key of Valor,when Zoe will have to find the third Key. I know Brad and the others will also have a bigger part in this book of series. I know it will be exciting.

Jordan is Dana's brothers' best friend, so their relationship started out with friendship, but turned to love. He broke her heart when he abruptly left town after the death of his mother. Jordan has returned as a successful writer, but also with a history attached to Warriors Peak. He has always been fascinated with the old house, so much so that he based one of his best selling books on it.As Dana and Jordan search for the second key, it becomes apparent that they must resolve their past, and look into their future together if they are going to locate the second key.

Dana was an annoying character who couldn't get over the fact that her heart was broken by the man she loved when she was 20. When Jordan walks back into her life eight years later, she is determined to hate him and keep him at a distance. Unfortunately, most of the story is about her trying to avoid Jordan and get him out of her system.The plot about searching for the key to unlock the souls of the goddesses seemed to be an afterthought. Dana spends most of her time searching through books with the word \\"key\\" or \\"goddess\\" in the title, hoping the key will fall out of one of them. Throw in a few events with Kane, the evil god and that pretty much sums up the entire plot. This book is necessary to read if you want to finish the series, but not worth keeping on the shelf."},{"Title":"Key of Knowledge (Key Trilogy 2)","review":"This is series is wonderful!

Strong women, strong men who love them, a touch of the mystical, add a difficult quest, and bang, you have the makings of a great read, in my opinion. In this second in the Key trilogy, it is book-lover Dana's turn to find the mysterious key that will unlock the souls of the three lost princesses. Naturally she resembles one of the princesses in the series of paintings of them. And just as naturally she falls in love along the way and finds the key . . . .I love how the three main female characters continue to forge a strong relationship in this book, just as the three main men. I also love how they are working together not only to complete the quest, but also to create a new business and new lives for themselves. And never once does anyone whine about anything--I love that, too!I do not usually prefer books set in the modern day, but in Nora Roberts; case, I make exceptions. I have found that her work is hit or miss for me, I either love it or hate it. This series I love! And if you're like me, you will too. Do yourself a favor, buy Key of Valor at the same time so you can dive right into it when you're done. Buy a box of Godiva, put a fire in the fireplace and take a weekend for YOU!"},{"Title":"Key of Knowledge (Key Trilogy 2)","review":"Key of Knowledge picks up right where part one (Key of Light) left off. In Nora Roberts excellent Celtic goddesses/lost souls/contemporary seekers trilogy, Malory, Dana, and Zoe are reuinited once again to continue the quest for the three keys to release three lookalike goddesses from their eternal prison. Part two is Dana's story; as with Malory, she has job issues (she is unfairly fired from her position at the library), and man issues (in the person of ex-lover, lifelong-friend, and soon-to-be Major Squeeze Jordan Hawke, the famous writer whose books she secretly reads with pride), not to mention dog issues (did you think Moe, the wonderdog who supplied so much humor and life to Key of Light, would be left out of the new volume? Heavens to Snoopy, No!!). Since she was a librarian and is soon to be a bookstore owner (in Indulgence, the delicious bookstore/beauty salon/art gallery the three women plan to open), it follows that writing and books should play a major role in her finding the Key of Knowledge. Oh, yes, Kane, the ultraegotistic supernatural villian, is back as well. This celestial scumbag has taken an oath to play by the rules; he soon breaks them by physically attacking Jordan. It will take the combined efforts of all three women, their men, plus Rowena and Pitt to overcome his snares in this installment. While this volume is a worthy successor to Key of Light, a few questionable choices make this installment less successful than it's predecessor. One: Dana is a little too quick to believe Kane and his illusions and thus doubt the sincerity of Jordan's love (at first, anyway). She knows Kane means to hurt her, why let him win? The second choice is harder to address without giving away too much of the plot; suffice it to say that Jordan, as a writer, should have more control over his own work at the story's climax. He created it, why shouldn't he be able to control every aspect of his book? Still, the genuine warmth and friendship between the three women, the strength and courage of their convictions, and the effective conclusion of this second installment will have you waiting anxiously for Key of Valor, Zoe's story and the final piece in the trilogy's puzzle. Read Key of Knowledge right away, secure that this book is indeed an excellent followup to Key of Light, and when you are finished, lose no time in starting Key of Valor at once. Magic, romance, and the friendship that only three incredible women can create await your immediate attention!!"},{"Title":"Key of Knowledge (Key Trilogy 2)","review":"Another deeply satisfying Nora trilogy continues with Book 2, which is the story of Dana, one of the three very modern Pennsylvania women who find themselves on an ancient Celtic quest complete with gods and goddesses, ancient curses, and the like.As readers of the first book know, the first key was found by Mallory, and it's now Dana's turn to find the second key, one of the three that must be found to free the souls of three entrapped goddesses. Sound corny? Yes...but not when Nora writes it! That is her great gift, as her fans know all too well. So along we go with Dana, and talk about pressure: She's about to lose her job; she's fighting unwanted romantic feelings about an old lover; and she has only 28 days to find the key or let down three goddesses and two women who have become her best friends overnight.I could not put this book down, anymore than I could the first, and am horrified to see I have to wait several weeks for the final book in the trilogy!

Previous fans of Nora Roberts's trilogies will be pleased because Key delivers a wonderful romanace about ex-lovers reconciling and falling in love again, where previous book Face the Fire disappointed. Jordan and Dana are quick witted characters who will make you laugh and possibly cry. Added to the main plot, the story of Mallory and Flynn from Key of Light continues and the story of Key of Valor is set up. All the while the reader works along with Dana in her quest to find the Key, and possibly herself. This is Nora Roberts at her best, giving readers a fun, intriguing, heart warming book.

I'll admit right away that I gave the first instalment of the trilogy (Key of Light) a less-than-glowing 2 star review, but I enjoyed this second instalment a whole lot more for a variety of reasons.Firstly, I really liked Dana's character; she was witty, feisty and fun. Most of all I loved how obsessive she was around books - been there, done that :-). The book really got to me emotionally because Dana and Jordan were clearly meant for each other. With Malory and Flynn in the last book I just didn't get the feeling that without each other they wouldn't be complete, but that x-factor was definitely there for Dana and Jordan. The chemistry between them sizzled and I was in tears when Jordan talked about his mother's death and when the couple finally got back together. The plot was pretty good although I confess the Goddess stuff went over my head and I skimmed some of those parts. The development of the other romances moved along quite nicely too.Overall this review is a 4 star rather than 5 because I'm still not loving the supernatural elements &agrave; la Rowena and Pitte and all the Goddess stuff. I think that anyone who is passionate about books would like this novel as they would relate to Dana and Jordan. I have a feeling that people who aren't real booklovers will not get Dana's character at all, but for me reading about her was like looking in a mirror.JoAnne"},{"Title":"Key of Knowledge (Key Trilogy 2)","review":"Dana is a hilarious character, in the many ways she puts things ever so bluntly. I thought the first one would be my favorite, but this one, upon reading it became my favorite of the trilogy.

In this novel we are reintroduced to Dana Steele and her story. Dana has had her heartbroken by Jordan Hawke many years ago, and never been fully able to get over him or the resulting heartache. Unfortunately for her Jordan is integral to this journey which means spending a lot of time with the one person she has envisioned dying a slow and painful death.I liked Dana because of her flaws. Dana loves to read and spends her time doing what she loves only to find her foundation shaken from underneath her. She not only has to wrestle with her pride and heartache, but the future and it's possibilities. As she and her soul sisters open up their minds and hearts to each other as they form a business relationship. Dana finds it tougher to do the same in regards to Jordan.

It is the story of Dana Steele and Jordan Hawke. Dana and Jordan had a past - he was her first love and left Pleasant Valley quite abruptly after his mother died to make something of his writing career in NYC. He broke Dana's heart at the time and she has never forgotten or forgiven him. Now, years later, and with a successful career as a writer under his belt, he has returned and found himself connected to the search for the second key. Jordan has always been mesmerized and quite drawn to Warrior's Peak to the point that he wrote a best seller, Phantom Watch, based on his boyhood experiences with friends Brad and Flynn at the mystery mansion. This connection ties him into librarian Dana's life once more and the search for the second key. This quest becomes much more dangerous than the first. The evil sorcerer, Kane, is not playing by the rules and someone's blood will be shed before the end of this sequel. Dana must dig deep into her soul in order to find the answers and the piece to her puzzle. Jordan is an integral part of that missing piece and she must come to terms with her life with him, past and present, if she is to have a chance at finding the second key. This story is an excellent continuation of the series; lots of adventure, camaraderie among the chosen six, Malory, Flynn, Dana, Jordan, Zoe and Brad and of course romantic entanglements as only Nora can project. I would highly recommend it after reading \\"Key of Light\\" and pass on that you will want to go directly to the final book \\"Key of Valor.\\""},{"Title":"Key of Knowledge (Key Trilogy 2)","review":"It's Dana Steele's turn to find her key in order to free the trapped Goddesses. Part of her quest involves coming to terms with the love she had for her former flame, Jordan Hawke, best selling author. As they join forces to solve the riddle and defeat the evil Kane, their love grows strong once again, just in time to try to save Dana's life, and the souls of the Daughters of Glass.This was not a bad story but this trilogy seems to be dragged out a bit much. The focus of this story is on Dana and Jordan, but too much time in spent exploring the beginning love between Zo and Brad. Nora Roberts should make sure she remembers the focus of the story and doesn't risk having another, secondary relationship steal the show.I do love the concept of the Celtic Goddesses imrisoned and that only three humans can free them. The magical bend to this story will certainly appeal to fans of the paranormal romance genre. Without the Goddesses and their long suffering guardians Rowena and Pit, there would be no story."},{"Title":"Key of Knowledge (Key Trilogy 2)","review":"In this second book in The Key Trilogy one of the most brilliant characterizations of a fictional character exists.

Through all of this, she is starting a business with Mallory and Zoe, her compatriots in this fantastical journey. The range of every human emotion, danger, suspense, humor and a wonderful love story emerge in a swirling pool of carefully constructed magic, love and courage. It is wonderful and I cannot recommend this book strongly enough, along with Key of Light and Key of Valor, the first and third in the series.

In each generation three human women are born who have the means to find the three keys and end the curse. Each, in turn, has one moon phase to find a key. If the first fails, game over. If the first succeeds, the second woman takes up the quest, and so on. If any of the three mortal females fail, they each lose an undisclosed year of her life. If all three succeed, the demi-goddesses will awaken and each of the three human women will receive one million dollars.Malory succeeded in her quest. The first key has been found. The first lock has been opened on the Box of Souls. Dana Steele's quest begins. Dana's talent and quest is in knowledge, her love of books and information. This novel focuses on Dana's true love, Jordan. Jordan is a highly successful author of dark novels. Problem is that Jordan dumped Dana years ago and walked out of her life without looking back. Now that he is famous and returned, he seems to expect to just pick up with Dana where he left off. NOT! Worse, the entire time all is happening, the evil sorcerer, Kane, watches.**** Okay, not as good as the first, but still well worth a solid four stars! More time is spent on Dana and Jordan (as a couple) and the store &quot;Indulgence&quot; (that the women are putting together) than on the quest, itself.

Well the first book was great and the Key of Knowledge is just as hard to put down. I have never read so many books that I just did not want to end.

Some in their world revolted against their existence, offended by their links to mortality. One such god, Kane, rose up against the king and his progeny, and in a moment, a single moment when the demigoddesses' protectors had dropped their guard, he attacked with swift vengeance and wicked sorcery. In the aftermath, three souls were stolen and three sisters lay as if asleep, their souls captured in a box secured by three locks, three keys at their motionless feet. For three thousand years, the protectors have searched for the three mortals to find the three keys, and once in every generation since that dark day three potentials are born. In this generation, Malory Price has been called, Dana Steele has been called, Zoe McCourt has been called. For three thousand years, the potentials have failed. But this time...this time...Dana Steele knew her part of the quest wouldn't be any easier than Malory's, but she has a lot of faith in her intelligence, and as a librarian, she has a whole library at her disposal for the research at which she excels. Well...until pride and persecution push her into quitting her job. But she can still figure out where her key is. Of course, it would be easier to concentrate if Jordan Hawke didn't keep getting in her way. Years ago she'd loved him with the passion of youth, but he destroyed that...destroyed her...when he left town. Now he's back, for however long that's going to last, and he's convinced he can help her - in fact, he's certain he's supposed to help her. Dana's certain they had the love of a lifetime, but that was a lifetime ago. Between searching for the second key and starting up her business with Malory and Zoe, Dana just doesn't have time for Jordan any more, no matter how much she still loves him.Jordan knows what he lost all those years ago, and he has no intention of losing it again. He was drawn into this quest before he'd consciously decided to return to Pleasant Valley and he's determined to see it through. When Kane ups the stakes and tries to take a bite out of him, he knows he's right. He'll defy an evil god and stand beside Dana to the end. Even if he has to rewrite history to do so.This second installment of Nora Roberts' The Key Trilogy hits a bit harder than the first, and without the necessary world building and exposition set up that came in the first book,Key of Light, Roberts hit the ground running here, providing broader and deeper character definition for both Dana and Jordan, and adding a lot of fun scenes for the rest of the cast, as well. It's obvious that the plot has been ratcheted up a notch and the danger is a bit more pointed, both of which increase the pressure and intensity, but there's also more room given to the emotional development and relationship here that was very pleasing.I always enjoy a lead character who is an author, and Roberts did that particularly well with Jordan. It lends a genuine feeling of authenticity to his character, most notably concerning his work and his passion for writing. It's possible that was straight fiction, of course, but it felt so natural and true that I can't help but guess that there were a few Roberts' truisms in his personality. So too Dana's character and her love of reading. As I happen to share what is, frankly, a reading obsession, I felt very comfortable and familiar with a character who seemed in many ways a kindred spirit. I truly liked them, as individuals and as romantic leads.As a general rule, it is usually the second book of a trilogy that I find most telling for the overall arc of the trilogy, and in this book, I saw a couple of glimmers of tarnish on the brass ring. Rules set in the first book seemed to break here, and characters didn't seem to be able to recognize simple patterns of Big Bad behavior that seemed a little obvious to me as a reader. Part of that was accounted for with the twisting and evolving mythos of the battle Kane is waging to keep those keys hidden, but I wasn't totally able to buy this sudden alteration after 3,000 years. It seemed a little too convenient when danger and threat needed to be raised in the plot. Still, that's strictly a plot issue and frankly, that's never been the strongest motivation for my reading these sorts of Roberts' trilogies.The characters consistently draw me, and the relationships are stellar here in this trilogy. I'm very fond of how everyone fits together, and enjoy their idiosyncrasies and foibles that make each of them so individual and real. I was heartened by the consistency of characterization in Malory and Flynn (though with Roberts as the author, character inconsistency is virtually unheard of), and charmed anew by the few scenes with Zoe and Brad. I can't wait to see their sparks ignite in the conclusion,Key of Valor. I'm enjoying this trilogy very much, despite a few small issues with the plot of the quest, and the characters are definitely making it a thoroughly entertaining trip.Reviewed for One Good Book Deserves Another."},{"Title":"Key of Knowledge (Key Trilogy 2)","review":"I stopped reading Nora Roberts' books several years ago as they began to seem redundant.

However, the characters in this trilogy are a rerun of her female characters in all of her other trilogies, ie: \\"The Born In\\"; \\"The Dream\\"; \\"Three Sisters Island\\" trilogy, etc. In the first of this triad \\"Key of Light\\" there is her level headed business oriented Malory. In \\"Key of Knowledge\\" the foul mouthed, brittle, macho Dana; and finally, in forthcoming \\"Key of Valor\\" Zoe, the uber female with an out of wedlock kid this time. All three women are introduced in the first book of this trilogy \\"Key of Light\\". The three males who bed and wed these women are reruns of the males found in the abovementioned trilogies as well.This time around the three damsels in distress are placed in a truly unbelievable situation of quasi magic interfacing with reality. This trilogy requires that the reader suspend rationality totally which one could if this were in the futuristic vein that she presents in her outstanding romance-thriller series written under her pen alterego name J.D.Robb. Those stories have a real edginess with her hip, tender-tough warrior-heroine Eve Dallas. I have a sense of Nora going a bit stale character wise in this Key series. Read them and judge for yourself."},{"Title":"Key of Knowledge (Key Trilogy 2)","review":"What can I say?

They sleep in glass coffins, beyond the Veil. Their souls are locked away in the Box of Souls, which can only be opened by three keys turned by human hands. In each generation three human women are born who have the means to find the three keys and end the curse. Each, in turn, has one moon phase to find a key. If the first fails, game over. If the first succeeds, the second woman takes up the quest, and so on. If any of the three mortal females fail, they each lose an undisclosed year of her life. If all three succeed, the demi-goddesses will awaken and each of the three human women will receive one million dollars.Malory succeeded in her quest. The first key has been found. The first lock has been opened on the Box of Souls. Dana Steele's quest begins. Dana's talent and quest is in knowledge, her love of books and information. This novel focuses on Dana's true love, Jordan. Jordan is a highly successful author of dark novels. Problem is that Jordan dumped Dana years ago and walked out of her life without looking back. Now that he is famous and returned, he seems to expect to just pick up with Dana where he left off. NOT! Worse, the entire time all is happening, the evil sorcerer, Kane, watches.**** Okay, not as good as the first, but still well worth a solid four stars! More time is spent on Dana and Jordan (as a couple) and the store &quot;Indulgence&quot; (that the women are putting together) than on the quest, itself.

During her turn at bat, she also reignites an old romance with author Jordan Hawke, and of course the two of them will live happily ever after when they move into the exotic castle once it has been vacated by the Celtic deities Rowena and Pitte.Speaking of Celtic deities, the characters in this book, who are engaged in conflict with one of the pagan gods, invoke the name of Jesus Christ A LOT. Yet it never occurs to any one of them to consult a Bible. If garlic and a cross can drive away vampires, why wouldn't a Bible provide the &quot;Key&quot; to defeating a pagan god.Christians might not enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Key of Knowledge (Key Trilogy 2)","review":"In Pleasant valley, Pennsylvania, three women were invited to attend a cocktail party hosted at a castle by people they never met before.

Each one will seek a special key that will open the locks that imprison Ninkane, Venora, and Kyna. Others have tried and failed as the God Kane is powerful, tricky, and willing to kill his antagonists.Last month Malory Price was first up and successfully found the KEY OF LIGHT.

She loved him once, but he left her without a look back. Jordan is willing die to keep his beloved safe. Kane is willing to accommodate Jordan, but killing Dana is an option.The key to a Nora Roberts novel is the believability of the characters who, regardless of the situation (even a fantasy setting), seem genuine. That is the case in KEY OF KNOWLEDGE as it was with its predecessor and guaranteed to occur with the conclusion (see KEY OF VALOR). The story line is exciting, but it is the prime players regardless of \\"species\\" that make this tale and the series a must delight for fans of romantic fantasy.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Key of Knowledge (Key Trilogy 2)","review":"The characters in this book were sooo predictable.

Her counterpart in the search for the second key is Jordan Hawke. Dana and Jordan have a long history. Jordan is Dana's brothers' best friend, so their relationship started out with friendship, but turned to love. He broke her heart when he abruptly left town after the death of his mother. Jordan has returned as a successful writer, but also with a history attached to Warriors Peak. He has always been fascinated with the old house, so much so that he based one of his best selling books on it.As Dana and Jordan search for the second key, it becomes apparent that they must resolve their past, and look into their future together if they are going to locate the second key. The evil foe Kane that was introduced in the first book, is playing dirty and deadly now."},{"Title":"Key of Knowledge (Key Trilogy 2)","review":"Maybe I just connected with Dana and Jordan because of their love for books, but I found their romance very realistic with mutual interests, a past history, and having to work through pain and misunderstanding to re-establish trust. Yes, Dana is very angry and that was sometimes off-putting, but anger often masks hurt, and Jordan had hurt her very deeply. Over the long haul, their banter worked for me.Although Dana sometimes seemed less intelligent or intuitive than one would think, it could easily have been the pressure that made things hard to see--that and her early antipathy for Jordan, whom I liked a great deal. I found her to be a more complex character than Mallory (Light) -- same for Jordan compared to Flynn.Although the dog got annoying (even in the first book) and the girl bonding was a bit overdone, the guys being guys made up for it. They were such fun to read about. This entry had the most humor to me. The finding of the key was, I thought, a unique take...much more a couple's thing than Mallory and Flynn."},{"Title":"Key of Knowledge (Key Trilogy 2)","review":"It has been quite sometime since I have enjoyed truly enjoyed one of Nora Roberts many many books.

Loved this book and I'm happy to recommed it!"},{"Title":"Key of Knowledge (Key Trilogy 2)","review":"Wow..as always, Nora Roberts blows me away with her writing and stories. This book was no exception. Be warned..it is the second book in the Key trilogy, so be sure and read the first one before attempting this novel. (key of light)The key of knowledge follows librarian Dana on her quest for the missing key that will unlock a magical box and free three celtic demi goddesses from their long prison of sleep. Joining her on her quest are Mallory and Zoe..her best friends, business partners, and fellow key searchers.Helping Dana is Jordan Hawke, a mystery writer who she has always loved but who broke her heart when she was younger. Jordan is determined to win her back, help her find her key and protect her from the evil god, Kane. Their relationship is complex--friends, ex-lovers, he is also her brother's best friend.This book expands on the story line introduced in the first book- Kane becomes more of an active evil force, Pitte and Rowena are better characterized, and it is nice to revisit with Mallory, Flynn, and Moe (from the first book). The book also gives us a glimpse of what's to come in the final book with Zoe and Brad's relationship.The second book was in my opinion, better than the first book- Dana is likable, complex, smart and her emotions are multi-layered. She is once again attracted to Jordan, but knows that could lead to another broken heart. She is at a crossroads in her life- having quit her steady job and taking a chance on opening her own business. She is also on a time limit to completing her part of the key quest.I love how Nora Roberts uses Celtic myths and magical elements to enhance the story. It is so well done that it is easy to suspend belief and really believe in the legends, gods, curses and evil.I can't wait to finish this trilogy and eagerly await Zoe and Brad's story...."},{"Title":"Key of Knowledge (Key Trilogy 2)","review":"Nora Roberts is to romance what Stephen King is to horror. Now of course, some of her books are better written than others, but she always has a good story to tell -- and Key of Knowledge is both well written and a good story. I'm not going to re-hash the plot of this book, it's already been done and done well. But I wanted to say that it is a great 2nd book in a trilogy. So often authors will suck you in with great concepts in the first book of a trilogy and then fail to deliver in the 2nd and 3rd books. (Most notably for Ms. Roberts is her Three Sisters Trilogy). But this second book rocks! It keeps up the energy of the first and even though it is a love story and we know how it's going to end -- she keeps up a level of suspense in the story itself. I can't wait to read the third book."},{"Title":"Key of Knowledge (Key Trilogy 2)","review":"This is the second book of the Key trilogy, a paranormal series in which three women are chosen to save three Celtic goddesses who are trapped by a curse. It's a competent and pleasant read, but suffers from several flaws. The main one is that the three heroines and three heroes (particularly the heroes) are interchangeable with the characters of many of Roberts' trilogies and quartets. Only halfway through the book it was already impossible to remember what any of them looked like, and their dialog is also indistinguishable. I found it jarring when one woman used language suitable for a college graduate when she was described as having very little formal education. The androgynous names don't help: Jordan and Dana, or Dane, are the H/H of this book. Even the most intimate scenes are almost boiler plate from other books. The trapped goddesses are not fully brought to life; Roberts tells us, but doesn't show us, that they are young, beautiful, talented and innocent. End of story. I found it difficult to care about them and regard them as mere place holders for the plot. The guardians of the situation are more interesting, but you don't see enough of them. The best part of the book was at the end, when Roberts created a highly ingenious situation that entangled Jordan and Dana. This is an easy read that won't exercise your brain or remain with you once you've finished it."},{"Title":"Key of Knowledge (Key Trilogy 2)","review":"It's amazing how, with a good author, you find yourself immediately intrigued by the heroine (or heroines). I like that there's magic in a story about grown-ups (!). I read this one quite quickly; it's one of those can't-put-it-down type books. Because I'm a bookworm and a half, I really found myself relating to this heroine even more than the first book. I really like how the resolution came about: quite a complex bit of magic, that.It's a fun setting, it's a fun idea, and, if you don't concentrate too hard on some of the \\"that's impossible to believe\\" aspects of it (three strangers immediately best friends who go into business together...), then you'll have a great time reading this one.

I got this book on the 25th and finished it yesterday morning. What a great story!Malory completed part 1 of the quest in Key of Light, and also found love with Flynn Hennessey. Part 2, Key of Knowledge, is the story of Dana (Flynn's step-sister). Malory, Dana, and Zoe each have to find a key, to free the souls of three Celtic goddesses who have been trapped by an evil sorcerer. It sounds silly, but Nora has a way of writing it and making it seem completely reasonable!Dana was in love with a writer named Jordan Hawke, but he broke her heart many years ago when he moved to New York City to make a name for himself as a Stephen King like writer. He's back in town though, and between the quest for the key and the sparks flying between Jordan and Dana (plus Malory, Dana and Zoe all starting their own business together), this book is packed with action on almost every page. I couldn't put it down once I started reading and now I'm pining away for book 3 (Key of Valor). I can't wait to see how it all ends, and read the story of Brad and Zoe!Nora's characters are, as always, sympathetic, intriguing, and fun to read. Her dialogue is always flowing and realistic, her men sexy and charming. I'm a huge fan of her books and style, and in this one she definitely doesn't disappoint. I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Key of Knowledge (Key Trilogy 2)","review":"Even though this is the 2nd book in the 'Key' trilogy,Key of Knowledgecan be easily read as a stand-alone because Dana, the heroine, gives a pretty good - and funny - recapitulation of what happened in the 1st book,Key of Light. That said, I still recommend reading this series in order, as you get a better understanding of how things work in this PNR realm created by NR.That certainly helped me to guess where the key Dana was assigned to find was hidden, because the pattern had already been established in the previous book. I had it all figured out pretty soon, and it was only Dana's stubbornness and blind eye about all things involving Jordan, the hero, that prevented her from getting it too. There was a twist in the end that shifted the pattern a bit, so it was nice to be surprised and see that not everything was predictable.As for the romantic part of the story, Dana and Jordan had good chemistry and I enjoyed reading their scenes together. Theirs was a \\"lovers-reunited\\" kind of story, and this plotline doesn't always work for me - I mean, if you couldn't make your relationship work the 1st time around, why rehash it? - but I think NR did a good job showing why their 1st time together wasn't meant to be and how they needed to go their separate ways - Jordan being the one who had left - before getting back together for good.As it happened inKey of Light, there's a lot of talk about symbolism, coincidences and fate in this book too. All interesting, but I confess my eyes started to glaze during some parts. Thankfully, those scenes were minor bumps in a story that, as a whole, flew quite smoothly."},{"Title":"Key of Knowledge (Key Trilogy 2)","review":"Key of KnowledgeKey of Valor (Key Trilogy, 3)I had purchased the first book of the trilogy at a library book sale and liked it so much that I wanted the other two which I was able to purchase at Amazon.

This book is read by a truly gifted person, Susan Eriksen, which makes the story all the more engaging. I have since sought out as many of Nora Roberts' books as I can find. I especially love trilogies when the characters are as endearing as are Ms. Roberts'. Trilogies allow the story to be told in its entirety, while allowing the reader/listener the opportunity to enjoy their company of some wonderful characters.This story, like many others by this author, describes the evolution of three women, destined to come together as sisters at heart, to find their strengths, and their personal power, natural and supernatural ... all with the romantic flavor one should expect from Ms. Roberts.I highly recommend the Key Trilogy, and for those that do not want the longer stories, any of her single books are equally enjoyable.

What's more, the editor disagrees with those who contend that sayings are supposed to \\"embody the values of the culture that uses them,\\" and proves the point by offering a variety of contradictory proverbs that are used by the same culture.

As is the case in many of his works, it is nautical in nature. However, unlike many of his nautical works, it is no coming of age story.End of the Tether should be viewed along with Dostoyevsky rather than Kipling. The story seems much more real than heroic. There is no great triumph. Rather, we see the weight of honor and duty further crushing a amiable, self made, gentleman who has already been dealt blows of devastation by disability, capitalism gone sour, and family needs.This is no happy go lucky story, or jolly romp. It is an honest look at a man and packs powerful emotions. This book spoke to me as few others have. It is amazing how Joseph Conrad has transcended the years and told the story of Gen X. The narrative may seem different; but the emotions of the story are the same.This book is a must read."},{"Title":"End of the Tether","review":"And I thought I WAS a die-hard Conrad fan! He's one of those writers by whom I must read a book every two or three years -- but this one I did not like at all. Despite the usual brilliant prose, much of it as good as anything Conrad has done, &quot;Tether&quot; is a let-down -- astoundingly depressing! Most Conrad work posits a world that is inimical and uncaring, yet holds out hope that courage and integrity will serve to help us endure it all; &quot;Tether&quot; holds out no such hope. It concerns a captain who continues to pilot his ship even though he is legally blind, doing so in order to provide for his family. Nothing turns out okay, and no one ends up happy.

Jager succinctly and brilliantly pulls together the dispersed and disparate strands of how a nation develops a modern conception of its identity. In the case of South Korea the focus is on the gendered aspect of that identity, which is not only rooted in tradition but also in new narrative conceptions of that tradition. By taking a long and broad view of the dispersed development of these parallel and gendered narratives of modern identity (long because Jager's account covers the whole of the 20th century, and broad because she delves into literature, politics, historiography, economic development, and monuments and museums), Jager is able to show why South Koreans are who they are today with the kind of social structure that comprises its modern nation. Although this book is invaluable in the insights it provides to South Korean national identity, the true value of the book lies in providing a new approach to the study of national identity that can be applied to just about any other modern nation. This book is a must for the specialist and the generalist, the particularist and the theorist, in all fields of the humanities and the social sciences."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"My only real gripe about this book is that it was too short. Because Ellis has such an ability to produce readable history books, I believe a 700-page book on Washington would have been more valuable and not been too bogged down in detail. In fact, there is so much about the American Revolution that is not discussed in this book. That was a bit disappointing.On the positive side, it's a very quick read and informative. I learned a great deal about Washington's temperament and his relative sensitivity to criticism, which surprised me. The book was naturally pro-Washington, not that anyone could really justify an anti-Washington stance. Ellis gives Washington perhaps too much credit for liberating his slaves in his will; Washington could have made a greater impact by freeing them while he was alive. Regardless, this is a great book for someone with minimal history background because it's short and easy to follow."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"I'm disappointed that some readers felt the author was too critical of Washington. I think Ellis made an honest effort to understand Washington, and I don't see how he was motivated by modern politics.Washington was a great man but he wasn't Christ. Hero-worshippers should stick to books about chopping down cherry trees and throwing dollars across the Potomac."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"I liked the very readable style the book is written in. It doesn't get bogged down on minute details but gives the readers an overall picture of Washington, with a heavy focus on his political life.I don't know if this is a result of the records or of the author, since this is my first biography on Washington, but I didn't get a good feel for who Washington was as a person. The book details his actions, but it doesn't let us into his motives and his passions."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"Given the size of the book and complexity of the subject matter, I had no real expectation of a detailed account of George Washington's life. My expectations were met; this book contains few details regarding George Washington's public life and even fewer details regarding his personal life, e.g., some decades of George Washington's life are covered in pages, not chapters. Because of the lack of details, George Washington will remain a stone bust to most readers, unless one believes a 275 page book that necessarily devotes a significant number of pages to surrounding circumstances and figures can resuscitate a human being of this stature. Or, perhaps George Washington will forever remain a stone bust because of George Washington's self-controlled nature and manipulation of his own imagine, as suggested by the author.Notwithstanding the lack of details contained in this book, it is a very well written, readable and entertaining book. Further, this would be a great book for anyone looking for a concise, entertaining book on George Washington."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"This is a superbly written book by Joseph Ellis (as usual) as well as a wonderful review of how this country became what it is. I would like to see this book as a basis for all school children to have as a course for an understanding of this era of our history. It would also serve as an outline to reach out to other historical events mentioned in the book."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"This book is even better than Ellis' \\"Founding Brothers.\\" It covers all the important issues in Washington's life without getting bogged down in tedious detail. The reader will come away with an enhanced appreciation with just how important Washington was to the success of the American experiment--militarily and as its first civilian leader.Ellis alludes to the interesting question of whether American history might have been different had Washington had a male heir. He is also quite candid in his handling of the slavery issue and Washington's mistakes that almost got his army destroyed on Manhattan Island in 1776, as well as his eagerness to hang a few soldiers every now and then to maintain military discipline (as well as poor Major Andre)."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"I am rapidly becoming a fan of Mr Ellis' biographies. Last year I thoroughly enjoyed his biography of Thomas Jefferson (\\"American Sphinx\\") and this introduction to George Washington is even better-written, better-balanced and more engrossing. I read it quickly partly because it's well-written, but mostly because the subject is so compelling. This is good stuff!It is also good to read both books to see the tensions that are inherent in any republic. In Jefferson, there is a strong tilt toward citizen democracy and limits on Government, while Washington (and Hamilton) saw the need for an organizing power in society. Too much of either is obviously a bad thing. Too little government can lead to chaos; too much leads to tyranny.Ellis' depiction of Washington's wisdom, his practical understanding of government and his unique refusal to succumb to the temptations of power (Napoleon in France, Lenin in Russia, Castro in Cuba all failed this test) make him a fascinating subject. As the uniquely central figure for over 30 years before, during and after the American Revolution, Washington is clearly \\"the\\" founding figure in our nation's history. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"Separating Washington the myth from Washington the living/breathing human has been the goal of many an author/historian. Few (if any) have approached that lofty goal...that is until noted historian Joseph Ellis published this marvelous work covering both Washington's life and idealism. Comprising a surprisingly succinct amount of information into such a relatively small work (about 275 pages), Ellis provides a welcome alternative to the many-volumed biographical works from Freeman and Flexnar and broadens history's view of this atypical founding father.Relying on many scholarly sources, but primarily presenting an interpretation of the \\"Washington Papers\\", Ellis pens a full and rich version of Washington's life. Chronologically and politically, Ellis's version differs slightly from the standing myth...indeed, he delves into the mind of Washington moreso than any other biographer and this interpretation gives a fresh view of the many oft-told stories of the founding of this nation. Washington's actions prior to and during the French and Indian War are covered in a comprehensive nature while still leaning heavily toward the personal side. His realization of and subsequent support of the fledgling nations revolutionary ideals fits well into Ellis's \\"wheelhouse\\"...revolutionary idealism is clearly Ellis's strength and his interpretation of Washington's thoughts at this point provides a nice segue into the subsequent war.The Revolutionary War is covered obviously in the context of Washington's involvement, but the thinking and planning deep in his mind as he realizes that an agressive strategy would mean certain defeat offsets the standard thinking about the War. Anxiety concerning the French participation is palpable, as is the subsequent joy and satisfaction at having finally cornered and defeated the British at Yorktown. It's this internalized view from Washington's perspective at the end of the War that sets the stage for the rest of the book and let's us understand his need for a certain lifestyle after the War.Unfortunately for him (fortunately for us!) he can't escape the idealogical conflict as the Constitution is drafted and finalized and his role as President becomes defined. Reluctantly taking office, he becomes largley a delegator, becoming involved only in issues that subordinates cannot finalize...the apex of that being the Jay treaty that avoids (delays?) war with the British, but alienates him politically. Ellis masterfully balances Washington's thinking with the isolationist tendencies of the other pantheons of American history, Thomas Jefferson and James Madison. In fact, the highlight of this work (in my view) is the deteriorating relationship between Jefferson and Washington and how this split ultimately leads to the initial formation of the political party system.A scholarly work that historians and general readers should savor and appreciate, \\"His Excellency\\" adds greatly to the recent thrust of Revolutionary literature and furthers Joseph Ellis's reputation as a neo-revisionist historian. Well written and researched, this work surely will become essential reading for all Washington scholars...enjoy."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"Prior to reading His Excellency, George Washington was a mystery to me. Although by reflex I considered him \\"The Father of Our Country\\", there was no depth to him in my education and he was more of a clich&eacute; of childhood stories in my mind. Other founding fathers such as Benjamin Franklin, John Adams, and Thomas Jefferson have been the beneficiaries of recent adulation while Washington has assumed the role of the stodgy, unimaginative man on top. To make things worse, the stain of slave ownership has become a yoke on his reputation in recent years and has tied him closer to Jefferson Davis than the preceding founding fathers. This book gives Washington's reputation a boost as it tells the life story of an ambitious young man who makes the most of his prospects to rise to a position of high status and leadership in the Colonies and later the United States. Ellis portrays Washington as a man of great depth and character, fair but tough, who coupled his own aspirations of wealth and status with the higher calling of building a new, truly revolutionary nation. For me the most striking lesson I got from the book is that rather than being a precursor of the Confederacy, Washington was a dedicated Unionist who worked toward a strong Federal government to unify thirteen States into one nation. Unlike historical figures such as Napoleon, Julius Caesar, and Mao, Washington did the \\"right thing\\" when confronted with the siren song of monarchial power, thus setting a key cornerstone in our democratic traditions."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"A fine biography by a fine writer.

It's in the line up once more. Mr. Ellis is one of the most outstanding authors of our time. His book on our Greatest President makes His Excellency a man above all others in the American experience. Without Ellis, most of us would be in the dark. Without Washington, there would be no America."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"George Washington possessed the gift of silence, according to his VP Adams (and a good thing that was, as Adams did not possess it at all.) Considering all the partisan noise and turbulence during the constitutional debate and the first presidency, that gift of silence may have been what saved the new republic from early shipwreck.For his earlier years, another key ability of his was more important: survival. If you want to succeed, you have to survive first. In GW's own view of his lucky escape over many years in two wars, he was a beneficiary of providential forces. It seems that was about as religious as he would get.Ellis defines his purpose in writing this short Washington bio like this: how did it come about that GW is considered the \`Foundingest Father of them all'?Among the writing on GW, there are two frequent extremes: the hero worshippers and those of the \`Oedipal' direction, the father murderers. Ellis intended to stay away from both, and I think he managed to do that.For the purpose of writing this book, Ellis read single-handedly the whole series of Washington Papers. Awesome. There are over 40 volumes of those.In the early chapters, Ellis is not trying very hard to avoid stepping on the fan club's toes. GW's emerging personality is characterized by two not very endearing traits: first, a thin-skinned aversion to criticism, and second, a capacity to play the political game effectively while cultivating the claim of not being interested in it. I have looked up some of the 1 star reviews here, and found that Washington worshippers don't appreciate this critical attitude towards their idol. Furthermore, an allegation that GW had a love affair with the wife of a friend is not accepted happily by some. Watched from afar, in time and space, I wonder: so what? Why does it matter? Answer: true admiration needs purity in its object. (On the other hand, a rational mind wants to know the real man, not the saint.)From the chapter about the squire time in Virginia, between the British war against France and her Indian allies, and later the War of Independence, we take away this key message: the man was aware of economics and business management needs. He understood what it meant to be exploited by the colonial master. His revolutionary impulses were fanned by genuine self interest.On the military leader of the revolutionary war, Ellis has to say that GW lost more battles than any other victorious general in modern times. GW's own judgment at taking the charge was that he was not qualified for the task. Ellis agrees. Why did GW win then? First, he was lucky with his overly cautious adversaries, who didn't pursue their advantage as relentlessly as they might have. Though everyone expected a short war at the start, the Americans would surely have lost a short war. Second, the leader's personal qualities helped: he was composed, indefatigable, and able to learn from mistakes.Ellis then challenges the assumption that time was on America's side. Wasn't the British war machine far better able to finance and maintain an army? Washington's ragtag Continental army gave little reason for optimism. Undermanned, undersupplied, underfunded and undertrained... Why did they win at all?Ellis quotes a picture that somebody else invented: the American victory was like that of an outclassed boxer who miraculously knocks out the stronger opponent in the last round.New to me: when many expected GW to make use of his victory for grabbing power in the new continental \`empire', he proved \`as immune to the seduction of dictatorial power as he had been to small pox'. I learned that he actually resisted a military coup that would have made him America's Napoleon (or rather, that would have turned Napoleon into France's Washington).During the interlude between generalship and presidency, which GW initially mistook for retirement, he gets dragged into the constitutional debate, but stays artfully aloof and thus can't avoid the first presidency.The presidency was a true first: the first republic in a new state. A nation is built out of chaos. Did GW take the helm or did he just man the bridge? That depends on the subjects. Some subjects were delegated, like treasury to Hamilton. Some issues GW took on himself. Some key issues were not tackled at all, like slavery (out of fear of the outcome), or were not successfully tackled (like GW's wish for a fair Indian solution). The second presidency term came up mainly because the president's surrogate sons started fighting: Jefferson (& Madison) versus Hamilton. Though he held things together, there seems to be no doubt that GW stood on Hamilton's side in the federalism question.The political game became dirty. Parties were born. Trust was betrayed. Jefferson and Hamilton both turned out to be villains. The Republicans started Fox News, then called Aurora, with the task to smear and slander Washington and his policy of nation building.They started the predecessor of the Tea Party, then called French Party, in opposition to Washington's neutrality policy in the war between Britain and France.Not having grown up with these subjects, I don't know how original the book is. For me it was certainly very interesting, and it puts the noises that I hear out of the contemporary US in a different light. There is nothing new under the sun, alas."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"My thoughts on this book are two-fold. First, I enjoyed reading it. Joseph Ellis is an erudite scholar which, while giving his book a thesis paper feel, does not hurt the overall effect of readability by the public. His command of English vocabulary is truly exceptional and though he assumes a lecturing tone at times, I could really tell the genuine interest for his subject behind it. For instance, Ellis' reason for choosing to write a book on George Washington is masterly. \\"It seemed to me that Benjamin Franklin was wiser than Washington; Alexander Hamilton was more brilliant; John Adams was better read; Thomas Jefferson was more intellectually sophisticated; James Madison was more politically astute. Yet each and all of these prominent figures acknowledged that Washington was their unquestioned superior. Within the gallery of greats so often mythologized and capitalized as Founding Fathers, Washington was recognized as primus inter pares, the Foundingest Father of them all. Why was that? In the pages that follow I have looked for an answer, which lies buried within the folds of the most ambitious, determined, and potent personality of an age not lacking for worthy rivals. How he became that way, and what he then did with it, is the story I try to tell\\" (p. xiv). I did not sense a definitive bias from Joseph Ellis regarding Washington. He lets Washington speak for himself, little though he does that, even when the motives are less than altruistic or just plain contradicting. The number of direct sources from Washington probably proved frustrating but Ellis works deftly around this gap by using copious sources from various contemporary peers of Washington and the research that has been done since.Secondly, I still have a hard time picturing George Washington, the man. Although I really believe that this is not the fault of the author but due mainly to the scanty surviving sources written by Washington himself. Washington, apparently, always had a view towards the future and his place in posterity and thus limited what he put in writing. Also he directed Martha to burn all their personal correspondence after his death--which she complied with. I really feel that being able to read the letters between him and his wife would have shed a more humane light on the Father of Our Nation. All that being said I have learned a new respect for George Washington and that immense impact that he had on the birth of our nation. Even if he wasn't the smartest or the most intellectual or best dresser, Washington had something indefinable, something that allowed all the men around him to trust him implicitly. And I feel so blessed to have a man like this around when we so desperately needed him."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"...make sure it's this one.I'm simply amazed by this work. I've enjoyed it and understood so much, it's truly surprising. It's an easy read. And I can tell you the level of information that is profound and insightful is outstanding. I live in New York City, and received this from a stranger who was rummaging thru an entire library of books on the streetside on the Upper East Side. He offered me several books, including one by Obama, which I was about to take. Until I saw this book...I figured why not read about someone who already has a legacy rather than someone who wrote this book while still aspiring to one. I've done light reading on some of the War for Independence since some major events of that time occured withing a few hundred miles or less from here. Far from being a simple world, you're able to see what swirling circumstances surrounded both the birth of America and the advent of it's greatest Founding Father. As a military officer, I was blown away to read that Washington had been at the start of the French and Indian War, and had been party to war crimes. Such things drive a more human portrait of the man. And you wonder, would he have survived the scrutiny and conscience of today's world? He was surely a great man in an amazing time. But having read this book, I can say so with utter confidence rather than a vague understanding which is more notional than substantial. So compelling. What's amazing is how much more about America you will understand. I'm astounded by how much 'American' ideas that took shape in his time are still prevalent and alive today. For these reasons, this book and this nation are truly special."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"Washington has always seemed somehow inaccessible to me, like an Olympian who rules from the mountain rather than a rough and tumble pol. We Americans have been brought up on so many ridiculous myths, such as the chopped-cherrie-tree-cannot-tell-a-lie story to the neutral presider over the innumerable factions of bickering revolutionaries. While I had read bios of virtually all of his founder contemporaries, I never felt I could penetrate the cloud around him.Then I discovered this masterful book. Not only does it follow his career, but it informs the reader as to Washington's motivations, emotional life, and methods - he was passionate, ambitious, coldly shrewd, and stringently self-disciplined. (In contrast to his popular image, he had a fiery temper that he learned to keep in check with great difficulty.) In each step of his life, he learned certain lessons from experience rather than books, shaping his attitudes in his own way. Though born to a plantation family, he was relatively underprivileged (i.e. not the prime heir) and so had to make his way more or less on his own; he had little formal education. First, he found a military career under the British. While he learned a great deal about how to fight on American soil - with different requirements than EUropean theatres - he came to despise aristocratic privilege, which all too often reserved position and advantage to the mediocre and undeserving.Second, after a tumultuous career beginning - he oversaw a massacre by Indian allies that led indirectly to the Seven Years War and was a key player in many significant defeats - he benefitted from his reputation to make a crucially important marriage to the widow Martha, enabling himself to become a gentleman farmer for 16 years, at the pinnacle of Virginia gentry. However, while maintaining a properly pseudo-aristocratic life style with extremely expensive European goods, he proved to be an innovative business man, with real estate deals and experiments in the management of his estates; because he came to distrust faraway officials dispensing favors and merchants who enmeshed his neighbors in inescapable debt, he moved away from mono-crops such as tobacco whose markets were unpredictable towards self sustainability. This created a streak of fierce independence and self-reliance within him and, alone among the founding fathers, he died a very rich man with minimal debt. When the time came for the revolution, he was ready to risk everything to preserve his political and economic autonomy.Third, he took over the motley and poorly funded American rebel forces and led them to victory in spite of his early catastrophic defeat in New York, where he concluded that he would have to harass the British to gradually wear them down rather than confront them directly in the field. This long conflict forced him to contend with the incompetent confederation government, which convinced him of the need for a strong executive that had the power to tax and act effectively. As such, this explains very clearly why he sided with the Federalists later. Once again, this was counterintuitive to conventional wisdom: the colonies had revolted against the British monarchies policies and taxation.Fourth, we see the politician emerge at the start of the Constitutional Convention. Washington retired with unsurpassed prestige, so his participation might ruin his reputation as the country's liberator. He waited a long time to commit himself, weighing his options and getting up to speed on the political vocabulary through tutorials with Madison - while he had some idea of what he wanted to do from his experience as a leader and executive, he relied on his more learned colleagues for the right way to describe and sell it.Fifth, as president, Washington not only established many of the norms of executive power and practice that have survived intact to the present day, but also attempted to manipulate the political forces to prevent the country from fragmenting into competing adversarial powers. Of course, in hindsight, we know that he failed to forge a durable union by the middle of the 19C, that the issue of slavery (and the economic system it supported) had to be reckoned with later, though the delay of a few generations may have been enough to keep the union from immediate and permanent disintegration. Nonetheless, Washington essentially created the federal system of government, with its ability to raise funds, maintain an army, take precedence over states' prerogatives, and serve as a decisive economic actor (all of which is still controversial). Here, Hamilton was his indispensable instrument of action - but it was Washington who was the real mastermind. To paraphrase, he attempted to make the United States a singular noun rather than plural. Ellis convincingly portrays the immensity of this undertaking, as the first republic to rule over such a huge and socially disparate country.Ellis' book is quite brief, so I feared it would be superficial, such as Anthony Everitt's mediocre treatments of Roman pols. Fortunately, Ellis pulls it off with wonderful depth: the book has a density that can only come from a master historian and writer. I implicitly trusted his analyses at every turn and never found his statements glib or tendentious. He is critical of Washington, never makes excuses for his faults, but respectful.Warmly recommended. This is a great introduction to an extremely complex man."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"Joseph J Ellis's biography of George Washington is certianly not the best biography I've read on the man- but it is a great story. Ellis set out to tell us the life of a man he has grown up with and it was a very good success.The biography itself is very pacing, filled with detail, and told with charisma worthy of Washington himself. It was filled with new, educational facts about the man-I for one never knew that Washington had land in the West Country or that he saw the Potomac River as a trading gateway to the west.But I have my disappointments. The Revolutionary War is not heavly wrote about-perhaps 30 of the 275 pages are dedicated to the war. Second, I don't think Washington's achievements as President are talked about enough-Ellis focuses more on the conflict between Alexander Hamilitan and Thomas Jefferson. It is important but not enough top devote half of the chapters on the presidency on.I found the subject of religion and in particular Washington's religion as just 'bad'. Ellis said that Washington was not a very religious man. That is wrong.

Mr. Ellis was able to convey this story of this great man in such an enjoyable way that it should be required reading for entry level American History courses."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"Joseph Ellis, in his prior book Founding Brothers, and with this book has put on a demonstration of what it means to write about historical events with the touch of a novelists. These two books are works of nonfiction; however, Ellis presents his subject in such a way, in this case of Washington, as best can know from all available sources, primary and secondary. Some might think to lump Ellis in with other batches of \\"popular\\" or \\"current\\" history and write his works off. This would be unfair. Where some popular history writers create hagiographies to their subjects, Ellis, created a full picture, warts and all, of Washington. Plus, the facts he gathers, the logical arguments he makes, and the historical scenes he is able to recreate, at least in the sense of the drama, all make this and other Ellis books worth the read.I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"\\"Benjamin Franklin was wiser than Washington; Alexander Hamilton was more brilliant; John Adams was better read; Thomas Jefferson was more intellectually sophisticated; James Madison was more politically astute. Yet each and all of these prominent figures acknowledged that Washington was their unquestioned superior.\\" (pg xiv) And in this \\"modest-sized book about a massive historical subject,\\" Joseph Ellis looks at why Washington was so highly regarded, both by his contemporaries and by history.Ellis astutely points out that many others (such as Cromwell, Napoleon, Lenin, Mao, and Castro) were pivotal in orchestrating successful revolutions but only Washington declined to assume power in a military dictatorship (pg 139). And perhaps Washington's greatest trait was understanding that stepping aside would enhance the way he was viewed by posterity far greater than simply assuming power. He was always ambitious, looking for ways to integrate himself into Virginia society as a younger man, but he also knew when to exercise restraint and keep himself above the fray.As the key figure of the American Revolution he kept up the struggle even when all odds were against him - flagging support among the populace, poor condition of the Continental Army, lack of support from Congress, the supremacy of British strategy and control of the seas, French reluctance to provide assistance. And yet such experience taught him the importance of a strong federal government and guided his role as President of the new nation. There were no prior examples to draw from or precedent to follow, and although his own lack of a formal education was a constant embarrassment to him, he intuitively knew how to utilize the strengths of others and manage the competing ambitions of those around him in setting the nation on a path to stability.Ellis hasn't exactly written a biography in the classic sense, although he does chronicle Washington's life, but it's enhanced by a deep character study of this important man. And few are as adept at bringing history's characters to life in such an insightful way and putting the reader into their shoes. It was in strong contrast to John Ferling'sThe Ascent of George Washington. Where Ferling looks at a events with a critical eye enhanced with 200 years of historical hindsight, Ellis sees beyond the failings to the motivations and greater social customs of the day and makes the history personal in a way no one else does. Although the book was a little slow starting it was so packed with valuable insight that it merits a close reading. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"I have to admit I never really thought that much about George Washington. I knew who he was of course, (What American school child doesn't?), but I never really thought that much about him. I always gave him the respect due him; he was the father of my country after all. As a history buff, I knew of his many accomplishments that were impressive; Commander-In-Chief of a winning effort in the Revolutionary War, presiding over the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia, and of course the first President of the United States. Nevertheless, despite my immense interest in history, especially presidential history, he had never held my interest.Washington, like a lot of other Americans that I had learned about in my early years such as Lincoln, FDR, Susan B. Anthony, or Martin Luther King, Jr.; was too damn perfect to be interesting. He was too good and too honest. The image was of cherry-tree cutting boy scout who could not tell a lie*. In his preface, Ellis describes similar experiences calling Washington the \`man on the moon.' Personally, whenever someone asked who my favorite president was I would throw him or her a curve ball and say \`James K. Polk'**.Joseph Ellis's story begins with a young George Washington starting to make his mark in the French and Indian War, carrying a message from the Governor of Virginia to the Indian leader known as the Half-King. What is most interesting aspect about Ellis' take on George Washington it that Ellis makes it clear that there are two George Washingtons. There is the George Washington the man whom he truly was, and there is the iconic George Washington of whom the public sees and knows. I am not talking about Washington the famous historical figure in comparison to the real person. I am referring to something that was very real during his life and something that of which he himself was consciously aware. It would start with his published Journal of Major George Washington and continue into his brief post-presidential years. It is important one understands that in order to understand him.The real Washington was a man who often sought to better his position in society, but consequently he often felt out of place, an imposter in his position who is afraid he might be discovered. Although his family was wealthy, he was not a natural member of the Virginia gentry and as he moved into that role, thanks in no small part to the marriage to the widow Martha Curtis, he never felt quite at home in that position. He would engage in activities that were generally considered ungentlemanly. For example, Washington would always take an active interest in his money and investments, activity considered quite beneath a gentleman***.Washington also lacked a classical education; he gained most of his knowledge from real world experience. This however, also caused him to feel inferior and tended not to participate openly in debates, rather in his legislative career he would be more of a behind the scenes type of operator.\\"Washington was accustomed to leading by listening. During the Revolution, he had chaired countless councils of war in which junior officers presented options to the commander in chief. Before the war, George Mason had helped him understand the constitutional arguments against parliamentary taxation. In 1787, as in these previous instances, he already possessed a firm grasp of the elemental forces at work and a clear set of convictions about the strategic direction in which to lead those forces. Where he needed assistance---and he was completely comfortable about requesting and receiving it---was in mastering the vocabulary that more formally educated colleagues possessed, learning the intellectual road map to reach the destination that he had already decided upon.\\" p.175-6In battle, George Washington became known as the American Fabius. It was a role he did not care for but assumed out of necessity. He was hired because of his outstanding reputation from the French and Indian War, but often felt overwhelmed trying to lead a rag tag army of farm boys against the best-equipped and trained army in the world. However, Washington prevailed decisively at Yorktown. Even with that famous victory, Ellis points out, Washington was still unsatisfied and he did not quite think of the British as being truly beat.\\"Never a man to place his fate in trust, he had learned to mistrust everything emanating from London. Even the term \`negotiations' troubled him. What was there to negotiate? The British had tried to destroy him and his army, but he had destroyed them. He wanted the personal satisfaction that came with an unqualified, unconditional surrender. He wanted them to say that they had lost and he had won. He wanted his vaunted superiors to admit that they were his inferiors.\\" p. 138Later as President, Washington would use his public persona to help create a unified nation. Ellis shows that Washington was very much an American nationalist who favored a strong national government, but being aware of the need for a unifying leader he often would silence his voice and allow the others to debate the point. This would not satisfy Thomas Jefferson who felt like he always lost out to Alexander Hamilton when push came to shove. However, it was not Hamilton who controlled Washington, rather Washington just agreed with Hamilton on about everything and that made Jefferson the nonconformist.President Washington's view was that the presidency had to apolitical was a rather foolish thing because it obviously could not. During the President's second term, he became far more openly Federalist in his political appointments. This, ironically enough, is the exact same mistake King George III made in his view of the monarchy, and his real preference for the Tory party. (Although this is my personnel observation, not Ellis'. Also it is view neither President Washington nor King George III would have care for.)One of the biggest issues in early America is the issue of slavery. George Washington first became a slave owner when his father died, while George was only eleven. (This boggles the modern mind. Imagine going up to a prepubescent kid and informing him that he is now the \`owner' of a small group of people.) Ellis chronicles Washington's ever-evolving views on the subject, starting during the Revolution and continuing thought his life. Ellis holds the reason for Washington's changing ideas about the subject is combination of ideological and economic forces at work at the same time. The most interesting thing I found was that Washington's famous will in which he manumits his slaves is that will was actually Washington's back-up plan. His original idea was to sell off land that he owned out west to pay for the cost of manumission. He came up with this plan as early as 1794 but the fall of land prices had delayed implantation, so the will was written in case Washington, who was already a decade older than most the men in his family generally lived to, did not live see it through.Finally, one of the main themes in Ellis's book was; what made George Washington great is not what he did but rather what he did not do. Washington voluntarily walked away from power, not only once but twice. Although the peaceful transfer of power may seem normal for Americans, the idea that a revolutionary military leader would do that is incredible. Unlike Julius Caesar, Oliver Cromwell, Napoleon Bonaparte, and Vladimir Lenin, Washington would step aside where absolute power was available and let the Republic run its course. This was not always easy because he was not always happy with what occurred but Washington would not commit a sin against freedom and proclaim himself king.I would highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to know anything about our nation's primary founding father. This book is rich and covers a broad range of subjects in the life of Washington; only some of which have been discussed here. This book can be read and enjoyed from the advanced history buff to the historical novice, and they will find the second half of the eighteenth century come to life with the \`His Excellency.'* A ridiculous story if there ever was one.** I still like Polk, but that is for another article.*** Ellis points out it was for this reason Washington died rich and Jefferson died poor."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"All of us grew with the myths built around our Founding Fathers, especially of George Washington. Yet who is the man and what did he believe in and stand for? Ellis does a wonderful job in not only explaining the myths but in also showing the real Washington. The real farmer, land owner, officer, rebel and, eventually, President.I feel I've finally read a well balanced account of our first President. Ellis starts with the earliest known times of Washington, mostly about his interaction with the French and Indians that ultimately were the first shots of the French and Indian War. Throughout Ellis's bio we are shown the man as he lived and breathed, his thoughts and inclinations, his aura and power that he had over others. Although a bit short and perhaps could have been in more detail in some places, I couldn't help be fascinated with Washington the man, and not the man of myth. Ellis has done Washington justice and left us with a well balanced bio. A definite recommend.5 stars."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"When I decided to embark on a presidential biography reading journey, I decided to start with numero uno. The thing is, in less than 250 pages, you get the \\"George Washington for Dummies\\" version. It's a well written book. Mr. Ellis cannot be described as a poor author, but I wish he had written this book for the more hardcore biography and history buff. There was very little written about the relationship between President Washington and his wife, very little on the tense environment in the cabinet etc. Put it this way, I'm waiting for Chernow's Washington biography to come out in October for I feel that I cannot continue reading all the biographies without having a more solid read on George Washington.

The information continous to enhance my understanding of George Washington and the time of the revolutionary war. I would recommend this book to others."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"George Washington has always been a mystery to me. We call him the father of our country. We know that he was an important person in the founding of our nation. But we don't really know who he was.In my life I have read quotes attributed to Washington, here and there, and I started to realize that he was a very wise man. Joseph Ellis has removed all doubt about Washington's giant personality and his enormous importance in the successful birthing of our great nation. He revealed a man who was totally aware of his place in history and who looked to the future with prophetic vision. Ellis is an amazing writer. This is the first of his books that I have read but it will not be the last. I'm sure I will read this one again. If you love history you need to read this book. It really is a story about the beginning of our history as Americans."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"This book was a bit different from what I expected when I received it as a gift. I enjoy reading American history, and thought this would be a historical examination of the Washington years, i.e. the Revolutionary War and his two terms in office. While it did obviously cover those events, it was far less of a history book and much more a biography. Indeed, some key historical events like the battles at Lexington and Concord are barely mentioned, and then only to provide some historical context for the biographical discussion. In other words, this is a high level view of America in the second half of 18th century, with Washington at the center and other people or events coming into focus only as necessary to shed light on his actions and attitudes.The great value of this book is to offer the reader a deeper look into the character of a person who has been elevated nearly to demigod status in the minds of so many Americans. The author takes us past the Adonis-like sculpture that so many of us have seen in the Smithsonian, and into the mind of this singular figure whose importance to the birth of the country is both undeniable and somewhat accidental. We get to take a warts-and-all look at the real Washington, with his intriguing blend of ambition, ego, self-interest, commitment, service and resolve. On one hand is the aristrocratic, slave-owning squire obsessively amassing an ever larger personal estate. On the other is the revolutionary leader willing to put that life on hold for years on end and endure severe hardship to advance the greater common good. From ambitious young soldier, to marginally competent general, to stateman and president, and finally to the retired gentleman manipulated by the scheming Hamilton, Washington's successes and failures are treated with equal fairness by the author.Particularly intriguing was the insight into Washington's growing internal conflict between his idealism -- the realization that slavery was inconsistent with his revolutionary principles -- and his intense realism and pragmatism -- the knowledge that immediate action toward emancipation was not practical either for the country or his personal affairs. His willingness to compromise on the issue for the sake of holding the country together during its formative years is understandable as we consider Washington the statesman. His vacillation at the personal level, particularly the moral inconsistencies on the slavery issue -- his willingness to own slaves to secure his financial interests, while feeling a moral revulsion to selling them -- give us a look at the internal struggles of Washington the private man. Much has been said by historians about his decision to free his slaves in his will, but the intellectual and moral gyrations that led him to that point tell us much more about Washington than that final act.Overall I was very pleased with the insights offered in this volume, and found it a very enjoyable and quick read. I would recommend it for anyone who wants to get an unvarnished look at the real Washington. A great man? Definitely. But this book reminds us that in the final analysis, he was just a man at a unique place and time in history, and he played his role well."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"This book does an excellent job of showing the very human side of George Washington. There are some parts that offer unnecessarily-detailed descriptions of surrounding events. However, for the most part it is a very helpful synthesis 1000s of pages of information that shed light on his personality and overall life story. I definitely recommend it! Washington's God is another wonderful book on George Washington."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"The following comments are for the unabridged CD audio book version of His Excellency George Washington by Joseph Ellis and narrated by Nelson Runger.The audio book consists of 13 CD's and runs about 15 hours. Each CD is indexed into numbered tracks of 3 to 4 minuet lengths. The audio quality is uniformly excellent as had been my experiences with \\"Recorded Books\\" audio CD's. This listener found the narrator, Mr. Runger, an excellent speaker who clears pronunciation and moderate pacing a pleasure to listen too. Mr. Runger assumes a distinctive \\"voice\\" when reading direct quotes from Washington and other key players. I found these \`voices\\" complemented the listening experience; although a less skilled narrator employing that technique could be very distracting.I have recently completed my 2nd listening of this audio book. After my first listening session was completed I was motivated to seek out other books detailing certain aspects of Washington's life particularly his experiences in the French and Indian War.Concerning the story told by Mr. Ellis I can only say it is a masterful rendering of the life of Washington and highly recommended."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"Joseph Ellis' one-volume biography of George Washington is an excellent piece of history and biography. Ellis not only tells the story of Washington, he explains it and analyzes Washington's life. Ellis is certainly an admirer of all that Washington accomplished, but he is also critical at times of both Washington and the legend that surrounds him.Ellis tells this story in a matter-of-fact, conversational tone. The book is a thorough recount of Washington's life but does not get bogged down in the mundane details. At times, Ellis uses the minor details of Washington's life - such as his finances and yearly merchandise orders from London - to add life to both Washington and the life of all Virginia planters, but these are welcome glimpses into his life that do not detract from Ellis' story about the heroic life of Washington.Ellis successfully portrays Washington as a great man and truly worthy of his place as the father of America. However, Ellis does not gloss over Washington's flaws: his obsession with his own legacy, his hypocrisy on slavery, and his military mistakes (especially early in his career). This is an excellent biography that anyone with any interest in American history should read."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"Ellis is a great author, and he did a good job of giving us a nice overview of Washington's life and accomplishments. Unfortunately, Ellis made it his mission to \\"dispel the myths\\" surrounding Washington and prove he is a mere mortal after all. I have no problem accepting the fact that Washington was human, but I was disturbed by Ellis' attack on his character. Every noble accomplishment that Ellis chronicled was followed by a negative attack on Washington. I think it unfair to say that Washington was more interested in own reputation than the good of the nation.Washington's life speaks volumes for the kind of man he was, and the belief he had in a great United States of America. It will take a lot more than a misguided author to change that."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"Of all the books on Washington I have read, this book is decidedly different. It is very intellectual, it is constantly trying to prove a point. Yes, Ellis covers all the important events in Washington's life, but the writing here is focused on synthesis, distillation, and interpretation.Ellis points out many themes that recur, such as Washington's \\"volcano-like\\" temper that took an iron-like will to control, his fallibility, his oversized ego, the characteristics that lead to him being idolized, and his ever-present awareness that everything he did would be analyzed and criticized for ages to come.Ellis gives the reader a feeling for who Washington was in reality and why he was important, not an easy assignment because the facts concerning him have been incredibly distorted through the ages. I've read quite a bit on early American history at this point, so I can't say that, for me, there was much new information in the book. It's just that through his exhaustive research and excellent selection of primary source material for quotes, Ellis imparts a deep and basic understanding of Washington that makes understanding everything Washington did in the context of the world around him make more sense.The writing style itself is at all times very entertaining and lively. Instead of a dry \\"scholarly\\" analysis, Ellis offers us his impressions, including only enough quotes to let you know that he has the proof. Unfortunately, Washington's writings themselves are extremely stilted and tedious to read. No one besides a professional historian would have the patience or time to read much of Washington's written material him or herself.In a way, though this book is appropriate for someone who is reading about Washington for the first time, you may appreciate this book even more if you have already obtained some familiarity with the material. Flexner's \\"Washington: The indispensable Man\\" is an excellent, readable, comprehensive, and matter-of-fact biography of Washington (see my review in Amazon). Ellis's book is the opposite, taking stands on most matters, arguing, focusing on ideas and recurrent themes.Six stars would be more like it! Good job!!"},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"What makes Ellis' work so interesting is that he spends very little time focused on Washington's personal life, such as his love of the married Sally Fairfax or his marriage to the wealthy widow, Martha Dandridge Custis. Neither does Ellis spend much time addressing Washington's childhood; his main focus is on Washington as Commander of the Continental Army and as the first President of our country. While the length of the book compared with other biographies is relatively short, I felt that one should possess a good understanding of the events and key players surrounding the time of the Revolutionary War and the formation of our government before reading Ellis' book. What I appreciated most about his work is that he took Washington from a nearly mythological, untouchable character to an approachable man with a very distinct personality and characteristics. However, in omitting many of the personal and intimate details of Washington's life, Ellis still left much to be desired in learning about the man George Washington was. I completed this book with conflicting feelings, ironically reflective of Washington as the man of many contradictions. First, with a sense of sadness for Washington who often faced criticism and ridicule throughout his career by many of his own contemporaries, despite unselfishly answering the call in serving his country. Lastly, and most importantly, I completed this book feeling a great sense of respect for the sacrifice, prudence and judgment of the man who was \\"first in war, first in peace, and first in the hearts of his countrymen.\\""},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"Joseph Ellis has done a wonderful job giving real life to the man who won American independence in the Revolutionary War and who then went on to invent and sustain America's emerging nationhood. George Washington's early years on the Virginia frontier, to his role in the French and Indian War are fascinating enough. However, this early part of the book (and his life) serve to illustrate the crucible that these early days were to the creation of his iron will and the leadership qualities that brought him to lead the Continental Army throughout the Revolutionary War.His role as General convinced him of the need for Federal power to raise money for, among other things, an army. The details of the Continental Army's condition during the war further illustrate the amazing nature of America's defeat of what was then the world's preeminent military power. For example, during the winter of 1776-1777, many soldiers went without shoes and fought a well equipped British Army. It is interesting to learn more about the relationship between Washington and his chief aid in the war and as President; Alexander Hamilton. Moreover, Ellis draws some interesting contrasts between Washington and Jefferson (both of whom he has now devoted a book each) and their personal relationship. Washington emerges from this the more influential character.Galvanized by these prior experiences, Washington's influence on moving the confederation of states to the Constitutional Convention and ultimately the Constitution itself is crystal clear. No other Founding Father had such a realistic view of how to implement the new American ideals and, indeed, as Henry Lee expressed in Washington's eulogy; \\"First in war, first in peace and first in the hearts of his countrymen.\\"His Excellency does an outstanding job of giving the reader a perspective on Washington, the person and, thus, takes a little bit of the stone like statue away from his persona. Here we also learn of Washington's obsession with managing the affairs of Mt Vernon and his considerable real estate empire while also being a General and a President. We get a sense that Washington's famous aloofness and ability to remain silent in a storm were as Ellis puts it \\"protective tactics developed to prevent detection of the combustible materials simmering inside.\\"This is an outstanding book. I'd read it again and likely will someday."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"Although Joseph Ellis calls him \\"the Foundingest Father of them all,\\" George Washington remains a puzzling figure. Washington may have intended to remain so. In _His Excellency: George Washington_ (Knopf), Ellis has continued a string of fine biographies of characters from the American Revolution, and has made the man somewhat less puzzling. Washington is a hard subject, not only because he has been elevated to the status of national god with all the mythology attending such status, but also because he took pains not to reveal himself. His diary entries, even on the days we now consider the most vital in our history, might have contained only comments on the weather or where he dined. In social situations, he had \\"a natural dignity (or was it aloofness?)\\" that kept others away, and he was comfortable keeping silent while others squirmed for something to say. His correspondence during his presidential years was mostly about the management of his farms at Mount Vernon. He destroyed much of his personal correspondence, and his wife burned all but three of his letters to her. But Ellis demonstrates that \\"Washington's legendary calmness and statuelike stolidity masked truly volcanic energies and emotions.\\" There have been plenty of other biographies of this astonishing man, but Ellis's has not just given the basic details of the life, but also tried to explain the inner life, despite the subject's reticence.Ellis's Washington is not the idealized Father of Our Country, full only of honesty, dignity, and virtue. He is, instead, aggressive, ambitious, eager for monetary gain, and constantly looking to his portrait for posterity. In the French and Indian war, his successes were minor, but his reputation was secure. He became, in many ways, a typical aristocratic farmer, spending lavishly on the costumes and architecture favored by English society, and was in debt to British merchants for them. He loathed this dependency, and Ellis shows that the Washington who wanted to be free of it was the Washington motivated to fight for economic, not just political, freedom. There was plenty of sincere rhetoric about liberty, but financial liberty was always on Washington's mind. When he fought in the Revolution, he lost more battles than he won and \\"was not by any standard a military genius.\\" He learned from his mistakes, and emerged as easily the most famous man in America at the end of the war. He made a public exit from the national stage that astonished the world; he wanted no coronation, he wanted no office, he merely wanted to return to his farm. It was the sort of self control that no Caesar or Napoleon could have shown, but Ellis concludes that Washington was always thinking about his place in history (he did not have traditional religious view, and never seems to have been concerned about his place in heaven). Similarly, he was not eager to assume the presidency, even though unanimously voted in (which \\"scarcely leaves me the alternative for an option\\") but there was no avoiding the role if posterity was to hold him in good opinion.True to traditions started only in the last century, Ellis takes seriously Washington's connection to slavery. He had many slaves himself, and the main worry they presented him was that the system was inefficient; not only were there workers on his farm, but he was saddled with the upkeep of their families (which he would not split up), many of whom could not work because of youth, age, or illness. He was interested, as a businessman, not as a liberator, in hired, free labor. He was progressive in some ways; he freed some slaves at the end of his life, and he allowed slaves to be soldiers in the army. But he was a man of his time, and committed to keeping the young union strong; he refused to commit the nation to abolition, and was glad when it was taken off the national agenda during his time. \\"What strikes us as a poignant failure of moral leadership appeared to Washington as a prudent exercise in political judgment.\\" More satisfactory to us, he did arrange for the freeing of his slaves (albeit posthumously), and was the only prominent Virginian to do so at the time. Ellis's finely nuanced biography gives a full picture of a vital American presence; this is not the Washington of the heroic statues and portraits, but a remarkable, flawed man who really was human, accessible, and admirable."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"This is my first Washington biography, which I picked up based on the 4-star/245-review rating. I guess I should have spent more time reading the feedback before purchasing.I agree with most of the skeptical reviews already posted regarding this book, so I won't reiterate those points of contention here. Instead, I'd like to point out additional concerns I noticed in the book after Washington's dismissal of the Continental Army and the return of regional authority to the Continental Congress (starting in Chapter 6, pg. 188). At that point, the portrayal of Washington's presidency didn't seem to jive with other historical volumes I've read previously, and this is when I believe Ellis's 20th-century bias blooms in full color.At every opportunity during the telling of Washington's two terms as President, Ellis glorifies Hamilton and the Federalist cause (\\"consolidated\\" government) while vilifying every maneuver and objection by Jefferson and Madison (Republican -- dispersed government) as underhanded if not outright treasonous (pg. 247). Ellis glosses over Hamilton's unconstitutional creation of the National Bank (pg. 204), the wholly inappropriate Jay Treaty that guaranteed future war with Great Britain (pg. 226), and the scandalous conspiracy behind the near-creation of the Provincial Army by Hamilton (again) and Pickering (pg. 249). Ellis's pot-shot at Jefferson in the second-to-the-last page of the book (a weak comparison to the \\"noble\\" Hamilton) is a thinly-veiled insult leveled at our 3rd President. These idealogical distractions from the Washington story-line completely wrecked the last third of the book for me.From what I now gather, there are other Washington biographies more worthy of my money and time. My next purchases will be \\"Washington: The Indispensable Man\\" by James Thomas Flexner (4.5 stars/63 reviews) and \\"The Real George Washington\\" by Jay A. Parry (4.5 stars/42 reviews)."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"I was somewhat disappointed with Ellis's portrayal of George Washington. To me it seemed that more time was put into discussing his faults rather than his successes. If I didn't know any better I would have come away from reading this book with a rather unimpressive view of Washington."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"......and that's the way he wanted it. Probably no man in history has had so many biographies; we still have a tough time seeing Washington as a real living person. Washington was a quiet, reserved man who kept his feelings to himself. Paridoxically, he is difficult to fathom for exactly the opposite reason Thomas Jefferson is....Tom laid everything out in the open, but it was self contradictory, and stated in his own terms, the definition of those terms known but to himself.This is a very good, basic, starter volume on George Washington. The family, especially his older half brother Lawrence, are all here. His mother, Mary Ball Washington, is barely mentioned. Just as well; though George got his strength of character, and his great riding ability, from her, she was a real \\"Mommie Dearest\\". Their relationship ranged from non-existant to worse right up to her death early in his Presidency. Washington had to make his own way from his mid teens on, and we all know the result. Surveyor, land investor, soldier; he did it all well. We get a good view of his campaigns in the French and Indian Wars, and, of course, the Revolution. This was a man who simply refused to lose. He seemed to realize that if he never \\"lost\\", he would eventually win. Oh, he lost battles, but he never lost his Army, or the will to fight another day. We don't realize how close a thing it was in '76.George Washington's political career may, or may not, have been reluctantly entered upon. He had to invent a job, and help invent a country. [I think that Jefferson really invented America, but that's another topic]. It wasn't all roses. The most revered man on earth had second term problems that make those of our present day George seem mild.Joseph Ellis has produced an excellent \\"short version\\" of our country's \\"Father\\". The high points are all here, the motivations and side angles are well covered, and the massively strong character of the man comes thru. Oh, he had faults; he liked pretty ladies, though, as with everything else, he kept within limits. Overly ambitious, he was ambitious for the good of all. He wasn't much of a son, but he didn't have much of a mother. By the way, GEORGE WASHINGTON DID NOT HAVE WOODEN TEETH!!! He did hate slavery, yet owned slaves. Others did, too; at least Washington was bothered by it. Nothing bothered Jefferson.If you only want to read one book on George Washington, this is an excellent choice. True also of Willard Sterne Randall, Richard Harwell's abridgement of Douglas Southall Freeman, or Flexner's one volume abridgement of his own four volumes. If you have plenty of money for books, a LOT of time, and the desire to know everything, Freeman's seven volumes are definitive. I'll mention one more: Chief Justice John Marshall had access to Washington's papers, and wrote a multi volume set that he revised numerous times over his last 30+ years. We can argue about \\"definitive edition\\" and number of volumes. (AND, be warned, Thomas Jefferson's charge is TRUE...it IS, in many ways, a \\"Federalist political tract\\". Still, it had value as a historical document). Two years before he died, he did a final one volume version; that book is in print, and can be had for about $14 at the John Marshall House in Richmond. The folks there say that they sell a lot; I suspect I'm one of the few who actually read it. The writing style is different from what we're used to, but if you've already read 2 or 3 other bios of Washington, try it. Don't read it as a first book. Overall, Ellis gets my very high recommendation."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"In \\"His Excellency\\" Author Joseph J. Ellis provides the reader with an interesting and thorough life of George Washington. Without boring the reader with details, Ellis covers all the highlights of the Washington lore. We travel along on the disastrous first military excursion to the west and to the Massacre on the Monongahela. The advancement of Washington's military career with his command of the command of the Virginia Blues, the depths and heights of the Revolution and the essential but rocky presidency are all explained to the reader.Ellis does a very good job at integrating facts into the themes of the book. In explaining the economy of the farms and Washington's speculation in western lands he shows how Washington's personal economics contributed to the evolution of his self-image from that of an Englishman to that of an independent American.Another well developed theme is that of the combination of Washington's genius to know the nature and timing of what was needed from him and the character to deliver it. Perhaps his greatest insight was to know how and when to exit, from the Army, the Presidency and the Society of the Cincinnati.Knowing how the story ends, we tend to think that it had to play out as it did. This book shows how the story could have ended sooner. Washington's reputation could have been destroyed by his bungling in the French and Indian War. He repeatedly teetered on the brink of defeat during the Revolution. Often he taunted death and barely escaped with fallen mounts and bullet pocked clothes. At the successful end of the Revolution, Washington's public service appeared to be completed. With his family medical history and the state of national development, political service seemed an unlikely prospect. While we think of Washington as the unchallenged leader, Ellis demonstrates that the tradition of a rocky second term, along with many other presidential precedents, started with him.As Ellis establishes, for many of us, Washington is an icon. Ellis brings him to life. He shows us Washington's uncertainties and failures. As we see Washington's failures we wonder how he ever became a success. As we read on, we understand how this stumbling, learning soldier and statesman provided the leadership necessary to establish the nation which he envisioned. For anyone with a desire to know the real George Washington, \\"His Excellency\\" is an excellent choice."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"Joseph J. Ellis presents in His Excellency a modern and balanced perspective of the life and accomplishments of the Father of the Republic. Anyone who enjoys the shrewd analysis present in Richard Hofstadter's landmark book, The American Political Tradition, will enjoy this Washington biography.Mr. Ellis does a good job of demonstrating how Washington's military successes were part luck, part Providence, and part being able to listen to others' advice and learn from mistakes. He also makes it vividly clear how the American Revolution was much more of an uphill battle than any of us have ever been taught in our American History classes. Revolutionary sentiment waxed and waned, and it was an accomplishment enough for Washington to simply have kept the Continental Army in existence. Similarly, his greatest accomplishment as President was simply keeping the nascent Republic together (or Empire as Washington thought it).Mr. Ellis also does a fantastic job in demonstrating how much a visionary Washington was and how far removed he was from the political leaders of the era. Washington could have taken over the country for himself after the war was won; instead, he went into retirement like a Cincinatus. That again, is something spectacular considering other revolutionary leaders in history like Napoleon and Oliver Cromwell who ultimately became authoritarian rulers. Washington, moreover, chiefly saw the United States' future lying to the West over the Alleghenies and Appalachians and not East to Europe--unlike most people at the time.Ultimately, despite a slightly distracting obsession with the issue of Washington's 300-plus slaves (the reason for my 4-star rating), Mr. Ellis can be seen to have produced a biography which allows us to see Washington as a fully three-dimensional human being (with faults and failings like all of us) and more importantly as the visionary genius he was. After reading what is probably Ellis' best work yet, you will no doubt be fantastically more informed about Washington, but also equally well convinced of the fact that he was the United States' greatest President--then, now and perhaps forever."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"This a very well written, scholarly, and truly enjoyable biography of Washington. It bridges the gap between the more popular treatments and the enormous, scholarly, and rather dry, multi-volume works by other authors, which most of us probably don't have time to read.

But in the end I did the reverse. This book is such good reading I couldn't put it down, it almost reads like a novel. I would say, however, that this book is a bit short on details - especially the great military moments like the crossing of the Delaware, or Valley Forge, etc. But what more than makes up for it are the insights into Washington's inner life. This all the more precious because Washington was notoriously guarded, and clues are hard to obtain from the archives. Another great merit of this book is that it is free of the sanctimonious and derogatory tone that comes from so much academic work these days.

He writes clearly and includes - in only 250-some pages, the others are footnotes - tons of information about the life and times of George Washington.His Excellency is an excellent introduction to Washington. The book focuses largely on the character of Washington and attempts to show readers why Washington might have acted the way he did. If you know little about the man, this may be the single best book you can buy. If you are already well versed in the subject, the book will not disappoint. It is based largely on Washington's personal papers and there are many new insights into Washington's life. Every assertion is supported with evidence. Differing points of view are considered and the reader is allowed to draw his or her own conclusions.Ellis does an exceptionally good job of tying Washington's early, formative years to his later development as a Virginia land and slave owner, Revolutionary general and, eventually, president. Ellis looks into Washington's mind and lets us peak, as much as possible, into the man and his thoughts and emotions. We get to imagine, based on reasonable inferences, what went on in Washington's mind as he defended the colonies from the British, helped to create nation, and deal with - or, better put, struggle over - the issue of slavery.If you liked Founding Brothers, which won Ellis the Pulitzer Prize, you will almost certainly like this. I found Founding Brothers to be wonderful. This was note quite as good as Founding Brothers, but it is still very much worth reading. Ellis makes every word count, leaving this reader grateful."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"Comprehensive and informative, this is a wonderful book about the life and history of George Washington. I discovered a lot of new information throughout the book, and was impressed by the breadth of information covered. This was akin to taking an intensive college course on Washington. Many myths were debunked and this was in no way a \`political book' - it was the biography/presentation of a man who shaped our American history. Even for the casual reader this would be very enjoyable. I \`read' this book via audio CD (13 CDs total), and the reader was great - very easy to listen to and understand. It make my commute much more enjoyable for several weeks."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"This book represents a new trend in historical scholarship, acting more as a personality sketch than as historical narrative. In this case, that is very good because the author addresses many unanswered questions about Washington, in the process presenting the man over the myth.Because of its berevity, readability, and well-written storyline, it is tempting to recommend this book as an introduction. However, I would recommend reading a few other detailed narratives (in particular Shaara's American Revolution books) before this to set the context.I still think the best Washington biography is Flexner's - if you have time, the four-volume set is excellent, but the one-volume edition will suffice. But that does not take anything away from Ellis'."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"In general, I tend to avoid biographies, and the older the person, the more I avoid it. But I decided to take a chance with this one, mainly because of the good reviews below. Man, am I glad I did. This book is, in a word, excellent.Like most kids growing up in American, I knew OF Washington, but did not really KNOW Washington. Mr. Ellis's book does a really nice job of revealing Washington's character, warts and all. I also appreciated the fact that he did not shy away from traits or events that are not the most flattering to the man's lasting legacy (i.e. the delay until his death of the emancipation of his slaves). Historical whitewashes are not beneficial to anyone, and this is certainly not a historical whitewash.The other aspect that I really enjoyed about the book was its readability. It is as though Mr. Ellis is in the room talking with you. The style and syntax flows very evenly. I am a fan of this type of writing because, though I have a higher education, I don't always like to use it when reading for leisure.In the end, I was left wanting more information about Washington, especially about some of his pet projects that were not complete at his death (Washington DC, a military academy, etc.). However, this is not a criticism of the book, rather a complement to it since it gave me a hunger for more information. The book deftly accomplishes the author's aim which is a revelation of the character of Washington. While more information would have been interesting, it would have been a much longer (and not as readable) book. In summary, I would give it six stars if I could."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"George Washington has something of an image problem. Of all the Founding Fathers, modern audiences tend to find him the least accessible. Alexander Hamilton, Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, John Adams, James Madison, John Marshall, and even lesser lights such as Gouverneur Morris and John Jay have their modern-day advocates and fans. But considering both Washington's oversized accomplishments and unequaled status during the Revolutionary Era, his present popularity is relatively mild. Few people seem interested in the man who, all his peers agreed, stood head and shoulders above the most talented political generation in American history. It's hard to imagine, for example, a new biography on Washington selling as well as two recent biographies on Hamilton and Adams have sold.Part of the problem was Washington's temperament. As Joseph Ellis explains in his new biography of the general and president, Washington spent most of his life struggling to control himself. This control was necessary, Ellis claims, for Washington was a man of powerful emotions. Alexander Hamilton, who worked on Washington's staff during several years of the Revolutionary War, was known to later remark that the general, though possessed of a cool faade, was a man with an explosive, almost violent temper in private. Ellis writes, \\"[s]ome models of self-control are able to achieve their serenity easily, because the soul-fires never burned brightly to begin with. Washington became the most notorious model of self-control in all of American history, the original marble man, but he achieved this posture - and it was a posture - the same hard-earned way he learned soldiering, by direct experience with difficulty.... Appearances aside, he was an intensely passionate man, whose powers of self-control eventually became massive because of the interior urges they were required to master.\\"Ellis points to several key moments in Washington's life when he would side-step what he wanted to do in order to accomplish some greater personal or national aim: marrying Martha Dandridge Custis and acquiring her property rather than pursuing his true love, Sally Fairfax; breaking away from plantation farming to diversify his crops, so that he would no longer be dependent on British merchants (even though such dependence was typical for most Virginia planters, and extremely difficult to break out of); using Fabian tactics to avoid fighting the British, rather than his preferred method of engaging them directly; freeing his slaves in his final will and testament, despite the large difficulties this entailed.All these incidents would be largely meaningless if they did not correspond to the most remarkable event in Washington's life and probably the most important non-event in America's early history: Washington's refusal to take up the monarchical standard after the British were forced to quit the war. In 1783, members of the Continental Army - loyal to Washington -- were unhappy because the Confederation Congress had not paid them what they were owed; the new federal government was weak; and Washington had what Ellis describes as a \\"transcendent stature\\" in the young country. This combination gave the general a large opportunity to make himself a king. Countless other revolutionary leaders had done so in similar circumstances. But Washington refused the temptation, even when the so-called Newburgh Conspiracy opened an avenue for him to attempt such a move. As Ellis explains of Washington's famous speech to the disgruntled officers, when he would quell their potential rebellion by distancing himself from their declared need for action, \\"whereas Cromwell and later Napoleon made themselves synonymous with the revolution in order to justify the assumption of dictatorial power, Washington made himself synonymous with the American Revolution in order to declare that it was incompatible with dictatorial power.\\"Here was the legendary Cincinnatus. In a massive act of self-control, Washington decided he would return to Mount Vernon rather than take up the mantle of king or emperor. What makes the general's decision even more remarkable is that at the time he believed in the need for a strong federal government and a standing army, and often said so. One reason Hamilton and he were in such congruence for the need of a strong central government, both then and later, had been their shared difficulties with a weak Congress during the Revolutionary War. They both came to see -- in a way Jefferson, who had not served, did not - that the young republic needed a strong overseer to the states, if it was to survive. But even believing this as passionately as he did, Washington would not take the mantle of power by force. It would be his finest gift to the country, far greater than any of his military and, later, political contributions, as outstanding as many of those were.But it was a non-action that, in hindsight, looks more inevitable than it actually was, and for this reason isn't as appreciated as it should be. Washington's need for self-control made it possible, but that same self-control is a large reason why he does not have the popularity other Founding Fathers have today. He is distant and remote, both then and now. Hamilton's wife found him a cold dance partner, complaining that he went dutifully through the steps and retired from the floor with few words. Others said that he was the most comfortable man in silence they ever met. Gouverneur Morris, in what Ellis calls the most insightful comments on Washington, would say he was a man of tumultuous passions, and that there was a connection between his grip on himself and his understanding of the dynamics of power. Gilbert Stuart, who studied Washington closely as he painted his portrait, saw a similar control: \\"Had he been born in the forests, he would have been the fiercest man among savage tribes.\\"Joseph Ellis's fine work illuminates a man the present day is in danger of losing. Of all the Founding Fathers, Washington is the most difficult to understand. Unlike a Hamilton or Adams, he did not wear his heart on his sleeve. Unlike a Jefferson, he did not leave a large paper trail to throw light on an obscure public figure. Unlike a Franklin, he was not a natural wit and bon vivant. While the Parson Weems' story where a young Washington admits to his father that he chopped down the cherry tree is a fabrication, it is easy to see why many people could believe it. Washington's solidity is granite-like and simple morality tales go well with that solidity. It is only on closer inspection that the human cracks in that granite become visible and something more interesting -- because more human -- begins to emerge."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"This is my first biography on George Washington, and I readily devoured this book. As the de facto leader of the American Revolution, he united the American colonies, defeated the British, won the country's independence, and became the world's most famous man during his time.The author did a good job at portraying Washington as a mere mortal, though, with all-too-human qualities, rather than as a saint or superhuman. I learnt new facts about Washington that I never knew.(1) George Washington was one of the richest Americans of his time! This was revealed when his will was drawn. He owned huge plots of land and over 200 slaves. However, he had the assets but not liquid money, which he was always short off. He watched over his accounts with a ruthless eye. For example, when he discovered that some settlers had settled on his land, he took them to court and eventually won!(2) George Washington was the first and only president to lead an army and go into battle during his office term.(3) Washington was always conscious of death. His family all died before the age of 50, and he always felt that his time had come. The thought of death was always looming in his head.(4) Washington regarded his slaves as assets and was not eager to free them. In fact, when any of them ran away he made sure to find them! It was only in his will that he finally ordered his estate to free his slaves after his death (on December 14, 1799). The author leaves the reader confused as to why Washington did not free his slaves during his lifetime, since he eventually came to recognize slavery as \\"a massive American anomaly.\\"(5) After defeating the British, Washington could have taken over the country for himself. Instead, he went into retirement. When Congress unanimously elected him president, he accepted reluctantly. He was also pressured into serving a second term against his wishes. Though he was encouraged to run for a third term, he declined the offer.(6) His life story showed me that even great men have opponents. He faced criticism and ridicule throughout his career by many of his own contemporaries. Many were very harsh towards him accusing him of senility and of being a dictator. But unlike Napoleon or King George of England, he had no aspirations of becoming king or emperor, and I was quite impressed by that. His aim was to maintain the independence of his new country, and to avoid any swing towards monarchy.(7) It was in 1781 with the help of General Lafayette's French army that Washington was finally able to defeat the British. Vive la France!(8) George Washington is famous for his false teeth.(9) Washington was not a tactician. He lost many battles and made a lot of blunders. For example, his decision to fight the English in Canada, where most of his troops died of disease and starvation, and ended up eating their horses and returning home without shoes!(10) He was sympathetic towards the native Indians. He often said that they were like him, fighting for independence. He strongly believed that treaties with them should be honored (they never were).(11) Washington's amazing career was driven by self-interest. Ellis suggests that nearly every decision Washington made was based on some selfish desire to further his economic standing. Everything Washington did, Ellis claims, was based on greed and lust for recognition and wealth. Ellis paints the portrait of a bitter, violent, selfish, and greedy Washington. He states that Washington's men were frequently beaten and occasionally executed when any disobeyed orders or defected. He was very aware of his place in history and he chose his actions with an eye toward what people would think of him in the future. It is difficult to know for certain what he truly believed, and what he just said or wrote for posterity.(12) Washington did not believe in a heaven or hell.After reading this book, I ordered all DVDs about George Washington. The author really encouraged me to know more about this great man who despite the power he wielded, did not succumb to it and never wanted to be king! Not many possessing such power would have done the same.I now better understand the man I never really knew. It was a real pleasure getting to know him.This is a great book and I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"I've read 3 books on George Washington. This one is my favorite. I've read it 3 times ... not because it's as in depth as the other two, but because this book seems to be an easier read, and because I feel it paints a more personal and intimate picture of Washington as a man and a human being. I recommend this book to others and have bought other copies to give as gifts to friends."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"Ellis has come into his own of late, deservedly so. I bought this because I liked Founding Brothers, and was rewarded for the effort."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"In today's age where there are no great men, because it has become fashionable to dwell upon the flaws. It is a relief that George Washington's reputation still comes out very well, even when based upon on the new cache of information, his personal letters that were recently discovered. This is a very well written book; it weaves the letters and the historical facts together artfully. On one side, you have a member of the Southern planter aristocracy, a slave owner, fastidious about accounts and augmenting his land holdings and on the other side a prestigious general who is perhaps the only personality that could have held the 13 colonies together. The author contends that Washington was chosen to lead the Continental Army because he stood out in any crowd as a man of distinction. A tall man with greater than usual strength, a regal countenance that destined him to be a leader within every crowd. The author shows that George Washington actually cultivated this tendency. Crowd appearances with poses in military uniforms. His letters showed his concerns about his reputation for posterity.The book offers many insights. It showed that the reason the Virginia landed-gentry was ripe ground for a revolution is that Britain's mercantilist system was squeezing their lifestyle to the point of bankruptcy. Another fact was that Washington was not aware of just how egalitarian the republic he helped to create had become. He was in favor of joining a hereditary land owning class after the War of American Independence until the \\"common folk\\" made it clear that this would jeopardize his reputation. I highly recommend this book; the author deserves much credit very bringing the information to light."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"Joseph Ellis' book proves to be a very insightful and thoughtful look at our foremost Founding Father. This is not your typical biography per say but more of a character study of the man. By centering on Washington's character and the impact it had to the world around him, the author managed to bring alive George Washington's humanity. By doing this, the author managed to allowed us to understand the influence Washington had as our leader during and after the Revolutionary War and how this shape our nation's destiny. The author proves to be fair to his subject. Washington we see in this book is a man full of greatness and flaws the enabled us to see beyond his iconic image that we see him today. This is a relatively short book, highly readable and gives the reader an excellent understanding of what made George Washington click.Since detail study of events of Washington's life is not found here, I would recommended other books if anyone is interested in such details. But if anyone truely wants to understand Washington as a man and don't want to slugged through several hundred pages to do so, then this book is for you."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"Ellis captures the importance of Washington as the critical first US President and preserver of the union of States. Perhaps no one could have helped create a stable democracy without a man of his high principals, confidence of abilities, the ability to select competent men to serve and a certain forebearance that made the position of President so prestigous. Washington's officers suggested that he become a dictator but he eliminated any thought of such and retired from public life only to be drafted into the position of President long after resigning from the Army. Ellis' book is a fast paced biography that reviews Washington's early years as a surveyor and VA. officer as well as his role in the French and Indian War. Ellis even captures Washington's interesting but liitle known error in judgement when he captured a French fort with Indian allies who impulsively and without authoriozation slaughter the survivors. The book moves quickly over the Revoloutionary War and efficiently covers the war without tactical study. What evolves in Ellis' book is a study of Washington's personality, his strong pride, his ability to overcome a limited education, his ability to be above petty squabbles and be a stoic and competent leader with an air of authority. Ellis notes that Washington's pride created errors in judgement when confronting the british in early battles but that with consultation with his trusted staff, he becomes more adept at fighting a \\"fabian\\" stealth style of battle to live another day. He expected great loyalty and those that crossed him in some fashion paid the consequence such as General Charles Lee who was abused at Monmouth more for his loyalties than his battle actions. His practical sense as President to steer clear of foreign alliances again seems to fashion his fabian sense of battle as he recognizes that the US is not strong enough for a major war until at least the 1820s which proves true. Ellis points out that position on eliminating slavery is sympathetic yet he postpones any address of the situation until the country's unity is stronger to tolerater the great issue. Later rankled by the conflicts among the Federalists and Jefferson's Republicans he seemed intent to be above the fray. After reading Ellis' book, it appears that the man who rode his personal chariot in full uniform to the Continental congress knew the effect of his controlled presence and he had the ability to lead brillant men such as Jefferson, Hamilton and utilize their services. The most interesting part of the book is the intrigues of Jefferson who through secret correspondence criticizes Washington as great but senile and covertly utilizes a critical press to harshly attack his policies. Washington later writes of Jefferson \\"one of the most artful, intriguing,, industrious and double faced politicians in America\\". Had John Adams been the first President, the union may not have held since those earliest of years required someone with the ultimate respect of a nation and for the time, that man was Washington."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"This is, without a doubt, the best biography on Washington that I've ever read. Riveting from cover to cover. If you're interested in Washington, this book is an essential read. Buy this book, it will not dissapoint!"},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"Ellis has written an easy to read history of Washington, composed with enough depth and human interest to entertain those, like myself, who wouldn't call themselves historians.The most interesting angle to follow while reading this book is Ellis's tight rope act, as he tries to draw GW as both a flawed man made of flesh and bone, and also as a truly great historical icon who's worthy of the monuments we've built for him.Eventually, Ellis gives into his desire to exalt Washington. For instance, he praises GW's \\"prescient\\" decision to free his slaves at the end of his life, while at the same time he excuses Washington for choosing not to confront the slavery issue as the president. That's how this biography tends to go. When a finally retired Washington unwisely pushed the young president Adams to install a scheming Alexander Hamilton as the commander of a new federal army to prepare for a looming \\"French Invasion,\\" Ellis acknowledges this as a gaffe on G-Dub's record, but he can't acknowledge the possibility that Washington erred because of senility or even wicked intentions. Instead, he excuses Washington as being nostalgic for his glory days as commander of the continental army. So even when Washington makes mistakes, Ellis is never interested in letting them deter from being \\"His Excellency.\\"It's clear throughout the book that Ellis has concluded - after painstaking research (\\"A note from the author\\" says that Ellis didn't use any research assistants while writing this book) - that Washington IS worthy of his monuments and overall iconic treatment. He believes Washington understood his role as a unifying symbol for the fragile states, and used his amazing popularity for the noble purpose of bonding together the United States. Ellis believes GW's motives for becoming the nation's first president were just, proven, he believes, by the fact that Washington viewed presidential leadership as more of a burden than anything. And yet he still chose to serve. Ellis seems to admire this completely.A eulogy for GW declared he was \\"first in the hearts of Americans\\" or something to that effect, and it's clear that Ellis wants present-day Americans to feel that original sense of pride in their founding father. Personally, I've met several people in my life who have felt just the opposite. I can remember my 8th grade history teacher telling us that Washington was a Yes Man who worked his way up the ladder by kissing the butts of higher authorities. I've met others with the same opinion. So it's interesting to have a well-researched biography that would seem to speak in contrast to those Washington naysayers.Overall, it was a very solid read about a topic that most Americans are sorely under educated on. Did you know Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton loathed each other? Did you know about the rift between Jefferson and Washington? Did you know Washington had a crush on a woman who wasn't Martha?I absolutely recommend this book."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"I can't presume to add much of substance to the wonderful review by Theo Logos, so I won't. But I would point out that this is a book that can easily be read by anyone. You don't have to be a history student or William Buckley to understand this fine work. Lots of revelations. Washington is now a person to me, not a icon."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"The tone of this book is a bit cold and academic. The information is there but the read wasn't really enjoyable. It was at times very dry and sometimes cynical, not showing Washington (his actions or intelligence) in the most flattering light.I read 'The Real George Washington' a few months later and enjoyed it much more. It was a positive and patriotic book. TRGW was three times longer (900 pgs but a faster read somehow?) and includes many paintings, and maps of historical figures, locations and battles, there are only a few pages of illo's in 'His Excellency. At the end of TRGW there were also a few hundred pages of his personal and public letters; it's a superior book in my opinion.Again, 'His Excellency\\" wasn't bad, but it is a short book, 275 pgs, and feels more like a cliff notes version of his life. I'd recommend it to anyone interested in getting a glimpse at Washington's life but not to anyone wanting a more in depth look."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"Now that winter is here you may be looking for a book to keep you company as you sit by the fire on long evenings. If you have a taste for American history this is an almost perfect choice. Granted there are no surprise zingers, no wow new factoids, but this very readable, well organized and precise biography of Washington is a contemporary version of \\"The Essential Man.\\" As his contemporaries sometimes noted, Washington seems to have been providentially at the center of the important events of his times. The early chapters of the book present a clear version of the Jumonville affair and its consequences. And then effectively develops the metaphor of Washington as a sort of keystone holding the arc of the revolution in place. Recent televison presentations on the battles of Long Island and later Trenton, as well as some discussions of the sufferings of the troops at VAlley Forge, give us some sense of how important Washington's ability to keep the army in existance was for the success of the cause. There is a sound case that it was the army, not cities or fortifications which was essential for final victory. The military analysis centers on this theme and how it played into and against Washington's character. His personal convictions concerning the necessity of the Constitutional reform and his sense of the presidency are seen within the scope of these shaping experiences. The final chapters, detailing the Federalist - Republican conflict reveals a side of Jefferson and Madison which is not often made so public today. Certainly there is adequate reason to question the belief advanced elsewhere that reactionary elements hijacked the revolution in the establishment of the federal government. The lessons of this book are still to be considered in today's national life."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"This book outlines the complete man and what motivated him consistently through adulthood. For example, he was motivated towards independence as he saw Virginia aristocracy fall victim to a perpetual debt to British economic control in trade and goods. This puts the motives behind the man. Ellis also outlines the excellence of Washington's character with this flaws and mistakes, in his 2nd term and in his final retirement. This makes us admire him all the more. Ellis' treatment of Washington's lack of moral leaderhsip on slavery is unfortunately unsatisfyng, but it seems this is because it was in fact a lack of moral leadership. What was he thinking? We will probably never know."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"His Excellency is the opposite of those \\"life and times\\" behemoths of the nineteenth century in which biography and history were presented together, often ponderously. Ellis's brief volume offers more of a contemporary commentary on Washington's life rather than a typical nuts-and-bolts biography. And that's all to the good so long as the reader knows what sort of book he's engaged. His Excellency is a joy to read, and Ellis is a master storyteller (a gift that contributed to some recent academic unpleasantness). Ellis's Washington makes sense to me: a colonial aristocrat who sought, like some ancient Roman, to achieve both material success and the approbation of posterity--and got them both. Few men have been able to achieve such greatness and then also had greatness thrust upon them."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"Every American (well almost every American) knows who George Washington was. But what do you really know about our first President? He is more an icon and a saint than a real person in the minds of most of us. So, along comes HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON by pulitzer prize-winning Joseph Ellis to inform us about the man. Or about the man's career. This brief biography (275 pages not counting notes) is not a military history or a study of the times or even a personal account of George Washington. Rather it is more the story of his purpose-driven life in the real world. Did you know, for example, that George Washington was a very asute businessman and died one of the richest men in America? He was able to defer gratification for greater rewards in all aspects of his life - love, war, politics, business - and, as such, is perhaps our greatest example of the benefits of such practice, not only to him but to his newly born nation. Mr. Ellis gives us a very readable and entertaining biography. He dedicates HIS EXCELLENCY to W.W. Abbot, his former professor at William and Mary, who was the founding editor of the modern edition of THE PAPERS OF GEORGE WASHINGTON on which Mr. Ellis drew much of the basis for this biography. Washington was a strong man. Gilbert Stuart's portrait on the dust jacket reflects what the artist saw in Washington: \\"Had he been born in the forests, he would have been the fiercest man among the savage tribes.\\""},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"Joseph J. Ellis' biography of George Washington, His Excellency, is, well, excellent. I must admit that I don't normally enjoy biography, but after reading Washington's Crossing earlier this year, I felt compelled to pick up this one. The book examines Washington's life, sometimes in minute detail, and gives us a portrait of a man who was neither a complete saint nor a complete sinner. This is Washington, the human, although, the fact that he survived the Revolutionary War seems almost superhuman, something Ellis has some fun with. The book portrays Washington as a man who grew and matured as time went on. In the years before the Revolutionary War, he wasn't the most likeable person, but something happened to him along the way that made him certainly worthy of the greatness ascribed to him. He was not without his faults--two issues he should have addressed during his presidency, slavery and Native Americans are dealt with head on in this book. In the end, though, the book concludes that he is a man who did much more to benefit the nation than to harm it. His Excellency is a terrific biography, one which brings life to the man on your dollar bill."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"Most biographies of our Founding Fathers fall into one of two catagories: hagiographies or hatchet jobs. Happily, this book falls into neither catagory, but steers a middle line when discussing the life of our first president. The reader receives both the good and the bad of Washington's life, not that there is a lot of \\"bad\\" to go around. In a relatively short book, as this one is, it is not possible to go into all the many twists and turns of a famous life, and inevitably some things are left out of the writing. For instance, the discussion of Washington's two terms as president is rather skimpy, but to go into a lot of detail about incidents both domestic and foreign would, at least, double the length of the book. This work concentrates rahter exclusively on Washington the man, his life and actions, and delves into, as far as is possible at this time distance, his reasons for doing many of the things he did. It's very well written, and even the reader with no background in that period of American hitory will find it extremely informative."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"Everyone knows about George Washington. Father of his country, wooden teeth, couldn't tell a lie...the list goes go and on. Much of the list is inaccurate, though, and most of the rest misunderstood. Joseph Ellis has done a fine job of setting some of that to rights.\\"His Excellency\\" sets out to examine what Washington was like as a person, and while it necessarily cannot completely succeed, it does an admirable job of helping the modern reader grasp what went into America's most essential citizen. Ellis takes the reader through Washington's life with an assessment at each turn of how certain events effected or were effected by Washington's personality. The portrait which emerges is far more interesting than the stereotypical lore most Americans are familiar with, and the reader is likely to come away from \\"His Excellency\\" with greater respect for Washington as he truly was than one could ever respect a mere icon.Ellis possesses an enviable flair for prose, making several hundred pages fly by. Washington's life becomes an intriguing story under Ellis's care, almost reading like a novel rather than history. More historians should write so cleanly.\\"His Excellency\\" should be high on the reading list of anyone seeking a better understanding of just how precarious America's emergence from thirteen colonies was, and just how important one man was to our eventual success."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"Positive: This well-written, easy to read, even entertaining book helps penetrate the marble facade of Washington and also provides a good overview of the challenges of the Revolution.Negative: Ellis's admirable preference for original research means that he includes little that isn't present in Washington's papers. For example, Martha is barely mentioned, even though she took up camp with Washington throughout the Revolution, presumably because she destroyed her correspondence. Ellis would have done well to have gone a bit further out on a limb to round out his portrait. In the one area he did (his discussion of Washington's attitudes about slavery), the result is illuminating."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"The only reason Ellis' portrait of George Washington is less engaging than the McCullough biography of John Adams is that any personal correspondence between Washington and his family has been lost or deliberately destroyed. Consequently, Ellis can only turn to the public record and official correspondence in search of Washington, the man.The man who reveals himself in that public way is a complex mix. He figures as a military leader beset with an inexperienced army, a non-existent budget and an unusually large piece of land to defend from the enemy. He is a man of great personal principals who has to modify his beliefs to fulfill what he perceives as his responsibilities as steward of his wife's property. He lacks the classical formal education of Adams and Jefferson. He seems to have confined his reading to military histories and agricultural treatises. But, as Ellis concludes, this lack of knowledge of what worked for governments of the past may be the key aspect of Washington's ability to envision and lead a brand new government for the democratic United States of America.Like all the best literature of the American revolution, this biography will make you grateful for the sacrifices of the founders that made possible the freedoms enjoyed by Americans today."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"Joseph Ellis' biography of George Washington goes beyond a simple recounting of the known facts of Washington's life. The author has set for himself the much tougher task of determining what made George Washington the man he was. Along the way, Ellis, author of several other revolutionary biographies, provides some vital context in which to judge the challenges faced by a young Washington and the way he overcame those challenges.What emerges from \\"His Excellency\\" is a Washington who wrestled with ambition and with moral leadership. The young Wahington learned hard lessons on the Virginia frontier as a surveyor and later as a leader of Virginia milita troops, and still more as an aide to a British general in a French and Indian War campaign that went badly. Other lessons followed, as a prominent planter, as a member of the Virginia legislature, and as a leader of the Revolution. At the end of the day, Ellis finds, as most of his countrymen did, that Washington was the right man in the right place to lead the Revolutionary Army and to be first president. His careful balancing of ambition and morality left a legacy of restraint not always followed by his successors. Ellis's portrait is not always flattering; it is perhaps best read in conjunction with other studies; recommended."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"Joseph J. Ellis's new biography of George Washington, \\"His Excellency\\", gives us an intriguing insight into the mind and actions of our first president. Washington does, indeed, remain the most enigmatic of the founding fathers and Ellis explains Washington in ways both his contemporaries and succeeding generations regarded him. To this end, the author succeeds.Like Washington himself, Ellis's book matures with each turn of the page. I was ready to give the book four stars until being reminded that Washington should be considered the best president ever...if he hadn't set up the historical precedents he had, the country would not have turned out the way we have. Thanks to Washington, subsequent presidents have been able to follow a remarkable guide.Ellis begins his narrative with Washington as a young soldier in the French and Indian wars and determinedly leads the reader through Washington's service during the American Revolution and ultimately, as president. For some this might not be new ground, but it is reassuring to know how much the United States could not have gotten off the ground had Washington not been in the middle of events. If he was indeed stoic and reserved, Ellis points out that Washington was also passionate and had times of angry outbursts....not uncommon for a man with his disposition.There are many pages in \\"His Excellency\\" devoted to Washington's thoughts and deeds regarding slavery...one of the more fascinating aspects of the book. Torn between idealism and realism, Washington's thinking was years ahead of those around him, even though he thought that ending slavery would be a divisive issue in the fragile nature of the new union.In summing up Washington, Ellis produces one sentence that leapt out at me when I read it. He says, \\"his remarkably reliable judgment derived from his elemental understanding of how power worked in the world\\". That judgment, with all the balancing acts that Washington had to do, is perhaps his overriding achievement after all. I recommend \\"His Excellency\\" to all who want to have a fresh look at the man who was \\"first in war, first in peace, and first in the hearts of his countrymen\\"."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"I appreciate that the author may have simply wanted to attract a popular audience, and given modern day ignorance of the founding of our country, if he imparted some new info to the numbskull set that's a worthy achievement. But, hopefully, not being a member of the aforementioned numbskull set myself, I found the book too shallow, too incomplete. And, whereas I got some new perspectives on our man George, I don't feel I really LEARNED much new. I think Ellis should have gone into just a little more detail about the major stages in Washington's life -- it would have created more understanding. I think David McCullough is much better at this type of thing than is Ellis. I dunno, maybe I was expecting a McCulloughesque book. Also, I didn't feel I got to know Martha very well. Ellis mentions her stintingly, yet, she was probably a major influence on Washington's life. I feel the author just skipped through the life of this great man when a more detailed account of his life would have made the book more valuable."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"George Washington is my favorite historical character, and I've read a number of GW biographies. When I heard that Ellis had written a GW biography, I hoped that my interest in Washington--and the anticipation that I would find out something new about him--might help me to overcome my memory of Ellis' deliberate \\"mis-history\\" as a teacher at Mt. Holyoke (Google \\"Joseph Ellis Holyoke\\" if you don't know or remember the details). Unfortunately, I was disappointed to find little new...or interesting, for that matter. There are a number of good Washington biographies available, and I think this book will probably be a disappointment to most who buy it thinking that it adds to what's out there already."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"It is sad. The author has made big bucks on a book that essentially is aimed at bringing George Washington down to the level of today's politicians. There certainly is an audience for this kind of interpretation of our Founding Father and it can only be accomplished by someone who has a perspective and wants to use his skills to slant the reader's view toward his own negativity. I much preferred to read David McCullough's history, \\"1776,\\" which dwells primarily on Washington as a person and a leader, but without the hidden agenda (whatever it is) of the author of \\"His Excellency,\\" which is really an attempt to rewrite history and bring Washington down to the level of a Bill Clinton and Richard Nixon in a colonial setting. Shame on you, Mr. Ellis, although you are entitled to your opinion -- which is what this book is all about."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"Of all of the Founding Fathers, George Washington seems to be the least accessible. Washington's natural \\"Aloofness\\" has made it very difficult for modern historians to paint a clear picture of his personality and his inner workings. The job of trying to paint such a portrait has been given to Joseph Ellis, author of both \\"American Sphinx\\" and \\"Founding Brothers\\". These two works show us remarkable insight into the Revolutionary period and the central figures that took the lead roles, however, both of these works are above the level of \\"His Excellency\\". I do not blame Ellis for not living up to his previous standard... but I am blame his subject for being less obtainable.A majority of \\"His Excellency\\" deals with Washington of the French and Indian and Revolutionary wars. However, it seems like most aspects of Washington'f life are but briefly skimmed over- with his entire presidnecy taking less than 50 pages to explain. It simply was not a goal of Ellis to write a detailed study on the life of Washington - he felt that had already been accomplished.While there isn't much \\"new\\" material. Ellis does investigate Washington's life in a way that only he can. We expect this type of deep personal analysis from Ellis, and he certainly does not disppoint (to the xtent that Washington would allow him).As a whole I say this- if you are looking for a very brief (but intellectually deep) summary of Washington's life \\"His Excellency\\" is a wonderful choice."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"There is no doubt that Ellis, despite past controversies, is still a very good historian, as well as, a better than average writer. Yet Ellis seems hell-bent (pardon the pun) on either completely ignoring any of the religious beliefs--outward or inward--of most of the Founders, or denying that such beliefs had any play in shaping the men that shaped this early nation. When one does find some mention of religion in regards to Washington, or the other founders covered in \\"Founding Brothers,\\" the comments are usually derogatory and quite selective. While in \\"His Excellency\\" he does speak often of Washington's belief in Providence, he almost always uses Washington's understanding in a wholly egotistical and secular sence. Little, if any, attention is given to the religiosity of Washington's addition (and current tradition) of adding \\"So Help Me God\\" to his presidential oath, the overtly religious and moral message of his first Thanksgiving Proclamation, et. al. Ellis would do well to peruse the first few pages of Justice Scalia's recent dissent in the Kentucky Ten Commandment's case which does quite a good job in outlining a number early documents and proclamations-many from Washington himself-- that spoke specifically to religion. While some pundits might point out that Hamilton often played the part of ghost writer for Washington and that these beliefs might have been essentially those of Hamilton, Washington did proof and correct his speeches and writing so it is quite apparent that even if these were not his own words, he did, nonetheless, agree with their sentiments.Thus, Ellis' Washington is a historical figure almost completely anesthetized of religious faith. About the most that Ellis can muster is that Washington's ego was so great that he wouldn't even kneel to pray. Ellis sees fit to mention that Addison's Cato was Washington's favorite book but he fails to mention that the Bible was the other book that always rested upon his nightstand. My problem with Ellis' treatment is not that Washington was not portrayed as a Christian, for surely there is room for academic debate on whether Washington was Christian, Deist, or somewhere in the middle. Nevertheless, it is truly remarkable that in two books covering several of America's founders Ellis can muster no more that a couple of backhand jabs specifically aimed at Christianity.Besides the religious self-censorship of this book, it is also, on the whole, a slowly developing work. As was mentioned by another reviewer, the book does seem to be split into two different approaches. The later part of the book moves much faster and is quite interesting but it was a struggle to read this book despite its modest length.Finally, the length in itself is another major complaint. Walter Isaacson spent some 500-plus pages in his study of Benjamin Franklin while David McCullough spent well over 600 pages in his treatment of John Adams. Both Isaacson and McCullough works are perhaps as objective as they come and neither author had any qualms thoroughly discussing their subjects' religious belief and how their faith was an inseparable part of their very being.In the end, Ellis manages to do a great disservice to America's most famous and perhaps most important Founder by failing to give Washington a more thorough and balanced treatment. In my opinion, such an incomplete treatment would have been better left undone."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"Joseph Ellis, who in The Founding Brothers gave us one of the best history books I've read in a long time, here lays back a bit. This is a serviceable but rather ordinary biography of George Washington, short and readable, starting in his early land-surveying years and quickly moving to conflicts with mama England, the French and Indian War, where Washington became basically a self-taught military leader, the interval to the break with England, the Revolutionary War, where the Father of Our Country wasn't so much the best general around as the most dogged, and finally his years as president, where the modern reader may be surprised to learn how much muck and backbiting he suffered, as well as be surprised by a poor lapse in judgment late in his life that seriously blemished his overall reputation for good judgment as well as residing above the partisan fray. All in all not a bad book by any means, but I expected a little more heft from a writer as distinguished as Ellis. I get the impression this material was left over from mining he did for his other, more substantive books (including the magnificent American Sphinx biography of Thomas Jefferson). There is very little here that's original; also, I think Ellis gives Washington a little too much credit when it comes to the issue of his personal slaves. He (Ellis) seems both uncomfortable with the slavery issue and a little obsessed with trying to vindicate Washington by the end of his life, showing how he eventually saw the evil of his ways by freeing his slaves in his will. This reminded me of the tours of Mount Vernon I've taken where the guides are at pains to point out that Washington was a \\"nice master\\" and never abused his slaves. (How would we know? And did that make owning slaves any less morally abhorrent from a man who focused the revolution around the thought of liberty and freedom?) I felt Ellis was sort of grasping at straws to redeem his man there.Still, if you've never read a bio of Number 1 before, this is a fine a place as any to start, and Ellis also recommends other texts in the beginning of his own book if you're even more curious about George. I have since read some of them, and found them more illuminating than this book."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"The book was in perfect, new condition. I got the book in speed time."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"I just finished this book and truly enjoyed it. I love history and especially this era.

Does not seek to judge him by today's standards, but recognizes his greatness in his own time"},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"I was extremely disappointed in this book. This book was purchased as a gift for me, and I looked forward to reading it. From the beginning, I was disappointed by the tone of the book, which casts a negative tone on the father of our country.As I researched some of Ellis' sources, I found that in several parts of his book, he stated items as facts that were completely false.Ellis, following a popular trend of today, insinuates that George Washington was in love with his friend's wife, Sally Fairfax, and that he felt passionately in love with her throughout his life.Ellis admits that all we do know is based primarily on three letters Washington wrote to Sally (Fairfax). The last letter he cites was one Washington wrote near the end of his life. Mr. Ellis states that \\"in this letter, he confessed to an elderly Sally that she had been the passion of his youth, that he had never been able to forget her, 'nor been able to eradicate from my mind those happy moments, the happiest in my life, which have enjoyed in your company.\\"I decided to research his references, and look up the text of Washington's letter on the Library of Congress website. They have actual images of all of the original letters of George Washington. What I found relieved me greatly and set my mind at ease. It also made me feel disgusted than an author who claims to accurately represent the life of such a noble man could be so purposely deceptive.The actual letter was written by Washington in his later years, with his wife. He talked about how he was remembering the times of harmony and friendship that he and his wife spent with Sally and her husband at their home. He describes these times as some of the happiest of his life. At the end of his part of the letter he says \\"Mrs. Washington is about to give you an account of the changes which have happened in the neighbourhood and in our own family.\\"Mr. Ellis said that in this letter he confessed that she had been the passion of his youth. That is simply a blatant falsehood.Ellis also states that there is no evidence to show whether the relationship between Washington and Fairfax ever crossed the sexual threshold or not. Why does he even feel the need to include such a ridiculous statement? It is akin to saying that although someone spends some time at the local bank, we don't have evidence to show whether they were a bank robber or not.Attempting to insinuate that the framers of our Constitution such as Washington, Jefferson, and Franklin were immoral men, is happening more and more often in our country.In an excellent book \\"The Rewriting of America's History\\", there is an example of how deceitful this influence can be. The book explained how in an earlier edition of a school history textbook it stated that George Washington had a hot temper that he kept masterfully controlled. In a later edition of the same textbook, it simply said: \\"George Washington had a hot temper.\\" I think that is a powerful example of how a subtle adjustment can completely change our thinking of his character.I have found that this is happening more and more frequently in our world today as I have studied the founding father's lives including Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, and others.I could continue on with how careful research contradicts the opinions of Mr. Ellis, but I will simply recommend a much better book. \\"The Real George Washington\\", published by The National Center for Constitutional Studies."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"...I'd recommend this one.The biography is inclusive of all periods of Washington's life, and it presents him in the context of his time, neither apologizing for faults nor judging him by contemporary standards. It does not present him as either a military or political genius, yet still conveys how his perseverance, his character, were essential to the birth and survival of the new nation. It is also extremely readable. Washington's life story helps here. There are so many events that the biography seems like a work of fiction.Polls asking Americans to \\"rate\\" the greatest presidents show that Washington has slipped in the popular esteem. Whether that is due to ignorance, revisionism over slavery, or simply the effect of time, I can't say. However, Joseph Ellis' biography of Washington makes clear what an injustice this is. Read it, and re-discover how Washington truly earned the title \\"Father of Our Country\\"."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"The book had it's moments when I just couldn't put it down.

It does put a human quality to George Washington."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"A brief look into the father of America. Not a complete account, which Ellis admits is not the point. His Excellency is well written, concise and entertaining. Ellis focuses on some of the significant events in Washington's life before, during and after his service in public office as General and President. The image of Washington presented is a pure example of what our public officials should be, i.e. not self-serving and greedy but country above self. As with Founding Brothers and American Sphinx, His Excellency is a must read for Revolutionary War enthusiasts and scholars alike."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"Joseph Ellis has written a solid short history of the life of the greatest American. However, should the reader have time, or the inclination, for only one current book on George Washington, I strongly recommend Washington's Crossing by David Hackett Fischer over His Excellency. In Ellis' hands Washington is strangely lifeless with his eye always on his future reputation. By contrast, General Washington comes alive in the more focused effort by Professor Fischer."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"After having read American Creation, I had high expectations for His Excellency. Perhaps that has clouded my judgment, but I really think that Ellis's biography of George Washington falls short.There are many positives, to be sure. Regardless of content, Ellis's prose is so engaging that this is yet another book by him that I could not put down. Besides style, much of what I would call Washington's \\"outer\\" character is well-defined. The reader gets a sense of the bigger picture and larger personality of the General, almost like a macro-portrait of him. He was a modest elitist who truly wanted to just enjoy his homestead, but he did believe in the Glorious Cause, and, perhaps most overarching, he believed in his own potential legacy.That said, I felt like so much was wanting from this book, not just in the details of his life, but in the more \\"micro\\" driving forces behind the man. To be fair, it was not Ellis's goal to reiterate detail after detail of Washington's life, and Washington's journal itself was usually very bland and vague, but His Excellency reads more like a history book than an instrospective look into a soul. What makes it even more frustrating is that Ellis's specific goal was to take the recently released papers on Washington and gain a better understanding of who he was on the whole without having to rehash things that are well-known to us; however, all we got was a recounting of major events in his life with only some overtones of Washington's personality mixed in.This is definitely worth reading if all you see in our first President is the stoic, heroic , and iconic side, and no matter what, it is written wonderfully. But I am going to look elsewhere at some point to get a deeper sense of the person who happened to be George Washington."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"Some have wanted to reserve 5 stars to a \\"War and Peace\\" type book.

When I picked this book up, I realized all I knew about Washington was what I had been taught in grade school.Ellis is an excellent biographer who delves into many aspects of Washington's life. The narrative moved well and was entertaining. Some may be put off by Ellis' style of going into analysis of issues. I found that this added to my understanding.Washington indeed was a great man who's influence reaches us to this day. Now I know why!"},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"I found this book to be a refreshing look at the life of America's greatest founding father. Ellis does a fantastic job of getting to the meat of a seemingly endless list of resources including numerous pieces of personal correspondence, and provides a more personal look into the mind of the notoriously elusive George Washington. This work does what many other similar books don't, and that is look at Washington in the context of the broader social and historical realities of his time. Without this, many of Washington's actions seem illogical or empty. Some reviewers don't appreciate the more critical aspects of the work, but it is naive to believe that Washington was totally devoid of personal flaws and internal conflicts. In fact, I believe, as Ellis describes, that these flaws are part of what made him a great leader; what he learned from his mistakes helped guide him on his journey through a very uncertain and volatile time in world history. What is more impressive, is that Ellis is able to condense such a rich and interesting life into a relatively short volume that doesn't seem lacking. It provides enough insight for those who are looking for the basics, but gives enough for those looking for more in-depth analysis and provides a foundation for more intense study. Overall, Ellis has created a fantastic biography that I would recommend to anyone interested in early American history."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"Too much of what is \\"known\\" about George Washington is based on myth rather than fact. This book strips away the glossy veneer and paints a portrait of a remarkable man who, despite his flaws, influenced the path that our early nation took more than any other person. Despite its relative brevity, this well written biography provides much insight into Washington. We learn how his business and personal dealings led to his disaffection with England and his support for the revolutionary cause. We see the evolution of his views on slavery. We understand how indispensable he was in establishing a strong and \\"energetic\\" (to borrow his words) federal government.

It covered areas of his life that other biographies often don't, such as his early life and the period between the end of the wars and his election to the Presidency. What was especially interesting is that the author lets you see how Washington matured from an impulsive, hot-headed young office during the French and Indian Wars to the mature, innovative leader of the Continental Army. He also gives an honest review of Washington's views on slavery and the native population, which were not as callous as some but not as enlightened as others of the time. Some of the references are a bit academic: I had to look up what he meant by Washington taking the role of a \`Fabian' during the Revolution and a \\"Cincinnatus' in the period after the war. I was also surprised that he did not go in depth on the main events of the Revolution, such as the Battle of Monmouth and the betrayal by Arnold, but he may have felt these areas are well covered elsewhere. In all this was a very informative and enjoyable book that will give a better understanding of the character of George Washington."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"Great prospective on The Father of our Country.

Perhaps we will never know Washington the man, thanks in no small part to Washington's own concerted effort that we only ever know Washington the icon, but I didn't find this book nearly as enjoyable or penetrating as Ellis' review of Jefferson in American Sphinx. Ellis works hard to give us a neutral portrait of His Excellency, but the result is as wooden as Washington's infamous (and erroneous) teeth. This is certainly not the book to excite you about Washington, and it's not the book for those looking for an appreciation of what this amazing man accomplished and the crucial centrality of his role in the birth and early success of the American republic.

Finally, there is a biography about perhaps the greatest of all Americans that is both readable and informative. Thanks to Joseph Ellis for writing it! In only 275 pages, Ellis provides most of Washington's achievements, but also portrays him as a real human being, who was sensitive to criticism, aware of his flaws, and learned from his mistakes. As in his biographies of John Adams and Thomas Jefferson, the author succeeds in painting a character study of a founding father, but unlike the other men, Washington was incredibly successful in two domains--as the commander of the Continental Army and as President. Ellis gives us an appreciation of the options that Washington had in both positions, and the choices he made (most of which seem excellent).We also get a good idea of his major relationships--particularly with Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson. The first one was very close for most of Washington's life, culminating perhaps in their work on his \\"Farewell Address.\\" The latter one deteriorated, with Washington furious with Jefferson for condemning his leadership and even his mental faculties. One relationship that is not explored much by Ellis is the one with Washington's wife, Martha. This may be because she destroyed their correspondence after he died.However, we do learn a lot about Washington's ideas and actions about slavery. Not only did he believe it to be morally wrong, but he did not even think it was a good idea economically. According to Ellis, Washington changed his views after leading an integrated army for eight years, favoring emancipation afterwards. However, Ellis speculates, it was Martha (who owned most of the slaves), who kept him from freeing any of them until her death. I liked the author's analysis here. He views Washington's actions in the context of eighteenth-century Virginia, not by today's standards: \\"He was, in fact, the only prominent member of the Virginia dynasty to act on Jefferson's famous words in the Declaration of Independence by freeing his slaves.\\" In addition, Ellis shows Washington to be enlightened, overall, in his attitudes and policies about Indians. He fought with them and against them during the French and Indian War and the American Revolution. As president, he met with many chiefs and enacted policies designed to protect their tribes.Although Ellis tells us about Washington's mistakes as a military leader, we also find out that he was a very good judge of men generally whom he selected to advise him and delegated authority well (which he also did as president). Somehow his underfunded army of indentured servants, free blacks, immigrants, and the landless defeated the greatest military power in the world. His soldiers ultimately were victorious because of Washington's decision, against all his aggressive instincts and notions about \\"honor,\\" to employ a defensive stategy with some hit-and-run attacks, because von Steuben trained them well, and because the British generals made some errors at crucial times. Ellis does not provide details about all the battles, but we get a good sense of Washington's wartime leadership.Similarly, Ellis does not detail everything that happened during Washington's two terms as president. Rather he hits the principal challenges and achievements, and emphasizes (as did Washington) the need for a strong national government, with a viable economic policy, a realistic and neutral foreign policy, and with the federal union's authority paramount. Ellis finds Washington's decisions (on the Jay Treaty, the National Bank, and Shay's Rebellion, to name three) to be good ones, based on later developments.It took me only a few days to read this very well-written and insightful biography. Joseph Ellis has given us a flesh-and-blood portrait of a great man, who was pragmatic, thoughtful, ambitious, and knew how to lead. Somehow Ellis did so in one volume--and a thin one at that!"},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"I did little reading about our country's Presidents until recently and, when a friend suggested \\"His Excellency: George Washington\\", I decided to take a look.I was very impressed with how Professor Ellis portrayed Washington.

Discussion about the war for our independence was quite good and provided me with a better idea why Washington did the things he did.If you've read alot about George Washington already, I doubt this book will provide much new. However, if you're like me and knew little about him to begin with, this is a super introduction into the life of our First President."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"I like Joseph Ellis and found this book very rewarding. Washington was the first president who set many of the presidents for our country."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"Being that this is the first biography I have read on George Washington, I can only speak a little to the accuracy of professor Ellis's academia, but it flows in an even-handed fashion and other reviewers have mentioned no major flaws in his text. The work covers his life in full, from childhood to death, picking up quickly with his time in the French and Indian War (since there is almost no available scholarship on Washington's youth). The narrative flows chronologically and is broken into parts: his pre-Revolutionary career, his generalship in the Revolution itself, his retirement, and his eventual presidency. The book drags at times, but Professor Ellis does a good job of hitting all of the main events in Washington's life, and giving enough commentary on the controversial aspects (ownership of slaves and the Federalist vs. Republican debate) that you feel you have a balanced introduction in hand.The author begins by pointing out an interesting paradox and then seeking to explain it throughout the book. Namely, that George Washington was not as skilled a general as his British opponents, was not as educated or experienced, and was not as brilliant with pen and oratory as his fellow founding fathers. And yet Adams, Madison, Hamilton, Jefferson, and Franklin all saw him as their superior. This is indeed a striking observation, and though Ellis paints a great portrait of the man, when the book is done I do not know that I feel any closer to answering why that was the case. In a sense this is not Professor Ellis's fault. Compared to Adams there is little personal surviving correspondence between Washington and those he cared for most (only three letters between him and Martha remain) and so it is hard to see the man as anything other than a caricature. And that is of course was what he wished. The destruction of his personal correspondence and the continuous editing of his own more youthful writing demonstrates his lifelong obsession with making sure that for posterity's sake he was seen as impenetrable and without crease. He did not want those in later generations to see him in an intimate manner.George Washington was not a phenomenal general. He learned as he went and lost more battles than he won. In fact, in modern history no 'successful general' has lost as many battles as he did. He was unquestionably courageous though, often at the forefront of his forces, riding atop his white stallion with sword in hand. Though it terrified his inferiors to see him so exposed, the fact that he was never struck down or injured in battle created an almost god-like aura about him. It came to be believed that he could not be killed. The correspondence between a youthful Washington and his cousin in which he states, \\"I heard the bullets whistle, and believe me there was something charming in the sound,\\" demonstrates this bravado and seeming invincibility that eventually would surround his persona.At his death, he was measured at 6'3\\", making him enormously tall for the time. This, as much as anything, may have contributed to his unquestioned authority. He was always said to be 'a head taller' than anyone else in the room. Combined with impeccable self-control, a quiet dignity (demonstrated in his poise, posture, and dress), known courage on the battlefield, wealth, a clarity of thought best labeled as pragmatism, and physical grace (whether hunting or on the dance floor), he embodied a larger-than-life personality.He also possessed a ego of equal stature. Though he knew that he may lose everything from his wealth to very life in the battle for Independence, he recognized that what mattered most was the way he would be seen by later generations. Though economic and moral considerations entered into many of his large decisions (stepping down from power, freeing his slaves after his death), much of it was done with an eye towards how history would see him. He recognized that he had stepped onto the world stage and all future generations would study and adore him to some degree or another.Professor Ellis does a great job of making it explicitly clear that Washington's greatest contribution to America (once the Revolution had been won), was turning in his commission. His enormous popularity with the populace and Continental Army would have made it very possible for him to take control of the government. He had been granted near-dictatorial powers and yet when the war was won he stepped aside and thus fulfilled so much of what the revolution had stood for. It was this action which led George III to proclaim that, \\"if he does that, he is the greatest man in the world.\\" And indeed, this is an immensely admirable feat, for the lure of power has proved too strong for many men to simply hand it over. And, after being elected our first president, it is admirable that he once again turned over power.In the arena of slavery, there is less to be praised. Because he seemed to recognize the evils of slavery and the hypocrisy of keeping men and women in bondage after fighting a war against that very notion, it is hard to understand why he kept his slaves. Why did he wait until his death to finally free them? Though this was a good gesture (as was the dispersing of his estate), why did he wait? Ellis seems to point to economic considerations and we are thus left with a Washington who seems to only quietly acknowledge the sins of servitude, but who is unwilling to act upon his evolving beliefs. Further reading on my part might be necessary to more adequately understand this paradox.The last portion of the book moves more slowly but is possibly the most important for the evolution of our actual governmental institutions. Professor Ellis outlines Washington's successes and failures as our first head of state. We see his dependence on his cabinet (in particular Hamilton), his desire to avoid war with Britain and France, his evolving views of the motivations and interests of nations, and his belief in a strong central government. This last aspect is probably the most applicable to today, though the comparisons can only be drawn so far (I believe most any citizen today, whatever their partisan beliefs, would acknowledge it is unlikely the founding fathers ever envisioned a Federal government that is as large as ours has become, wether good or bad). As we wade through debates about the role of the Federal government and the authority it is empowered with compared to the states, it is illuminating to be reminded that this debate (though in a more conservative form) was being discussed in just as lively a fashion over 200 years ago.Overall, this is a great introduction to the life of George Washington. Though he still seems distant compared to other historical figures and many of his contemporaries, we get a great deal of information about what he did, if not always what he thought. I did not find the writing as eloquent or impassioned as it could have been, and I found he spoke with an undo level of assuredness on certain points that I know possess academic debate, but it was a good work all the same. I would recommend it to anyone looking to learn more about 'His Excellency', our first 'Mr. President', and the least winningest, yet most successful of our nations generals."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"Though the book was advertised as &#34;new&#34;, it did have a couple of white spots on the cover.

It's for you, the reader to assess. This is an unsettled account. I say to you read it yet I struggle with some reservations.Read it and do your own analysis of what is pure truth and what is the authors interpretation of said truth.After all, the truth is what we crave isn't it?It is however a solid historical account of the life of Washington.

Ellis is an American historian whose specialty is the birth of America. He has given us several books on the leaders of the American Revolution, but his latest historical effort takes on the biggest revolutionary of them all -- George Washington.We all revere Washington as the father of our nation, but in fact he was father, mid-wife and nurse practitioner of the American democratic experience. After all, Washington was not only the commander of the Continental Army that won the revolutionary war against Great Britain, he followed that historic role up by overseeing the constitutional convention and then became the first president of the United States.But don't count this as a history book. It isn't. Rather it is a penetrating look at Washington -- the man, his personality, his motivation, his ambition, and his outlook on life and his fellow countrymen.In fact, this book is best read with a good history book at hand, so that the reader can refresh his knowledge of particular American events. Ellis gives short shrift to major mile stones along the course of American history.Want to know about the climactic battle of the Revolution at Yorktown? You won't find details in this book. Nor will the reader find details of the Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798 -- a peculiar series of laws that have particular relevance to the jingoism so prevalent in American today. So this reviewer's recommendation is to have a good American history tome at hand as you read Ellis' book (we can recommend \\"A Leap in the Dark: the Struggle to Create the American Republic\\" by John Ferling) so you can brush up on events that played a central role in early America.That said, Ellis' study of Washington is a first-rate look at what drove Washington to serve such a vital role in the birth of our nation. The reference to \\"His Excellency\\" in the title of the book is an effort by Ellis to define precisely what role Washington played in our history. After all, when Washington assumed the role of Commander of the Continental Army, there wasn't even a government, let alone a democracy. Same thing when Washington was drafted to oversee the Constitutional Convention. Washington didn't become president until after the first election, and it was difficult to define the man's place in the revolution.He could have been a King, according to Ellis, but Washington would never accept such rarefied characterization -- it was not in keeping with the democratic tradition that Washington was helping to build. Ellis settles on \\"His Excellency\\" because there was probably no man who had greater respect among his peers in those days than Washington. There was something just plain excellent about Washington's character, his manner, his carriage, so Ellis settles on that designation.Despite all his successes, however, Washington was not a totally effective leader. He had failings, according to Ellis, and his two biggest ones involved minorities in the new country he helped to create.The first involved the fact that Washington had ownership of some 300 slaves at his farms surrounding his home at Mount Vernon. And while Washington acted \\"conflicted\\" about slavery in a democratic state, he never really came to terms about what to do with his slaves. His inclination was to free them, for both moral and practical purposes (his slaves were, quite simply, too expensive to maintain). But he never came to grip with a solution to the slavery issue. Indeed, he only gave his slaves their freedom in his will after his own death.The second minority issue has particular relevance to modern day events in Connecticut: Native Americans. From the start, Washington worried about what to do about the Indians that were being displaced by the arrival of the colonialist settlers. Indeed, soon after he was elected president, he shepherded legislation through Congress that provided for the young nation to recognize the sovereignty of the various Indian tribes that existed in his time. Indeed it was that legislation that modern lawyers used to win sovereignty for dozens of American tribes that enjoy such status today.Yet, as Ellis notes, Washington's policies toward Native Americans were, essentially, a failure.As he left office after his second term, Washington penned an open letter to the Cherokee Indian tribe, the largest Indian tribe at that time that said:\\"I have thought much on this subject and anxiously wished that these various Indian tribes, as well as their neighbors, the white People, might enjoy in abundance all the good things that make life comfortable and happy.\\"Concludes Ellis:\\"He saw the Cherokees as perhaps the best hope for making his vision of sovereign Indian enclaves within the United States a reality. If the Cherokees would continue to do their part, Washington promised them that the federal government would enforce the treaties honorably so as to assure Cherokee survival as a people and a nation. Washington described his commitment as a matter of law as well as a personal promise. He meant every word and the Cherokees responded by accepting it as the sacred vow of the retiring White Father. But despite his sincerity and personal commitment, this was one promise that even Washington could not keep.\\"In Washington's time, especially after his death, the states could not accept sovereignty for the Indian tribes because Indian sovereignty conflicted with state sovereignty, and state's rights were an essential part of the American democratic experiment. Today, even as the Indian tribes are trying to assert their rights, we are finding that the clash in tribal and local interests is generating controversy and unrest in local communities. And one has to wonder whether Washington's solution to the Indian -- sovereign Indian enclaves -- is ever going to work."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"Joseph J. Ellis kept in mind while writing \\"His Excellency\\" that there could only be one man to fit in the shoes of a democratic government (as we know it) and it was George Washington. I also learned so much about the greatness of this man and how he had to overcome such criticism and failure before changing how people live not only in the US but in the world.This book pretty much let's you know that Washington was not perfect by any means. We was living and working for the ages. He wasn't a great General either, but he tested the hand of time and defied it in many ways.I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"I somehow made it to 41 years old without reading a full biography of the father of our country. This book by Joseph Ellis is an excellent source for getting up to speed on George Washington. Ellis tells the story of Washington in an engaging, accesible way, that non-historians or Washington scholars will appreciate. He does not bog down in minutia, but gives us enough details to get at the full measure of Washington. This book has inspired me to read more about our founding fathers, particularly more about Washington and Alexander Hamilton."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"This was an exellent book about an amazing man of which we owe our country too. Mr. Ellis' writing as that of a great story. There were parts in this book that were very moving to me personally such as Washington's retirement as commander in chief and his life after the presidency. This book provided a clear conception of knowing Washington personally. I was very pleased with the many writtings regarding slavery and how this issued was a very dividing one that Washington decided to table for years as it would have ripped the infant nation apart as it had done during the civil war. It was good to see how Washington did struggle with this moral issue ultimatly freeing his (legally owned) slaves upon his death. Many precedents were set by Washington's first term. This book gives great insights of the politics and early party formations at the beginning of our democracy. This autobiography gives a very good picture of Washington's leadership skills during the Revolutionary War. And it gives insights as to why Washington turned to independence after trying so hard to emulate English aristocracy before the War - namely economic reasons. It gives details of his early life and personal love affair and his wife. It showed how Washington, an uneducate man primarily learned through his failures and experience to become a great leader. It speaks in lengths about Washington's strengths and weakness. One thing I found was how Madison and more so Jefferson were villified as betraying Washington in his second term as president. This is a great read about one of over most important figures in US history usually forgotten about."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"Ellis does what not many have done with Washington; he has made him accessible to the average American.

Why did the leading contemporaries acknowledge that George Washington was superior? Although Washington pondered the realities of power on the ground and was obsessed with control, I hesitate to accept the claim that ideals never controlled Mr. Washington's agenda. In July 1776, General Washington remarked that the Continental Congress was deliberating on a matter of the utmost importance- the Declaration of Independence. Someday I hope to peruse Mr. Washington's early prose work, The Journal of Major George Washington. He sounds like such a complex man."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"\\"His Excellency; George Washington,\\" by Pulitzer Prize author Joseph J. Ellis makes it very clear that if it were not for Washington...infant America would have died in its cradle. In the eloquent and precise words of the author, \\"Washington launched the American ship of state and contributed his personal prestige as ballast on its maiden voyage.\\"On that note, Ellis documents Washington's early Virginia life, his lack of a formal education and his dangerous military service on the Indian frontier. He also carefully explains how General Washington lost more battles than he won but intelligently realized that the two growing institutions of the emerging nation; the Continental Congress and the Continental Army...that the former be subordinate to the latter. Moreover, Ellis details that at the ideological level, Washington instinctively understood the core principle of Republicanism...that all legitimate power derived from the consent of the public.The author goes to great lengths to explain Washington's natural integrity, \\"the exceptional character of George Washington...for refusing to regard himself as the indispensible steward of the American Revolution.\\" According to Ellis, \\"No one entered the office of the President with more personal prestige than Washington, and only two...Abraham Lincoln and Franklin Roosevelt...faced comparable crises.\\" However, Ellis points out that Washington failed an important test by holding people in slavery in Mount Vernon.Still and all, \\"no one else in the founding generation could match Washington's revolutionary credentials and no one else could plausibly challenge his place atop the American version of Mount Olympus,\\" according to Ellis. Overall I was particularly impressed with the research that documented Thomas Jefferson's character assasination and political betrayal of Washington and how Alexander Hamilton attempted to use Washington for his own political gain in the last years of his life. Ultimately, this text will show how Washington was first in war...first in peace...and first in the hearts of his countrymen. Highly recommended.Bert Ruiz"},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"They were giants. Franklin, Paine, Hamilton, Madison, Jefferson, Adams, and Monroe. Names synonymous with greatness. But if they were the rock stars of their time, George Washington was Elvis, Mick and the Beatles rolled into one. Standing six feet three inches, athletically built, well bred and handsome, he could have come direct from central casting. But, while he never lost site of the benefits of form, this was truly a man of action. When others fretted about French/Indian incursions in the Ohio territories, farmer Washington took up arms and became Colonel Washington, the citizen warrior. When the British moved to occupy Massachusetts, he again left his beloved Mt. Vernon to lead men into battle. Lead here is the operative word. Through the discerning eyes of Joseph Ellis, a historian who can also write, we glimpse the human inside the monument. A reluctant warrior, Washington is more wily Fabius than bold Caesar, more Eisenhower strategist and less straight-ahead Patton. But, if Allied Commander Ike had his hands full with Patton, Monty and DeGaulle, imagine controlling uber-egos like Hamilton, Franklin, Adams, Jefferson and Madison. Even during their most virulent political battles, Jefferson, Adams and the rest knew His Excellency General Washington was the headman. Yet, the capstone of his greatness came not when the general ascended to His Excellency Emperor Washington but when he became simply Mr. President."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"One reviewer here stated, \\"George Washington is portrayed as a self-centered egotistical maniac who slaughtered thousands of people (American soldiers) just to satisfy his personal goals and pride.\\" That is false. While Ellis somewhat dwells on Washington's alleged negative traits and places him at times in an unfair light, he does not portray our first president as an \\"egotistical maniac\\" or anything remotely close to it. Ellis's book is Washington light, but upfront he tells us that is his purpose. As to conjecturing, it is true that Ellis makes educated guesses but less so than William C. Davis in his bio of Jefferson Davis, a man who is far better documented than Washington. The fact is that Martha burned her husband's letters after his death and denied the world a personal view of the father of our country. Some guesswork by historians is inevitable because old George did not wear his heart on his public sleeve. This work does not contain all the known facts about Washington, but it is worth reading."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"A superb book.

I especially appreciate biographies that give me a view of history through the lives of the major players. George Washington was truly a man whose life was the centerpiece of the Revolutionary War, the Constitutional Convention, and the birth of the American Republic when the \\"ship of state\\" sailed on her maiden voyage. I loved the book. I could not put it down--and there are few biographies that have this kind of appeal for me.Joseph Ellis did a masterful job of opening up, for me, the life of this great man of divine destiny. Though he was far from perfect, George Washington was certainly the right man in the right place at the right time. It is apparent that he was brought to his place in history because he possessed the very talents and character traits required for the job that needed to be done. I recommend this book very highly to anyone who wants to gain a better understanding of our great first President, the times in which he lived, and the significant role he played in launching and preserving our great Republic."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"Lets face it: Washington is a boring figure. He wasn't a great orator nor was he fascinating by any stretch of the mind. He wasn't even a political genius BUT he was a great leader and leadership is exactly what our early nation needed. What makes Washington interesting is that he recognized this very fact. He was surrounded by some of the most brilliant minds to have ever lived all of whom deferred to him (Franklin, Jefferson, Hamilton, Madison, Adams, etc.). To say the least, he remains an unrivaled leader in the annals of world and American history.From a historical perspective I would imagine that Washington is a difficult figure to write about given the lack of historical records that exist pertaining to his early life. Despite this inevitable setback, Ellis succeeds at bringing Washington to life and helping the reader comprehend who the father of our nation truly was and what made him tick.In addition to being a great leader, knowing when to step aside after two terms and in doing so setting a precedent that lasted up until FDR, really made Washington a hero to later generations. (Washington's precedent lives on with a Constitutional Amendment limiting Presidents to two terms.) When one considers that Washington easily could have been crowned king of America but chose not to be, he easily could have been thrice elected; but refused to run again, you have to admire him for giving sacrificing power, which we all know is not easy to do.Naturally every American should know about this man, and this is one of the best biographies of him in print.Washington also prohetically left future Americans with his hopes for the future of our nation when he penned his Farewell Address. Until relatively recently, Congress would read this into the Congressional Record every Presidents day. Perhaps their current disregard for it's brilliance is what has lead America into it's current foreign melee (Iraq).A great read!"},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"One of the interesting things you see in all of the reviews on this book is that people either found it fascinating and gave it 4 or 5 stars or, to a much lesser extent, found it an offensive attack on Washington and gave it 1 or 2 stars.The latter is notably interesting given that Ellis' assessment of the man was very high, casting him as the greatest of the Founding Fathers. I find it easy to understand a negative reaction, given that many of the anecdotes on Washington are rather unflattering. He was largely a failure outside of his ambitions as a careerist and was motivated mostly by what you'd call self-interest or greed/vanity, depending on how favorably you view that kind of impulse (in this book, it is a virtue).What is more difficult for me to see, is the connection between Ellis' assessment of Washington as 'the greatest' in light of the facts he presents. Washington's role throughout the book seemed to be summed up best in the lines starting the last subchapter of 'Introspective Interlude': \\"Washington was simultaneously the most important person at the Constitutional Convention and the least involved in the debate that shaped the document that emerged. His importance was a function of his presence, which lent an air of legitimacy to the proceeding that otherwise might have been criticized as extralegal, if not a coup d'etat.\\"Was Washington THE Father of the Founding Fathers or an ambitious pawn to Revolution who became a tired pawn to Federalism? Ellis VERY clearly sides with the first analysis but gives such a rounded and fleshy view of each situation that you can form some dissent based on just the information he provides. The truth, as seems to often be the case, is probably somewhere in between, although I will need to read somebody else's account of Jefferson before I make up my mind (to clarify, Jefferson is cast as the evil anti-Washington).Ellis gave me a vibrant start to looking at the issue and enough of both sides to want to investigate it further. And that is a testament to his professionalism as an historian."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"Joseph Ellis in his latest work, His Excellency, brings forth the character and life of George Washington in a shortened, but informative way.

As a commander, nation buidler and gentleman, Ellis' Washington jumps off the pages and never lets the reader go.Read this one."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"I was very disappointed with the disrespect shown toward George Washington. If you remove the negative comments made by Ellis about Washington, the book would be shortened by one half. Throughout the book he makes accusations about Washington's motives. According to Ellis, almost every decision that Washington made was based on some sort of arrogance, pride or self-esteem issue. And all of this coming from a man who lied about his own past and was severely reprimanded by his employer. Washington was beloved in his own time and now. I certainly understand that people have their flaws...and Washington was no exception. In the final analysis, this was a slander of Washington's character - I would definitely not recommend this book."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"His Excellency George Washington attempts to free Washington from the frozen icon/monument status that has gathered around his name, and presents him to the reader as an approachable, flesh and blood portrait. Joseph Ellis accomplishes this goal admirably. Most notably, he manages to steer cleanly between Charybdis and Scylla, avoiding the twin errors of portraying his subject as a saint, or its opposite, which he describes in his prefaces as \\"the deadest, whitest male in American history.\\" He accomplishes this in a modest 275 pages, which makes this book an ideal introduction for someone beginning to study the life of Washington.The central thesis of this work is that Washington's amazing career was driven by an enlightened self-interest, tempered by a hard-earned practical wisdom. Always sticking closely to the available evidence, Ellis shows us a young Washington full of unbounded ambition for wealth and social status that he learned to control and temper, but never eliminate. Ellis writes that, \\"ambition this gargantuan were only glorious if harnessed to a cause larger than oneself, which they most assuredly were after 1775.\\" He shows us Washington as a self-educated man, not from books like his illustrious contemporary Ben Franklin, but from practical, visceral experiences of his youth fighting the French and Indians in the backcountry of Pennsylvania. He views Washington's inglorious defeat at the Great Meadows and his miraculous survival of the carnage of Braddock's massacre as critical events that freed him of illusions, and left him a man who viewed the world through practical realities rather than shimmering ideals. This practical education, working on his natural ambition, created the control mechanisms that allowed Washington to serve his nation so long and so well.Ellis writes mainly of the public Washington. He begins the book not with Washington's birth, but at the point in his youth when he first appeared on the world stage. While the short length of the book limits the depth of its inquiry, it does manage to touch on most every important aspect of Washington's public life, including his positions on dealings with the American Indians, and his evolving ideas about the injustice of slavery. There are many other books that can provide more in depth and comprehensive accounts of Washington. This book serves as an outstanding, balanced introduction to the man we call the father of our country, and is an excellent place to begin.Theo Logos"},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"Mr. Ellis has written a succinct and fresh biography of our first President. A previous recipient of the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award for his American Revolutionary histories, he has expanded upon a brief essay of Washington included in his \\"Founding Brothers.\\"This is not an in-depth day-by-day account of Washington's life. For that pleasure, I refer the reader to the definitive four volume set (and 1,800+ pages) published over 30 years ago by James Thomas Flexner. Even Mr. Flexner's one volume abridgement is more detailed (at 400 + pages) than Mr. Ellis' new biography (only 275 pages of narrative).The difference lies in Mr. Ellis' big picture approach and his interpretation of key events during Washington's lifetime. So Washington's love of Sally Fairfax is restricted to a mere two pages and his estate at Mount Vernon gathers more ink than his tranquil marriage to Martha. Instead \\"His Excellency\\" focuses upon the impact that Washington's decisions had upon the course of American history. Overall this is a well-written and thoughtful introduction to the life of George Washington."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"In the preface to this ambitious and largely successful biography of George Washington, Joseph J. Ellis sets the tone by calling his subject \\"America's greatest secular saint\\" and \\"the Foundingest Father of them all.\\"That puts the biographer's problem nicely. Washington is so universally revered as well as so distant from us in time that he is more marble than human flesh. The biographer's task is to somehow breathe life back into a monument. Ellis has a good track record at this sort of thing. Most recently he did the trick with Thomas Jefferson in AMERICAN SPHINX. His work on Washington is in somewhat the same vein, and is equally accomplished.Ellis's approach sails close to the dangerous shoals of psycho-biography but never quite runs aground on them. In trying to fathom Washington's true character and motives, he sticks fairly close to the written record without presuming to peer inside his subject's head.His conclusions are not always those that today's schoolchildren find in their history texts. In the narrow tactical sense, for instance, Ellis judges Washington no great military genius. He points out that Washington lost more battles than he won, he was a control freak and a man very conscious of his place in history. Despite this \\"posing for posterity,\\" however, Ellis is favorably inclined toward his subject because he had a career \\"devoted to getting the big things right.\\"That career, of course, had two separate parts: military commander and --- after four years in retirement --- our first President. Ellis links the two by stressing something not much emphasized by other historians: The job of establishing the new nation was made infinitely more complicated by the memory of British colonial rule, which had bred a general suspicion of any strong central authority. Washington knew that without a strong central government the new nation would probably fail, but he had somehow overcome the popular hatred of governmental \\"tyranny\\" and even the dread specter of \\"monarchy.\\" He was able to accomplish this balancing act mainly through the sheer veneration in which he was held by the vast majority of people. In Ellis's apt phrase, Washington was able to \\"levitate\\" above the partisan battles of his time.Ellis finds Washington's military experience on what was then America's western frontier (western Pennsylvania and the nearby \\"Ohio Country\\") during the French and Indian War a crucial experience in forming his world-view. It gave him a grand vision of an American western-oriented destiny that stayed with him into his Presidency. He even thought erroneously that the Potomac River, which flowed placidly past his estate at Mount Vernon, might be the water gateway to the riches of the American interior.Another issue that Ellis illuminates is that of Washington's attitude toward slavery. His letters show that he was in favor of eventual emancipation by slow and easy stages --- but also that he needed slaves to keep Mount Vernon from sliding into bankruptcy and ruin. There was an uneasy balance of morality and economics in his thinking.Ellis is also interesting --- if obviously partisan --- in assessing the infighting among Washington, John Adams, Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton during his presidency. Jefferson in particular comes off badly here.One minor cavil: Ellis is so concerned with Washington's public career that he largely slights his private life. Martha Washington, for instance, is merely an offstage shadow in this book. Ellis is, however, a vivid and engaging writer. The Washington he recreates seems almost like a normal human being in many respects. That is about all we can ask for at this distance in time.--- Reviewed by Robert Finn (Robertfinn@aol.com)"},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"When it is seen that popular historian Joseph J. Ellis has written another book about a personality from the Revolutionary War era, excitement fills the publishing world. When it is seen, though, that the subject of his book is George Washington, the question comes quickly to mind, \\"Do we need another book about George Washington?\\"After having read Ellis's book, the answer would seem to be a less ambiguous than you would think, \\"Well, no.\\" There is no \\"new\\" information about Washington here and very little noteworthy insight.From the introduction, we learn that there have been many biographies of Washington. Some of them, like the tales of an early nineteenth century parson, were pretty fanciful (the \\"cherry tree incident\\", the dollar across the Potomac), while others were quite factual and scholarly. The only thing that could be said against this second group seems to have been that they were exceedingly long and, possibly, dry of read.Such cannot be said of Ellis's work. Ellis is an excellent and engaging writer who could write a book on the local city council's discussion of noise abatement and leave you hoping there's a second volume. He writes with warmth and humor and all those other buzzwords so frequently misapplied to writers and I can truly say I enjoyed reading the book.With so many other works on Washington already out there, it was left to Ellis to try to find some new angle with which to chronicle the Father of Our Country. With all the facts recorded (almost ad nauseum), what angle could he use? Ellis has chosen to explore the \\"character\\" of George Washington.It takes Ellis 274 pages (plus some end notes) to determine that Washington was aloof. Or, at least, his personal correspondence (of which there are apparently reams and reams) is rarely ever personal. From this is drawn the assumption that Washington was a distant fellow. Added to this impression are those things written about him by his contemporaries, who still seem to keep him (or allow him to keep himself) at arm's length.George apparently wrote many letters to his beloved wife Martha but she, as was deemed appropriate for the time, burned all those letters after his death. Is it possible that other letters, those deemed more personal than public, were treated similarly by other people George wrote to? Martha's fire makes the news because a] she was his wife and b] there was so much fuel for the conflagration; but perhaps there were many other such personal letters that met the same fate but have not made the news because they were scattered singly among many friends. (This may be a completely unwarranted and unfounded guess on my part.) Only Lafayette seems to have kept anything like personal letters from Washington, so we need to ask whether he was the only one to receive them or just the only one to preserve them (if Ellis asked this question and received an answer, it's not in the book.)This is just one illustration of what I see as the overall problem with this book (and, indeed, with almost all works about people dead more than a century): judging a person's life back then by today's standards. Perhaps Washington was aloof and distant, or maybe that was just the public persona and in more intimate settings he was quite different (he was known, after all, as an excellent dancer and frequent attendee of balls). The mores of the time, however, would have precluded anyone he didn't volunteer the information to from asking.Early or even contemporary, biographers may not have had the sheer volume of material to peruse that the modern historian has, but they also had-for good or bad-a sense of the times that the modern historian can only guess at. Washington's treatment of slaves, makes a good for instance. We look at slavery from our modern perspective as an unquestioned evil and can't imagine how anyone-a Christian especially-could put up with it. I admit I find the subject so horrible as to be unfathomable-rather like permissive murder (oh, wait, we have that in our society). So it becomes easy to look at things from our perspective and see Washington's possession of slaves as barbaric when, by the standards of his times, he was way out in left field because he treated his slaves so much better than what was common among Virginia's landed gentry. Maybe Washington-who was an extremely astute businessman who died wealthy (unlike Jefferson and some of the others)-just took care of his slaves because it was good business to keep one's business assets in fine working order (as Ellis suggests), or maybe he was beginning to see the Negro as a person but had not yet made the leap past his times to set them free (until his death). From our perch two centuries later, it's hard to say with anything like certainty what the man truly thought about slavery and the worth of people with different colored skin and it may be folly to try. Still, his actions, even Ellis seems to grudgingly admit, were progressive for the times, if not progressive enough for our times.Ellis also assumes from the fact that Washington eschews the name \\"God\\" in favor of terms like \\"Providence\\" that Washington was not a particularly reverent person and maybe not even a Christian (owing that he didn't often go to church). This is at odds with other biographers who see, in Washington's hand-written prayer book especially, a deep and abiding reverence for God and his word. Again, it is possible we are trying to look backward from our century in which worship of God is mentioned by every candidate and determine whether a man in an age when even the ministers hesitated to invoke God's name in a sermon for fear of accidentally violating Exodus 20:7 were agnostic or extremely reverent.If you are looking for a detailed biography, go to your local library and pick up one of the probably two dozen offerings they have. If you are looking for a primer on the life of George Washington that can be read (and enjoyed) in a couple sittings, \\"His Excellency\\" by Joseph J. Ellis is a good place to start. Just don't stop there."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"What I found most impressive about this book was not just what Mr. Ellis said, its what he *didn't* say. The book is well-written and very concise -- 285 pages. It is perfect for a casual reader with interest in the founding of the United States of America and the one man who did the most to bring that founding about. It is not a massive, thorough, meticulously footnoted tome. It is a great read.I particularly enjoyed the way Mr. Ellis looks at Washington with a modern eye while remaining grounded in the knowledge and culture of Washington's time. Ellis treats Washington's relationship with slavery and and native Americans critically but fairly. He shows Washington's growing realization of the immoral nature of slavery, and his conversion from a pro-settler position as a plantation owner to a policy of creading homelands for native Americans (which was, of course, undone by the evil hand of Andrew Jackson).Ellis brings the view of modern historians to the much-studied first president, when interesting. My favorite passage in the book is from page 86: \\"Historians have long known that more than two-thirds of the American casualties in the war were the result of disease. But only recently -- and this is rather remarkable -- have they recognized that the American Revolution occurred within a virulent smallpox epidemic of continental scope that claimed about 100,000 lives. . . A compelling case can be made that [Washington's] swift response to the smallpox epidemic and to a policy of inoculation was the most important strategic decision of his military career.\\"This is a very accessible and insightful book that should be read by every American, and indeed anyone, with interest in this nation's founding father."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"I was fortunate to review an advanced copy of this book, and was captivated by its straightforward and accessible descriptions of George Washington. While we all remember what we learned in school, because I was overseas I think what I learned had very little to do with the actual person.What this book does exceptionally well is capture the emotions and convictions Washington held. Too often he is viewed as a caricature or an icon, as opposed to a great leader of people who had his own doubts, fears and journey. This is the side of George Washington we need to see more of.While not as detailed as recent works on John Adams and Ben Franklin, the letters and commentary are worth the effort. If you are at all interested in American history, then this is a wonderful introduction to one of the founding fathers of this great nation. Well done, highly recommended."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"Joseph Ellis' \\"His Excellency: George Washington\\" is a well done brief biography of George Washington. Washington, surely, could be the subject of one of those massive bios, such as Chernow's \\"Alexander Hamilton\\" or \\"Titan\\" or Nasaw's \\"Andrew Carnegie\\" or Cannadine's \\"Mellon.\\" On the other hand, not all biographies need to be so massive. Ellis' work is insightful, provides a sense of Washington the person, and outlines the growth of his character, as he controls his ambitions. In 275 pages, we get a pretty good perspective on \\"the father of our country.\\"This biography tries to steer a middle course between two different approaches to Washington. As Ellis says (page xi): \\"In Washington's case the arc moves from Parson Weems' fabrications about a saintly lad who could not tell a lie to dismissive verdicts about the deadest, whitest male in American history.\\" In placing him among other of the Founders, Ellis makes, I think, an insightful point (page xiv): \\"It seems to me that Benjamin Franklin was wiser than Washington; Alexander Hamilton was more brilliant; John Adams was better read; James Madison was more politically astute. Yet each and all of these prominent figures acknowledged that Washington was their unquestioned superior.\\" By the way, lines such as these make me scratch my head as to the critics of this book who attack the author for denigrating Washington. Parson Weems and his fantasies should not guide our consideration of Washington. He was a human being, not a demigod. And this book demonstrates why we should hold him in high esteem (while also realizing his human foibles and weaknesses).In his death and afterwards, Washington also demonstrated why he stood apart from other Founders. Jefferson was uncomfortable with slavery, but did nothing about his discomfort. Washington was uncomfortable, and worked to free his slaves upon his death. His will represented (page 263) \\". . .his personal rejection of slavery. As we have seen, he had been groping toward this position for many reasons and for more than thirty years, more gradually than we might prefer, more steadily than most of his fellow slave owners in Virginia. He was, in fact, the only politically prominent member of the Virginia dynasty to act on Jefferson's famous words in the Declaration of Independence by freeing his slaves.\\"The book provides a straightforward narrative of Washington's life. From the travails of his youth, to his efforts at developing a trade (e.g., as a surveyor), to his effort to becoming a military officer (culminating in both disaster and reputation in the French and Indian War), to his involvement in debates over independence in his own colony (Virginia), to his accession to general in the Continental Army, to his holding the army together under straitened circumstances, to his role in moving toward a Constitutional Convention, to his service as the first President. Noteworthy is the treatment of his learning to be the primary military commander during the Revolutionary War. Early on, his instincts told him to be aggressive; a number of defeats followed from this. Given the context of the war, this was not a winning strategy. He learned to be more careful and, following a more Fabian strategy, grew as commander and ended up triumphant at Yorktown.In his conclusion, Ellis notes that Washington had a towering ambition, a foul temper, and, understanding this, Washington fought to contain both of these characteristics with his single minded strength. He left office after two terms as president when he could have stayed on. He stepped down as General after the Revolutionary War when he need not necessarily have behaved as Cincinnatus. As a result, he set an example that reverberated through the next century of American history.This is a nice, although brief, rendering of Washington's life. The author makes nuanced judgments of Washington as a person and his legacy. As a result, he comes across as more than a cardboard caricature and as someone who genuinely deserves our respect and appreciation. As Ellis concludes (page 275), \\". . .he understood that the greater glory resided in posterity's judgment.\\" Unlike Napoleon, Caesar, Mao, and Cromwell, he did not hold on to the end, thus eroding his historical reputation and his ultimate effectiveness to the country that he had helped found."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"Joe Ellis has written another book on par with American Sphinx (his Jefferson biography) and Founding Brothers (history of the events and men who created the Constitution). Ellis's best feature is ability to condense great amounts of historical material and reduce it to an interesting and managably sized book that gets across certain major points.Ellis answers questions that I hadn't known the answers too. Here are a few he deals with:1. When and why did Washington become convinced a Revolution against Britain was necessary?2. Why was Washington picked to head the Continental Army.3. Why did Washington join with the federalists and support a stronger federal government than the one created by the Articles of Confederation?4. What did Washington think of his contemporaries such as Hamilton and Jefferson?5. Why did Washington free his slaves in his will?Its an insightful book and some of the things one learns are quite a surprise. One example is the fact that colonial forces almost lost the Revolutionary War and were on the verge of being defeated almost up until the time of Washington's victory over General Cornwallis at Yorktown in 1781. Washington was quite conscious during his life he would be a very famous man after his death and took many actions to protect his historical reputation. Washington deliberately said and wrote little because he felt he could lead more by appearing to be neutral and non-committed on many issues.This is not a detailed comprehensive biography. Its a medium length book designed to hold the reader's interest and educate him/her about a number of significant historical points. A good choice to get a good overview of George Washington and his most significant accomplishments."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"I was extremely disappointed in this book. This book was purchased as a gift for me, and I looked forward to reading it. From the beginning, I was disappointed by the tone of the book, which casts a subtle negative tone on the life of someone who I revere greatly. As I researched some of Ellis' sources, I found that in several parts of his book, he stated items as facts that were completely false.Ellis, following a popular trend of today, insinuates that George Washington was in love with his friend's wife, Sally Fairfax, and that he felt passionately in love with her throughout his life.Ellis admits that all we do know is based primarily on three letters Washington wrote to Sally (Fairfax). The last letter he cites was one Washington wrote near the end of his life. Mr. Ellis states that \\"in this letter, he confessed to an elderly Sally that she had been the passion of his youth, that he had never been able to forget her, 'nor been able to eradicate from my mind those happy moments, the happiest in my life, which have enjoyed in your company.\\"I decided to research his references, and look up the text of Washington's letter on the Library of Congress website. They have actual images of all of the original letters of George Washington. What I found relieved me greatly and set my mind at ease. It also made me feel disgusted than an author who claims to accurately represent the life of such a noble man could be so purposely deceptive.The actual letter was written by Washington in his later years, with his wife. He talked about how he was remembering the times of harmony and friendship that he and his wife spent with Sally and her husband at their home. He describes these times as some of the happiest of his life. At the end of his part of the letter he says \\"Mrs. Washington is about to give you an account of the changes which have happened in the neighbourhood and in our own family.\\"Mr. Ellis said that in this letter he confessed that she had been the passion of his youth. That is simply a blatant falsehood.Ellis also states that there is no evidence to show whether the relationship between Washington and Fairfax ever crossed the sexual threshold or not. I ask, why even include such a ridiculous statement that makes people wonder? It is akin to saying that although someone spends some time at the local bank, we don't have evidence to show whether they were a bank robber or not.There is a popular trend in our country to try to insinuate that the framers of our Constitution such as Washington, Jefferson, and Franklin were immoral men.In an excellent book \\"The Rewriting of America's History\\", I found an example of how deceitful this influence can be. The book explained how in an earlier edition of a school history textbook it stated that George Washington had a hot temper that he kept masterfully controlled. In a later edition of the same textbook, it simply said: \\"George Washington had a hot temper.\\" I think that is a powerful example of how a subtle adjustment can completely change our thinking of his character.I have found that this is happening more and more frequently in our world today as I have studied the founding father's lives including Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, and others.I could continue on with how my research contradicts the opinions of Mr. Ellis, but I will simply recommend a much better book. \\"The Real George Washington\\", published by The National Center for Constitutional Studies.A favorite quote of mine, from LDS President Gordon B. Hinckley is: \\"We recognize that our forefathers were human. They doubtless made mistakes. Some of them acknowledged making mistakes. But the mistakes were minor when compared with the marvelous work which they accomplished. To highlight mistakes and cover over the greater good is to draw a caricature. Caricatures are amusing, but they are often ugly and dishonest. A man may have a wart on his cheek and still have a face of beauty and strength, but if the wart is over emphasized in comparison to his other features, the portrait is lacking in integrity.\\"That sums up how I feel about this book. It attempts to cast a negative representation on the father of our country.You can look up the other \\"one-star\\" reviews of this book for more information."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"As an avid reader of history, I must say that G.W. was one person who I knew almost nothing about.

I've never read any substantial biography on G.W. in order to compare it, but I was impressed with his theories and summations on G.W.'s thought process during the French/Indian war, revolutionary war, and presidency. But I don't know too much about G.W. to really appreciate this type of book. It's more of an analysis into the mind of G.W. then a concise biography. Don't get me wrong here. He seems to cover everything one would need to know, but I could've done without so much psycho analysis and more facts.If you want a general idea of the man without the mind stuff then read something else.

We get a concise yet descriptive story of Washington's entire life, from his beginnings as a soldier in Virginia to a national icon in the mold of Cincinnatus.Wonderful start for those looking to begin wading through all the recent Revolutionary War era biographies!"},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"Joseph Ellis is making a career of publishing concise studies of the great Revolutionary generation. In his prior studies of Jefferson and Adams, he has aimed for psychological penetration in the setting of providing an overview of the figure of interest. This book on Washington is a little different. It is arranged chronologically covering the major features of Washington's life. Ellis does include an attempt at psychological insight but I am not sure that he does much better than most conventional biographies, or the discussions of Washington in Middlekauf's excellent survey of the Revolution, The Glorious Cause. That said, this is a fine concise biography. Ellis is a fine writer and made a strong effort to look at Washington with relatively fresh eyes by basing this book primarily on a careful review of the now almost completely published Washington papers. The book provides a nicely balanced overview of Washington's life, covering all the major phases of Washington's life, and interspersed with an appropriate amount of personal detail. As much as possible, Ellis quotes Washington's own words, but in a way that doesn't overwhelm the narrative. Washington continues to be a remarkably impressive person, the one indispensable man of the Revolution and early Republic. Washington's self-possession and rectitude, his combination of idealism with respect to goals and clear-eyed pragmatism with respect to means, his considerable intelligence and remarkable political judgement, were crucial to generating the world in which we live. While Washington's reticence (even in his diaries, and his potentially revealing correspondence with his wife was destroyed at her death) is an obstacle to understanding his psyche, Ellis gives a very good idea of the world and ideas that formed Washington, as well as describing his remarkable achievements."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"Martha Washington destroyed a lifetime of correspondence when she burned all personal letters between her and her husband after George's death. I cannot believe that his letters to her were as aloof as his orders issued on the battlefield or as tight-lipped as when he presided over the Constitutional Convention. Ellis's book digs as deeply as it can into the persona of Washington, mostly in relation to how he dealt with the complex issues of his time (slavery, Indian affairs, rise of political parties) and the precedents he set as our nation's first commander-in-chief and president (namely, knowing when to step down). GW's diary kept track of weather and plantation-related planning more often than his thoughts. But Ellis does the best he can with the material available to him.Not much is known about Washington's childhood, so we are formally introduced to him around the age of 18, as he surveys land west of the Allegheny mountains. He eventually leads a Virginia regiment in several disastrous battles of the French and Indian War, under the guidance of British generals. His relationship with British military men and entrepreneurs is discussed at several points throughout the book. Why he chose to later go to war against Britain can only be interpreted from his actions leading up to 1775, but Ellis paints a detailed portrait of the colonies and Washington's state of affairs at the time. Later, when presiding over the Constitutional Convention and serving as President, he defined the executive role as delegating tasks to talented associates, so I found the earlier part of the book when Washington was in action much more interesting.Overall, I enjoyed reading this exploration of Washington's life and career. Ellis shows how GW earned the title of His Excellency by first rising above the fray on the Revolutionary battlefields and then remaining an icon that held a young nation together during some of our most turbulent times."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"What I most enjoyed about this book, in addition to the fact that it reads with the ease of a good novel, is that without going into too tedious detail, it takes us into the times, places and situations of George Washington's life in a way that we can experience his growth from a man primarily interested in his place in aristocratic society and history to a man who puts aside his own personal interests in order to see to the successful creation of a new nation and to setting the nation on a course to survive the many trials he foresaw. The chapters dealing with his presidency and the the political battles between the Founding Fathers that led quickly to the formation of political parties are most informative and help demonstrate just how truly important this man was to navigating through the nasty waters of petty (and not so petty) politics that could have easily caused the quick end of the nation. The descriptions of the behind the scenes fighting between Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton, and how James Madison and others used journalism of the times to attempt to shape public opinion against Washington and his pro-Hamilton, central government philosophy are excellent. The examples and explanations of the shrewd but subtle handling of the infighting and issues by the President leave the reader with a better appreciation of why this man was so well respected by his fellow Founding Fathers and the national citizenry at the time, and why he deserves to be held in such high esteem today."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"The book graphically brings out Washington's greatness. From his early years as colonel of the Virginia militia through his service as Commander in Chief of the Revolutionary Army, his Presidency of the Constitutional Convention and his service as our First President, elected by two unanimous votes of the electors, Washington becomes flesh and bones. The wooden man that we all remember from school suddenly is human. And he walks out of the book, truly a great man, head and shoulders above the founding fathers, all of whom were great in their own right.Anyone who loves this USA will come to understand that one man deserves much of the responsibility for what the US has become.It is apparent that the result came from the slimest of chances. The colonies were vastly diverse and the central unifying characteristic was their admiration for Washington. I came to the conclusion Washington was the binding agent that more than anything else held this nation together.This book presented the facts leading to that conclusion."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"George Washington is the most important figure in American history. For nearly forty years, he was the center of American public life. He literally carried the Revolution and the founding of the Nation on his back. To do justice to his many achievements, it requires a multi-volume biography.Joseph Ellis has a lot of history to jam into this modest sized biography. This book reminds of a college lecture because Ellis hits on all of the key points but does not have the time to flesh out too many of the more subtle details. Although, I know very little of the period, his analysis of Washington's personality and career strikes me as being accurate. Having finished the book, I feel that I have a good understanding of his many accomplishments. However, I can't say that this biography left me satisfied.This is not a book for those readers who love the old fashioned, almost panoramic scope of a well written traditional biography. In this slender volume, there is not enough room to add the subtle details and background information that add weight and substance to the best biographies. Beyond a doubt, Ells is a competent historian but in the end he lacks the novelist's eye which the best biographers posses."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"This is not the usual biography, which seeks new original source material and catalogues facts and events. It is an attempt at portraiture of the most reticent of our forefathers. Ellis explores the mind and emotions of Washington through his known actions and known information about him from his own words and those of others who were there with him. What is the nature of his greatness? Why was he the right person at the right time? What did he contribute to the beginnings of our country? There are struggles for Ellis, such as Washington's attitudes and actions regarding slavery. But there is a real excitement in that struggle, the uplift of Ellis trying to fathom the inner workings of this great man at this unique time in our history, with its unique needs.Washington emerges from this exploration as a man of vision, of experiential intelligence, of physical courage, and of undiminishing dedication. At one and the same time, Ellis succeeds in penetrating the mythical ikon while not faltering to sometimes-fashionable denigration or apologetic idealization. By doing that, he makes Washington vivid, and however imperfect, most admirable.It does, indeed, establish one criterion by which we might judge our current political leaders. It does, also, help define who we are as a nation by seeing more clearly this aspect of our origins. It does, finally, make one proud of that heritage, and thankful for that blessing."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"Ellis gives modern Americans a much-needed look back at America's first president. Instead of a legendary and near-mythic overview of a Founding Father, we get the everyday life of a very human man with ordinary human fears and failings. Washington was a modest man who shunned fame and only assumed positions of leadership in the military and politics out of a strong sense of personal duty. Highly recommend for any student of history, fans of biography, and casual history readers."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"Now that I have completed and sent off my absentee ballot hopefully to elect our 44th President, it feels like a good time to go back and review our first one with this insightful biography. Author Joseph Ellis builds an intriguing psychological profile of George Washington that goes well behind his mythology replete with powdered wig, wooden teeth and a cherry tree honestly chopped. As a result, Washington comes across as a rather impersonal man with natural leadership ability, a controlling tendency and a questioning moralist. In other words, he would have fit right in as a 21st century politician.Through meticulous research newly catalogued at the University of Virginia and also through some of his own speculative abilities, Ellis delves into Washington's formative experiences, romantic life, sources of wealth, and evolving repugnance toward slavery. His bitterness toward the British is also explored in great detail and apparently, it started when his status as a vast landowner was diminished by shrinking prices for his crops relative to the soaring profits realized overseas. It's interesting to see how the author concludes that the economic angle provided much of the impetus for driving Washington's leadership in the Revolution. But this is not an expose...Ellis does not debunk Washington as a war hero, as his description of the Revolution is revealing, especially as he describes Washington's gift for rallying soldiers under the most dire of circumstances, specifically the mythic Valley Forge of the winter of 1777-78. Nor does Ellis shortchange Washington's ability to shape the unprecedented and undefined role of a U.S. President, uniting a group of bickering states and herding them toward national unity. But the most interesting part of the book is when Ellis addresses Washington's moral dilemma over slavery. Even more than Jefferson, Washington was a man who felt great guilt over owning slaves, and Ellis describes vividly the arrangements he made to free his slaves after his death. Surprisingly, little is discussed of his romantic relationships either with Sally Fairfax or his courtship and eventual marriage to Martha Dandridge Custis. Regardless, this book gives me a greater appreciation of Washington as a man as well as a myth.

An inside look at the thought process, ideals, and character building experiences that ultimately played an integral role in laying out the foundation of the place we call America."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"The modern \\"pyschological\\" biography attempts what is probably an impossibility: to penetrate and elucidate the core \\"personality\\" or \\"character\\" of an historic figure. The danger that the resulting portrait may be a novel masquerading as a biography, a creation of the author rather than a rendition of the subject, is great. Still more so when the author has clear psychological quirks of his own, and a contemporary political axe to grind. When he also has formidable literary skills, the danger of creating a cogent, compelling lie is acute. This is certainly so in the works of Joseph J. Ellis. He has admitted telling lies about his alleged role in the Vietnam War, demonstrating that his own character and personality are not wedded to the truth. Stranger still, in light of the content of his self-aggrandizing fabrications, he is an avowed political liberal. Something very odd was going on in his own psyche. More recently, he has written that the political vision of Barack Obama accords with that of the Founding Fathers (or, as Ellis calls them, the \\"so-called founding fathers\\"). There are thus multiple reasons to be skeptical of Ellis' several attempts to psychoanalyze the Founders. In this volume the patient on the couch is Washington. It is altogether too convenient that Ellis' Washington is a man whose primary impulse is to seek control in all things, but above all in the attempt to control his own reputation (or, as we might say, his \\"image\\"), both for contemporaries and for posterity. That's the psychology; as to the politics, Ellis' Washington is the Founding Liberal, prescient in his perception of the need for a strong national government that would curb the rights that Jeffersonians, and today's conservatives, regard as reserved to the states and the people. According to Ellis, the psychology and the politics are linked: Washington's belief in a strong national government was an external projection of his inner control. As is typical with this sort of work, any behavior or pronouncement that departs from the general \\"insight\\" is just the exception that proves the rule. Ellis even manages to turn Washington's Farewell Address, with its admonition against foreign involvement, into a harbinger of Kissingerian internationalism. Although this book is well written, indeed a joy to read, and is superficially convincing, I am deeply suspicious."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"His Excellency is less a comprehensive biography about George Washington (which has been superseded by Chernow's recent work) and more a lengthy character essay. Like most of Ellis' other works, His Excellency is fast-paced, flamboyant, and packed with irony and metaphor - all of which makes for a fun read. Ellis' major sin, in my opinion, is his tendency to draw conclusions out of mere speculation, sometimes out of bias. My greatest complaint is his assertion that Washington requested to be buried three days after his death because he may have thought Jesus Himself was buried alive. Regardless of what one's views are of Washington's faith, this is an absolutely bogus assumption with no evidence to corroborate it. Additionally, Ellis at times condescendingly criticizes Washington for exaggerating the strength of his army or its performance during battle. What Ellis fails to note (and what Chernow explains more objectively) is that Washington's army lived in the constant danger of disintegration. Had the truth of the strength of his army been exposed, he could have lost troops to mutiny or have been left vulnerable to attack by the British (wanting to pounce at such an opportunity). Although Ellis writes in an engaging style, do not be fooled by his prejudices and condescensions."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"When a friend told me about the book I was really interested in buying the book.Glad to see that Amazon had it and decided to take chance when it was notated \\"Used\\".When I got the book, it was in perfect condition!

Ellis concludes that virtue is only as good as a person's actions. He pays particular attention to Washington's struggle with slavery and the United States relationships with Native American tribes."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"Ellis has proved his worth as a writer with this amazing work. He senses what the reader wants to know and delivers. It's as if he found the most interesting facts about the life of George Washington, ranked them in order of interest, left in only the best stuff, and then reassembled the facts in chronological order.While I do agree with another reviewer here that the whole Fairfax thing seems to be following a trend of making up sexual rumors concerning historical celebrities, I would say on the whole that there's no reason to doubt the authenticity of the information in this book. It really paints a marvelous picture of Washington as a powerfully influential and honorable man. He's a true American hero, and my attitude towards him is no longer indifferent. He was really the greatest military leader in American history, even though most of us don't think of him all that much as a military man.And what's really fascinating is he didn't even want to be president. He wanted nothing more than to be a man of arms. Yet he served two terms against his will and endured hateful opposition from Thomas Jefferson's political party. Surprising how many similarities party politics at the founding have with party politics of today. And then you've got Hamilton thrown in the mix of the party squabbles causing all kinds of trouble. I tell you, the brief biographical information concerning the man on the $10 bill is like an added bonus thrown in with the complete bio of the man on the $1 bill. What a deal Ellis has given us!"},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"Joseph Ellis has written a modern, balanced, short biography of George Washington. Ellis points out Washington's strengths which made him the most respected of America's Founding Fathers by other revolutionary leaders such as Adams and Jefferson. But he also points out some of Washington's weaknesses; these included an excessive concern about his image and limitations as a military tactician. Ellis writes very well and reveals much about Washington's character and personality, giving a more human portrait to a man who often appears cold and impersonal.A key aspect of Washington's personality as revealed by Ellis is that he actually had strong passions which he worked very hard to master. Ellis then links this aspect of his personality to key political decisions Washington made such as retiring from the Continental Army after the revolutionary war was won and refusing to serve a third term as President.It is worth noting, however, that this is a fairly short biography of Washington at 275 pages (not counting notes and index). So, the claim of the book's jacket that it \\"is sure to become the authoritative biography of George Washington for many decades\\" seems exaggerated. I think \\"His Excellency: George Washington\\" is a very good introduction to our first President but expect that there is much more to learn from longer biographies."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"Several years ago I decided to read at least one biography on every US President. Hearing a short lecture about Washington at a museum was a big catalyst for my decision. Here was a man that had transcended humanity in so many minds to be more of a iconic symbol of our nation's birth and it's ideals. I wanted to learn more about the person - not just the icon.Ellis' book is the second biography I've read on Washington. (John Ferling's is the other.) While there is certainly plenty of personal interpretation on Ellis' behalf, there's also plenty of reality.I know some readers are put off by this. They want to remember and recognize Washington for the great man he was and deem any attempt at adding to that picture as sacrilegious. I disagree. I think seeing a more complete and flawed image of the man himself makes him more accessible. Washington is no longer this man way up there on a pedestal that we can never connect with or identify with. He's a real person that did some amazing things in his life because of his integrity and his fortitude. Nothing in this biography (or Ferling's for that matter)takes away from that. For me, today sitting on the other side of the cover of these two books, George Washington is a real human being that had his faults as well as his strengths. He's a guy that capitalized on what he's good at and who was able to hold together an infant nation of wildly diverse people's simply because of who he was and the leader he was. Washington isn't less of gifted leader to me after reading this book - in fact, seeing \\"all of him\\" makes him *more* of an awe inspiring man."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"A marvelous read of the genesis of our great nation!!

The bad? The author does, as a previous reviewer states, seem to presume quite a bit regarding how G.W. was feeling or his innermost thoughts. The revisionist claim is merited, in my opinion.Overall, a very nice read, though. The first half seems to be a treatise on how and why Washington was not as great as we think he was, but the second half really shines a good light on him. Perhaps the complimentary tones of the second half carry more weight because of the rather unflattering tones of the first half. Note -- the \\"half\\" divisions are of my own creation and do not reflect actual chapters or divisions created by the author."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"I felt the book is a fair portrayal of Washington as a human and gives the reader a new insight into the person. Mr. Ellis tries to take a man which has become a myth in his own time and deconstruct him to see what makes him tick. What did he find; Washington was a man like any of us, making his decisions based on what's good for his bank account, and putting in strategic moves for the future. We must remember that in that time people put in work to collect decades later, unlike today.This is an overview of Washington's life, the important decisions he made and why did he make them. Mr. Ellis' research is well founded; his speculations and premises make logical sense and put a new light on old tales.Are Mr. Ellis' assumptions correct?Who know, but isn't that half the fun or reading history books, to make your own assumptions, theories and hypothesis and see if the author agrees with you.Don't be afraid to read this book, you will come away with a great appreciation and admiration to Washington because, not despite, he was a human being and not a super-man."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"In \\"His Excellency\\" Author Joseph J. Ellis provides the reader with an interesting and thorough life of George Washington. Without boring the reader with details, Ellis covers all the highlights of the Washington lore. We travel along on the disastrous first military excursion to the west and to the Massacre on the Monongahela. The advancement of Washington's military career with his command of the command of the Virginia Blues, the depths and heights of the Revolution and the essential but rocky presidency are all explained to the reader.Ellis does a very good job at integrating facts into the themes of the book. In explaining the economy of the farms and Washington's speculation in western lands he shows how Washington's personal economics contributed to the evolution of his self-image from that of an Englishman to that of an independent American.Another well developed theme is that of the combination of Washington's genius to know the nature and timing of what was needed from him and the character to deliver it. Perhaps his greatest insight was to know how and when to exit, from the Army, the Presidency and the Society of the Cincinnati.Knowing how the story ends, we tend to think that it had to play out as it did. This book shows how the story could have ended sooner. Washington's reputation could have been destroyed by his bungling in the French and Indian War. He repeatedly teetered on the brink of defeat during the Revolution. Often he taunted death and barely escaped with fallen mounts and bullet pocked clothes. At the successful end of the Revolution, Washington's public service appeared to be completed. With his family medical history and the state of national development, political service seemed an unlikely prospect. While we think of Washington as the unchallenged leader, Ellis demonstrates that the tradition of a rocky second term, along with many other presidential precedents, started with him.As Ellis establishes, for many of us, Washington is an icon. Ellis brings him to life. He shows us Washington's uncertainties and failures. As we see Washington's failures we wonder how he ever became a success. As we read on, we understand how this stumbling, learning soldier and statesman provided the leadership necessary to establish the nation which he envisioned. For anyone with a desire to know the real George Washington, \\"His Excellency\\" is an excellent choice."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"Joseph J. Ellis's book \\"His Excellency: George Washington\\" does so many things right that I would have to say that it is one of the best historical books that I have ever listened to. (As a history buff, I have listened to, and own, MANY historical books on CD, as well as in print). I just finished listening to it for a second time and enjoyed it even more on the second listening. This book is clearly academic and scholarly in presentation, demonstrating a powerful command of the English language, without ever sounding ostentatious. Ellis's style isn't overly flowery or too plain. His writing style is clear, carefully worded, and detailed in all descriptions.Ellis's analysis of Washington is presented from a neutral point of view. This is not an overtly glowing review of Washington, nor is it overly critical. Ellis strikes the balance simply by presenting the facts at face value, without injecting too much of his own interpretation of those facts. I learned more, collectively, about George Washington the man: George Washington the Military leader and George Washington the Statesman from this book than from any other book about Washington or the American Revolution I have read or listened to.I came away from this book with a greater admiration for George Washington and better insight into the \\"real man\\" (faults and all), precisely because Ellis presented the historical facts (good and bad), without embelishment or biased selection of source material. In other words, Ellis didn't just choose to present \\"all of the good stuff,\\" on Washinton, while quietly sweeping the dirt under the carpet. There is no hero worship in this book. However, any American with an appreciation for the extraordinary odds that were overcome, in the American Revolution, will likely finish this book with an increased respect for George Washington. Any person, American or not, will likely finish this book with an increased appreciation for Washington's integrity, commitment to cause and strength of character. The reader will also appreciate how Washinton struggled (successfully) to control his temperment, ambitions and destiny.I loved this book! The reviewer (from McLean, VA) who could not get past hearing the narrator take audible breaths and hearing his (the narrator's) stomach grumble, had me laughing to the point of tears. Yes, you can even hear the narrator licking his lips, though I did not find any of this particularly distracting. I found the narrator's pace and emphasis on certain words to be quite good.I look forward to re-listening to this book many more times. I give it 5 stars for: content, style and overall presentation. I give it 4 1/2 stars for the narrator's delivery and editing. Highly recommended for anyone seeking an in depth review of George Washington's life and anyone who has an interest in the American Revolution."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"Ellis' book makes the life of Washington come alive. The narration on the CD is well done. Worth your time!"},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"Fresh of his success in \\"Founding Brothers,\\" Joseph J. Ellis gives us a fresh look at George Washington. In, \\"His Excellency,\\" Ellis seeks to strip away the mystical legend and take a good look at George Washington, the man. Ellis succeeds admirably in doing so. And in so doing, he picks up on themes he began in \\"Founding Brothers\\" including the major theme of the meaning of the American Revolution. The only weak point of the work was Ellis' introduction which I found to be a bit rambling and apparent stream of consciousness.Nelson Runger provides the narration for the work, and just as Runger did in \\"Founding Brothers,\\" his work here serves to both elevate and make accessible Ellis' history.

This is a highly accessible, well-written introduction to our chief Founding Father that is honest and well ballanced. Washington is presented as often arrogant and as making mistakes based on a rashness of character linked to a perhaps inflated sense of honor. The flip side of this analysis is that it makes clear that this great man, complete with flaws, was uniquely gifted and dispositioned to play an inimitable role in the shaping of our early national identity. Real hero, real flaws...isn't that to be expected in a book about a very real George Washington? Some of the other reviewers need to lighten up and get real!"},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"Joseph Ellis is a learned, competent Revolutionary era historian. While this book is a fine introduction to Washington's role in the Revolutionary War era and beyond, it doesn't approach the caliber of David McCullough's John Adams or Edmund Morris' The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt. Ellis seems to lack the sympathy and insight necessary for a good biography. He doesn't seem to understand Washington - he doesn't get us into his head, relying instead on historical narrative. Ellis also misses opportunities to bring out more of Washington's character. Admittedly, part of the problem of interpreting Washington is that Washington manipulated his public image, acutely aware that it would endure to all generations. The Great W. was scrupulous about his private life. But rather than admitting this paucity of information and pointing to the gaps in our understanding, Ellis attempts to paper it over. His prose style, attempting conversation, yet creaks with scholarly habit.I bought this book, relying on the stellar recommendations here on Amazon, but it seems I must wait for a great tour of the mind of this great leader."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"His book starts out with a British allance on the far western bourders of the western most colonies.

IN he prayer jouranl he specifically diplays himself as a Christian and names Jesus Christ as his savior too many times to count. I would recommend people read William J. Johnson's George Washington, the Christian."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"The thing that stands out as being most erroneous in this book was the beleif that Mr. Ellis has that Washington was not involved in the practice of slavery in any way on his own volition. According to Mr. Ellis, the slaves on Mount Vernon were his father's, his brother's and his wife's, but not his, and he had no authority to free these slaves, even though he privately opposed slavery. Mr. Ellis supposes that Washington opposed slavery, even though he shows not evidence to support this other than the fact that he did not work his slaves. In his book, Mr. Ellis has submitted that Mount Vernon ceased to be a working plantation not due to Washington's advanced age and possible exhaustion, but due to Washington's opposition of the practice of forced labour.I also found it very interesting that Mr. Ellis took pains to make Washington at times a deist, agnostic and even an atheist. Once again he submitted no hard evidence for this, but it is inferred from from the fact that Washington was not the most proliferative writer of theology of the Revolutionary era. Since Washington never wrote a major work of religious philosophy on the subject of Christ he must had not believed in Christ seems to be the opinion of the writer. But if Washington did have religious views outside the norm for those days, why didn't any of the numerous rivals that Ellis mentioned bring those beliefs to light? It was well known the Jefferson used the press to attack Washington, and Adams when he viewed them as political rivals and not as friends, but he never mentioned their faith.I also take issue with the idea that this book depicts Washington as a bloody-minded general in the mode of Grant, and not as a man who learned his limitations as a military leader. Washington seems to have come to the realization that he was no field commander, but was far more effective in the role of the face of the resistance, and Commander-In-Chief. Furthermore, due to the ineffectiveness, and questionable loyalty of his officers, as well as the loss of his men, he felt the need to commit to a very limited number of engagements in the war until the French military arrived, but Ellis feels as though Washington jealously held on to his commission at the expense of his men with the aim of enhancing his own glory. Washington's firm belief that the war would be won by the French military, and the French economy was missed by Mr. Ellis, but most other scholars have accepted this as a fact.Mr. Ellis seemed to miss the idea that Washington was a product of his time. Generals kept their command until death in those days, there was no transfers, and no reassignments at those times. Southern plantation owners owned slaves in those days, and that was how it was. And lastly, all members of polite society were fundamentalist Christians, even though Mr. Ellis prefer the founder of the United States not be. Maybe I should amend my review to recommend this book to anyone who wants to see Washington as a Liberal Northeastern Politician from the early 21st century , and not as a Christian/planter/general from 18th century."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"This is a good introduction to Washington's life. Ellis' writing style has improved since his debacle on Adams. This is an enjoyable read, though he plays loose with some facts, omits others, and states some opinions as facts as well."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"This book isn't as sketchy as Ellis's \\"American Sphinx\\" book about Jefferson, but still, it shouldn't be read as a substitute for a biography. I know, because that's how I tried to read it, knowing nothing about GW. If I hadn't recently read \\"Sphinx\\" and Chernow's Hamilton bio, I would've had problems.As for Ellis's notion that he's discovering the \\"character\\" of GW, he tries to be a prestidigitator, raising the mystery at the end of his preface and then springing the answer at the end. This is not a good way to write a serious book; he should've been testing out the thesis at every turn. As it is, the bit about \\"Washington's strong passions,\\" etc., makes it into all the reviews, so that the book falls a bit flat.Nevertheless, Ellis is a fine writer (Chernow's bio of Hamilton is a better *biography*, but worse written), and I appreciated learning something about the enigmatic GW. I'd never really thought about the unprecedented nature of GW's stepping down after the war was won. (But while the comparison to Cromwell is apt, Ellis's comparison to Caesar isn't. Caesar didn't rebel against an empire, he rebelled against a republic.)I got this one from the library, and am glad that I did ... and that I didn't buy it! Not deep enough that you'll want to reread it."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"Before 1753, early stories of President George Washington portrayed him as a boy. He was born on 2-22-1732 near the Potomac River. The American Revolution was the central event in the life of President George Washington. While Washington took an army to NY, the Continental Congress moved closer to a Declaration ofIndependence. At Valley Forge, shoeless soldiers tracked blood in the snow. Ultimately, President George Washington crossed the Delaware River by a luge-like vessel.The new President saw the American Revolution as a catalyst for desolution of any vestiges of monarchy in the USA. Constitutionally, scholars argued whether ornot the Articles should be replaced or revised. A strength ofthis book is that the author attempts to discuss constitutionalimplications comprehensively. The work is rich in anecdotes andin the details of the personal lives and encounters of the founders."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"I purchased this book because I was curious to learn more about the man behind the legend. Sadly, I am woefully ignorant of much of the history of my country, other than the broad overview I learned during those long-gone days I was but a youthful schoolboy. Since those who don't study history are doomed to repeat it, I thought I'd better start reading up.I was afraid that the book would would be dry and boring, but I shouldn't have worried. Author Joseph J. Ellis has produced a book that is both informative and entertaining. His style is engaging, witty, and easy to comprehend. He obviously has a great admiration for his subject, but he does attempt to maintain objectivity.The picture Ellis paints of Washington is that of an ambitious, passionate, yet self-restrained man; opinionated but often reticent, aware of his own shortcomings and willing to listen to those with greater expertise. First and foremost, the author describes George Washington as the central, stabilizing force which both drove the fight for independence, and held the fledgling country together during its formative years.All in all, an insightful read, and a rare look into the man himself, as opposed to the historical figure."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"Good not Great. It is a different look at Washington and it is a quick but solid read. If your looking for a fun light read on our 1st president then I would highly recommend it. However, if your looking for an expansive bio on Washington I would suggest Chenrow's novel. I'm currently reading a bio on every president and will most likely read another Washington bio but Ellis did well and he wrote what he intended to write no more no less."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"Having visited Mount Vernon a few years ago, and then reading McCullough's 1776, I became more interested in learning about Washington, the man. I found this book an interesting but somewhat frustrating read.The author does state there is a lack of personal letters of Washington, and in part writes it more like a history than a biography, reciting the events and occasionally trying to draw conclusions as to character and personality. However, it is a bit like a sketch at times. There is a hint that Washington became estranged from his mother, but no follow up on this. Sometimes historical context is mentioned, I think with the expectation that we remember everything from our history classes, but I had to go to Wikepedia to remember the background details of Shay's rebellion, for example. To understand the war and the political environment and Washington's position, I found it helpful thinking back to McCullough's books (even including John Adams).That said, I did learn a number of interesting facts and a timeline of Washington's life from Ellis' book. Washington remains mysterious but there is enough detail to reinforce that he was uniquely driven with vision, ideals, and sense of his place in history as responsible for the shaping of the new nation. Ellis brings out Washington's vision of a nation as one, expanding toward the West, and his sense of timing and prioritization, deference to civil authority and the will of the people, and willingness to preside over chaotic situations as a stable influence, even under duress of being overmatched in war or the attacks on his second term as president. Ellis describes Washington's education by the tough experiences of war, and his physical presence leading his men. He discusses self interest as a partially motivating force -- his land ownership and desire to be free from British authority -- and occasional flaws in judgment. The discussion of slavery explores both its moral and economic unsustainability, and Washington's position in delaying the issue personally and as a national priority. The influence and excesses of the French revolution and ideals of republican vs. federal views are explored, with Washington solidly on the side of national unity under attack from republicans who feared federal power in his second term.He is shown as human being who, from the midst of a battle, would write letters home to advise on building and planting fields at his home. That he would only go into public service when chosen, that he was repeatedly chosen, that he led with strength of character, and that he left when done, paved the way for the freedoms we enjoy today.Better to have read this book than not, so thumbs up."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"\\"His Excellency George Washington\\" is less a detailed biography of our first president than an in-depth consideration of his character and political thought. Nothing about the book seems extraneous; every part of it adds substantively to Joseph J. Ellis' portrait of Washington as a passionate, ambitious man who may have lacked the brainpower and education of other Founding Fathers, but who more than made up for that by his extraordinary leadership abilities, his utter fearlessness, his far-sighted common sense, and his unparalleled insight into people and nations as they are, not as he wanted them to be. \\"Instead of going to college, Washington went to war,\\" Ellis says, and in doing so Washington learned indelible lessons that Jefferson, Madison and Adams, as great as they were, never learned. Washington may have been flawed as a strategist and tactician, but he was a superb organizer of men, and he knew how to maintain both morale and discipline. As Ellis shows us, Washington knew how to use power, and--even more remarkably--knew when to let go of it.Ellis shows Washington to be extraordinary not just alongside the other extraordinary men who formed the United States of America, but compared with world leaders of any era. The key, Ellis tells us, was Washington's remarkable strength of character. \\"(Washington) knew himself well enough to resist the illusion that he transcended his human nature,\\" Ellis writes at the end. \\"Unlike Julius Caesar and Oliver Cromwell before him, and Napoleon, Lenin, and Mao after him, he understood that the greater glory resided in posterity's judgment. If you aspire to live forever in the memory of future generations, you must demonstrate the ultimate self-confidence to leave the final judgment to them. And he did.\\"My seven-year-old niece came home from school not long ago, full of astonishment of the amazing tales she had heard there of how George Washington and his ragged, outgunned, outmanned Army won our nation's independence. Thus Americans have been amazed at Washington for over two hundred years, and will be amazed for hundreds more. As Ellis demonstrates, they are right to be."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"The author tries to break down the character and choices of Washington by entering his psyche. I usually stay away from these types of biographies, but what Ellis does works for Washington, just because there really is such scattered information on him before the Revolution. There was a lot of good information to pick up on here. The writing style is excellent. If you read Founding Brothers, then this is a good secondary source."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"Ellis does an excellent job of getting you into Washington's head by focusing on his personality and providing insightful excerpts from Washington's voluminous correspondence. Rather than focusing on names, dates, troop movements or legislation signed, Ellis concerns himself with Washington's own experience as he marched into history. You really get a good idea of how he felt about fighting a war without a real national government to support the army, the splintering of his Cabinet and the early formation of political parties, or the long struggle of what he ought to do with his slaves at Mount Vernon.The times Washington lived in are also well-illuminated through his experiences. From his experiences as a Virginia planter and his own personal pre-Revolution economic relationship with England, to the post-Revolution concerns of Washington's opponents about a standing army or \\"monarchism,\\" you really get a vivid picture of what the America of the 18th century was like.Through this personal focus and the frequent use of Washington's own words, the man himself really comes alive in Ellis' hands, seeming more flesh and blood than marble monument, and - though as a history we know the outcome - it's as gripping a narrative as any good novel. The narration by Nelson Runger on the audio version is also quite good.If you have any interest in American history or biographies, you'd be well-served by reading this book, and if you like audio books, you won't be disappointed in the audio production."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"I am a fan of Joseph Ellis' and of George Washington, and this book fit with my joys. George Washington has not recieved enough credit for his failures and accomplishments in life and for this nation. Revisionist history paints a much darker piture of Washinton and the founding fathers. but Ellis places Washington in the perspective that he deserves. As Lincoln and the Civil War proved, ending slavery would have caused a divide in this nation that Washinton wanted to avoid, but he knew the wrongs of slavery and attempted to make some rights (his will). I strongly recommened this book because it does not gloss over Washington's flaws, it is a honest history."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"I am just beginning on a mission to read a biography of every US President.

This book fit the bill."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"Great book. Great insight into Washington and his life. Interesting and enlightening..... What? No cherry tree?"},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"A VERY GOOD AUDIO BOOK ON WASHINGTON! BUY IT."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"A lot of the other reviewers have hit on the brevity of this work, the fact that it focuses on topics and themes rather than a blow by blow account of the Great Man's life, and it's balanced approach against making GW a deity or a devil.I've been trying to figure out why I was disappointed with this book, and I think the reason is that GW had such a rich life and was such an \\"indispensable man\\" that I would have liked Ellis' thoughts more developed on such issues as GW's military evolution, his thoughts on the constitutional process, attitudes toward the articles of confederation, and on the presidency of his successor, which is a good thing if you are curious, because this introduction will leave you wanting to find out more.In sum, it has all of the strengths and the weaknesses of an introductory survey. It is intelligent and well-written, and if you are casually interested in GW or want to reacquaint yourself with his story, this is a very good book to read."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"This is an engaging biography that truly takes the icon off the pedestal and chronicles the life of a human being. On finishing the book, I really had a better appreciation and understanding of George Washington the man. To some extent, he resembles David Donald's portrayal of Lincoln as a \\"man on the make,\\" an ambitious individual bound to make something of himself. But as with Lincoln, Washington had a number of fortunate breaks, especially in the Revolution, and Ellis appropriately characterizes Washington \\"destiny's child.\\"Any biographer makes decisions about how much emphasis or attention is given to selected events, periods, and individuals in an individual's life. Here, one is more aware that certain individuals, periods, and events are given less attention. For one thing, the focus is on last 25 years of his life-his childhood, youth, and the French and Indian War period get relatively short shrift. In addition, the focus is also clearly concentrated on Washington himself-most of the \\"supporting cast,\\" including Martha and the other founding fathers, get relatively little attention. (While Hamilton gets a good deal of attention, Jefferson and Madison lesser attention, Adams and Franklin almost none.)Ellis accesses papers that have not helped shape previous biographies, and his portrayal of Washington is far richer as a result. The book presents an extended discussion of his relationship to his slaves and to slavery as an institution as well as the reasoning that led to his manumission of his slaves at his life's end-he was unique among Southerners of the founding generation in this regard. Ellis also deftly critiques Washington's style and decisions as a military leader and as a chief executive.On completion of the book, I found myself wanting more, which is at the same time both a criticism of the book and perhaps the highest compliment one can pay an author."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"First, I would recommend this book to anyone who just loves to consume books on the Revolutionary War and the Founding Fathers. This book was not as good as Mr. Ellis's venerable \\"Founding Brothers,\\" and the \\"American Sphinx.\\" Those books were a delight.1) It seemed in this book that Mr. Ellis did a \\"rush job\\" to meet a publisher deadline. The Brothers and Sphinx books, however, seemed like he really took his time and carefully chose the content.2) Admittedly it is not easy to cram George Washington into 300 pages. However, the hurried up history of the his war exploits left me wanting much more.3) I don't like the way modern authors bend over backwards to detail the foibles of the Founding Fathers or any great man of history. Tell us about their great achievements, brilliance, heroism, and providential placement in history. I don't want precious space taken up in a biography trying to appease the left-wing reviewers with 21th century values. Big deal, they weren't angels.All in all, the writing style was very good, and I didn't want the book to end. Cheers."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"Ellis' book has an interesting premise namely, that there isn't a lot about Washington as compared with others of the period (notably John Adams, who is barely mentioned), that he was an incredibly private person with amazing self-control denying attempts to interpret his thoughts, that he left little in his own hand to provide a glimpse into his inner workings and therefore we need to delve deeply into the intent and motivation of the Father of our Country.In setting this up Ellis has created for himself a real challenge. The key words about Washington are always statements of probability: might, may have, is possible, could be.... and can't get much firmer because the historical record of his own thoughts are so thin.Spending so much time on the inner workings of a man who never let anyone know what he thought could have been either boring ro painful but Ellis does keep the story flowing. He lays out the approach he will take in the first few pages and spends his time defending his own (Ellis') hypothesis about Washington the man versus Washington the hero/god. He does this while continuing to move the \\"plot\\" more or less chronolgically through the 6 decades of Washington's life.When not describing Washington's psyche (and sometimes while doing so) Ellis is a defender (albeit a tepid one) of Washington and seeks in many small ways to defend him against the lashes of his contemporaries (ala Jefferson and Bache). The writing however never becomes passionate. Its energy level always hovers just a bit above clinical analysis.For the reader the challenge is getting the full historical context that allows the arguments to gel. Ellis describes singular \\"incidents\\" in history but does not describe the period itself. There is little if any side discussions of the things going on outside of Washington's immediate view. Thus if the theoretical discussions about Washington's inner man are removed the book would be very short in deed, probably no more than a pamphlet.With that being said the book does provide a much needed summary of Washington the man (versus the slayer of the cherry tree) and does focus on Washington as a true contributor to what we now know as the United States. It eliminates any suggestion that he was a \\"figurehead\\" and leaves you realizing that were he alive today, if not President, he would likely have risen to be a CEO with broad vision ability to delegate and a sense of individuals and groups strengths and weakness.All in all a pleasant read. The book will complement a well versed reader understanding of the man and the period but will does not provide a viable starting point for the study of the 1776-1800 period of American history."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"Professor Ellis delivers another very good book with \\"His Excellency\\". Much can be learned through his research and direct prose regarding George Washington, the founding of our Republic and the War that had to be fought to procure our Independence. However, after his award winning biography on Thomas Jefferson, American Sphinx, this seems a bit short on detail. Perhaps Ellis spoiled us all and the expectations are too high. Equally likely, is that the real information is in short supply on Washington with very few documents surviving and open to interpretation of historians. Very much to his credit, Ellis does not stretch credibility and opines only openly and where appropriate. This is a book that should be read by all interested in this fascinating period of our country's history."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"While it's totally hip to de-mythify things our parents (silly things) thought were good, Ellis's de-mythification of Washington is not satisfying. His basic thesis is that Washington was a nincompoop who happened to be in the right place at the right time his whole life. That's unlikely, and it doesn't explain why Washington was a legend in his own time as well as our own, unlike most \\"mythical\\" legends, whose myths grow in time.Five stars for doing what everyone else does.Two stars for insight."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"Interesting read.

Conversely, my thoughts on Thomas Jefferson are not so nice! Prof. Ellis' work is quite thorough and thought-provoking. He is not content to only report the facts on Washington's life; Prof. Ellis also enlightens you with the character's thoughts so that you can draw a more conclusive opinion.After reading this book, I am forever grateful to Mr. Washington for accepting the responsibilities of becoming the first president of our nation.

Look it up. It's not surprising that a dishonest man like Ellis would seek to tear down the image of a man who had so much to do with shaping the ideals and values of the founding of country.I would recommend the Flexner volume over this or The Real George Washington.

Slow, boring. The writer is definitely a master of the historical facts but his story telling, or lack thereof, left me wishing my book club had chosen another title."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"I purchased this book with the objective of being inspired by the life of one of the greatest heroes that has ever lived and who's legacy of exemplary character has survived the scrutiny of historians and the tests of time.After listening, I could not bring to mind even one positive character attribute mentioned by the author, with the exception of perhaps bravery (and even that was portrayed as reckless and fool-hearted).Although the author doesn't blatantly trample Washington he craftily weaves commentary into the text which leads the reader into believing that history has painted an incorrect picture of our first president.If one were unfamiliar with truth, a reader of this book would come away concluding that Washington was dishonest, selfishly ambitious, greedy, consumed with a concern about his own reputation, rebellious, and vengeful among other things.At one point the author has the audacity to conclude that Washington's hatred for the British and the eventual cause for joining the rebellion against them was a short period of his life in which he was indebted to one of their merchants.This book is nothing more than a liberal's attempt to rewrite history and discredit an extraordinarily honorable man that has served as an inspiration to millions over the past two centuries.Unbelievable."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"I listened to the audio version of the book and found it to be very disappointing both as to the writing itself as well as the reading of the book. Washington is basically portrayed as a self centered arrogant man that is only concerned about his career and bent on making sure that posterity views himself correctly. Throwing rocks at a dead man (particulary the father of our country) is not the type of commentary I enjoy. The reading drips with the same perception, as quotes of Washington express the tone of arrogance and aloofness. From the beginning to the end, I didn't like it."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"Educating ourselves with the history and accomplishments of REAL Presidents is very important.

Times have certainly changed since Washington, and that is the point."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"The book is an insightful examination of George Washington's character. Previous reviewers have been critical of the authors analysis of the sources and seems to regard this as inappropriate. Not only do they misinterpret Ellis' assessment of Washington but they ignore a fundamental role of historians to interpret and analyze their sources. If one is interested only in the facts, then consult the sources in the endnotes. The author's writing is clear and fluid and his judgements reasoned if debateable at times. On the whole, I highly recommend this book as an examination of George Washington, perhaps our most important founding father."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"Drawing heavily from George Washington's own written work, Joseph J. Ellis concocts a fascinating picture of our first president, in the course of which showing how great a man Washington actually was.Washington has always seemed an aloof figure- yes, he's revered as the father of our country, but we seem to hear very little about what he was actually like. This book not only does an excellent job of bringing out the human factor but shows why he deserves his place in history.Through this book, we learn that Washington was deeply committed to the federacy, and that he is quite possibly the only man who could have done what he did as the first president-- walk away after two terms in office. We also learn that one of Washington's greatest strengths was his ability to learn and change his mind. For instance, when he realized that his preferred, aggressive method of attack would not work against the British soldiers, he adopted a strategy of retreating slightly and then regrouping for attack.We learn about his conflicted feelings regarding slavery, and of his conviction that the future of the nation lay toward the west. We also learned that he strongly believed that the Native American Tribes were nations in and of themselves and that treaties with them should be honored in the same way as treaties with European nations.In this book, we see his growth from a young surveyor who is convinced he is destined for greatness, into the bold commander of the American forces who led the toops to victory as much through the sheer force of his personality as anything else. Never before and never again will anyone be so completely revered by the people of the United States-- how many other presidents can say they were unanimously elected- twice? What's even more remarkable is that he was elected to the presidency without campaigning for it- indeed, he turned down the presidency several times before finally accepting it. This book very neatly dispels the idea that Washington turned the presidency down out of a sense of false modesty-- he truly felt he was too old and wanted just to retire to Mount Vernon.The author manages to evince sympathy for Washington; while reading, one is struck by how hard he tries to do what is right, not just for the times in which he lived but for posterity. He was very aware of his place in history and he chose his actions with an eye toward what people would think of him in the future. It is difficult to think of living in such a way that almost every action you take has to be carefully calculated, but nevertheless, that appears to be how he lived.He need not have worried. He may never have chopped down a cherry tree or thrown a coin across the Potomac, but the true story of his life more than outdoes the childhood legends about him. I came away from this book with renewed admiration for the man, and an appreciation for the author who was able to take a remote figure and make him come to life."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"Joseph Ellis has added another distinctive biography to his unorthodox style of writing. Continuing with this method that served him so well in \\"Founding Brothers\\" and \\"American Sphinx\\", he has again provided distinct information about events surrounding the founding of the republic.The method that makes \\"His Excellency\\" captivating is Ellis' ability to highlight events in George Washington's life without focusing on his presidency. This follows the pattern he used in order to write about Thomas Jefferson in \\"American Sphinx\\". Since the accomplishments of both administrations (Washington's and Jefferson's) have been widely written about, Ellis instead focused on other crucial periods in their lives before and after their terms in office. This is important as the reader realizes that Ellis is laying the foundation to discuss the building of the character of the first president.Ellis was successful in covering major events in general terms, without focusing on excruciating detail. This was particularly refreshing as he covered some of the major battles of the Revolutionary War. Naturally, Ellis covered Washington's period as Commander in Chief of the military during the war. However, it was his service for the English Empire as a young officer during the French and Indian War that we discover the early formation of his opinions of the British. Although he did not fully embrace separation from the empire at this time, it is obvious that the policies of the English influenced his beliefs that eventually led to his support for an independence movement.Another interesting characteristic that Ellis brings to the surface is the humbleness of Washington. He surrounded himself with intelligent and loyal officers during the war and wisely sought their advice throughout the conflict. This was a trait that he continued throughout his public life. It was an important factor in the early formation of the new government in 1789 as he sought the opinions of bright, influential public figures, such as Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and Thomas Jefferson.Without overstating his own importance in the formation of the American Republic, Washington correctly predicted the greatness of the nation in its infancy. Ellis wrote about correspondence that Washington had with General Lafayette. He told the loyal Frenchman, \\"There will come a day when this country will have some weight in the scale of empires.\\" Despite the grand statement, you get the feeling that Washington believed more in America's future and in western expansion than in his own contributions.To obtain a unique perspective on Washington's contributions to this country and to world history, read this exceptional biography."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"Over the last thirty years or so there has been an effort among some historians to put a human face on some of the more revered figures in America's history. Many of these historians have pointed out that some of these so-called marble men have been placed on a pedestal so high that they have ceased to be human and on this point they are quite correct. They are also correct in pointing out that once we look at these people as human beings instead of icons their accomplishments are all the more amazing. Unfortunately some of these historians, in trying to correct old myths have decided that the only way to reverse hundreds of years of positive misinformation is to rip their subject's reputation to shreds. And since Virginia has always been very good at promoting it's heroes, three Virginians have come under the most withering fire. Namely these icons of history are Thomas Jefferson, Robert E. Lee, and George Washington.Joseph Ellis, who has written several very successful books has performed this revisionist surgery on George Washington in this his latest book but in a much more skillful manner than some of his predecessors. Yes, Ellis has pointed out his subject's faults and has in particular studied Washington's role as a slave owner but he places everything in the context of Washington's time. In many ways the author shows us just how much Washington grew and changed over time. He learned from his mistakes, which was more than a lot of his more educated contemporaries were able to do and by the time of his death in 1799 many of his ideas were well ahead of their time. Early on in fact, Washington was able to see that the financial system that most Virginia planters operated under was going to trap them under a massive debt. Washington escaped while many other planters, including Jefferson did not.Growing up relatively poor, Washington was obsessed with money and it was that obsession that eventually brought him into conflict with English law. This same obsession also helped him eventually reach his conclusions about slavery for he saw that for Virginia planters the slave system was a loosing proposition. That of course made it much easier for him to begin to see the moral problems posed by the slave system.Washington's other great obsession was his legacy and not only was he apt to make decisions based on what posterity might think, he often went back and edited his papers in order to put his best foot forward. This editing, along with Martha's destruction of their personal letters after Washington's death has made it difficult for historians to really know Washington. Ellis has however done an excellent job of research and I think he has drawn the best picture possible for this work of limited scope. The author writes in a very pleasing manner and this book is written so that anyone with the barest knowledge of Washington's time can not only understand what the author is trying to say but can also enjoy the experience. This is Washington with some of the excess marble chipped away but with the impressive frame of the man left intact. In other words, this is revisionist history the way it should be written."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"Joseph Ellis has a history of being thorough, balanced, and highly readable, and he does not disappoint in his newest offering on the life of George Washington. Ellis acknowledges our country's fascination for either deifying or demonizing our founding fathers, and is able to strike an honest medium. \\"His Excellency\\" allows readers to grasp a general understanding of our first president's humanity. We are able to view him as hero and yet familiarly fallen. This is a great book for those seeking not just an understanding of history, but of the person of George Washington.I became a Joseph Ellis fan from his \\"Founding Brothers\\" and have been rewarded again by \\"His Excellency: George Washington\\""},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"Having studied history in college, I'm usually inclined toward more detailed biographies than this one. In the past, then, I may have rated this lower and called it an uncomprehensive life of Washington. I have learned, however, that not everyone cares to entrench themselves as deeply in a subject as I do, and as such I recognize the extensive merits of this book and can realize that, for someone who would like a casual (but very informative) introduction to our First President, this is just about as good as it gets.That is not to say that Ellis's work is not scholarly. What has always impressed me about his work is the amount of detail he can fit into a short amount of pages. His work is very thorough, yet is not bogged down in detail and is certainly written in elegant prose. In short he succeeds both as an academic and a story-teller in my mind. While this is far from the most comprehensive work of Washington (it DID take Douglas Freeman seven volumes, after all) out there, it is a spectacular biography and a very worthwhile read."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"Perhaps we will never know the man as well as we know the myth. Perhaps we should not. But for those interested in review of the man, the author prevents a very readable, and well researched biography of the first President. From the early ambitiousness, to the frustrations during the war, to the concerns fading heroes all have, this is a terrific overview of his life and times.Tremendously well researched, the author reviews Washington's involvement with the French and Indian war, and how less than spectacular results during this time actually began his legendary status as a hero. Further explored is his relationship with the British that ultimately began his slide from loyal hero to revolutionary. Most interesting for me was the political intrigue occurring towards the end of his presidency. I mean, how does one exactly campaign against such an archetype? Yes, he stated that he would not seek a third term, setting a precedent for generations, but political parties were forming, and campaigning did occur. (I'll never think about Tom Pain the same way again.)But more than the facts and stories, I felt that I was able to get an idea of the man's personality. This is indeed no small feat given not only what Washington did do, but what he did not do, rarely gave in to discussing personal reflection, never left journals with anything other then rudimentary facts."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"Many historians and editors would argue that writing a new biography of George Washington is a questionable endeavor. There are so many well respected and often noted titles available for those who want to know more about our first President that one may question if this is worth reading versus the more proven works.In my opinion, if you want an extremely well written and more concise investigation into the motivations, personality, and inner workings of this living statue, there is no better place to start than His Excellency.Ellis is vivid in his illumination while critical and penetrating in his disection of many of the difficult and complex contradictions of Washington. In the end the reader enjoys one of the most intelligent and sensitive treatments of Washington ever written.If you are an Early American History buff, or long standing student of Washington, this book may be a bit too concise or lacking in a certain volume of detail to satisfy. But if you are looking to read a beautifully written book about our most important citizen, this book is an absolute must. This work is a pleasure from start to finish."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"The author is a well known Pulitzer Prize winner and has written a number of books on American political figures including Thomas Jefferson. Here he presents us with a magnificent but short book on Washington, written for the general reader.There are two things to discuss, i.e.: the book as a book and the story. Some might mildly protest that the book is too short and it is; it is just 275 pages of text and 40 pages of notes plus it has a collection of photos. The book is superbly written. After a short read I found myself already at page 50 and then at page 100 as the pages sped by. It is entertaining, fascinating, and a well written story. It is a pleasure to read and is really a quick light read that can be accomplished in a few days. It is far from being a long and complicated biography. It is an easy to read book aimed at the average general reader, and the author should take a lot of pride in the book.The story is really very fascinating. The author uses a very conservative approach and relies mainly on hard facts and writings from various historical documents. He tries to avoid using Washington's notes that were edited by Washington in the late 1780's to 1790's. The author Ellis does not bridge any gaps with fiction as say Anthony Burgess did in his Shakespeare biography. It is just the facts but superbly packaged in a fascinating story.Since the story is very accurate and relies on the public record, it skips the George Washington childhood and starts with Washington as an officer in the Virginia militia in 1753 fighting in western Pennsylvania, known then as Ohio country. Interestingly, at that time that military action was a disaster but Washington survived with his reputation.The book is a combination of his personal life mixed in with his public life. It is broken down roughly into four sections. First we have the young Colonel Washington fighting the Indians and French in the Ohio valley in the 1750's. This is followed by a brief section on his management of his and his wife's estates in Virginia, and his first encounters in politics. That is the first 60-70 pages and takes to the early 1770's. That experience solidifies his anti British views and leads to his interest in what follows in later years.The third section involves his handling of the war of independence that went on for approximately 8 years until the early 1780's. It starts for Washington with the Continental Congress and his taking charge of the troops in Cambridge, in Massachusetts (near Harvard), after Bunker Hill. The author describes the other figures such as American General Gates and British Generals Howe and Cornwallis, and the turncoat Arnold, and Lafayette etc and he describes the general flow of the war. We read about the loss of New York, the American victory at Saratoga, the dashing clashes near Trenton and Princeton, the misery at Valley Forge, other defeats, the alliance with the French and then the fortuitous victory at Yorktown by the Americans where they snatched victory from the looming jaws of defeat.The last section - that some will think too short - is his role as the first President. He served for two terms and oversaw the defining legislation of the new republic and the construction of Washington DC, as it was later named. We learn briefly about his interactions with Jefferson, Franklin, Hamilton, Adams, and others, and we learn of his views on slavery.All in all this is an excellent book and a fascinating introduction to George Washington, a fighter, manager, and superb politician. As you will read, Washington was not a highly educated person but a self educated manager, general and politician. He was not a talker but let his actions speak for themselves. Above all he was a man of integrity, a seasoned citizen, a business man, a nation builder, a man with a plan, a man of action who rode a big white horse, adored by the people and woe to his political foes. He was voted to the Virginia delegation of the Continental Congress with 96% of the vote and won all electoral votes when he ran for President. Truly an unusual man.It is a must read, and an obvious 5 stars."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"There is a subtle lie promoted in this book. It has to be subtle because to state it plainly would expose the author to the punishment I proscribe in the title. Ellis sublty insinutaes that Washington risked his life, reputation and fortune, and endured unspeakable hardships for the sake of his generation and all to follow (not only in America, but whereever freedom is coveted) all because he was angry at the British for picking his pocket. I am surprised other reviewers on this site don't at least mention it, let alone wail over it. Obviously, Ellis has never suffered, or risked much, because there ain't no way George Washinton was motivated by nothing more than his bank statement. I did give the book two stars because this book is not a piece of trash. Ellis is no fool. I have to give him credit as an author and scholar. Too bad he sees valor as a cover for pecuniary gain. He IS entitled to his opinion, no matter how wrong it is."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"I think this is Ellis' best book. Washington is a fascinating character whose role in creating the United States is indisputable and critical. One of the aspects I most enjoyed in the book was the relevation as to how luck helped propell Washington to greatness. Given today's sorry cast of national politicians, it's amazing that so many great persons came to the fore during the Revolution and immediate aftermath. Ellis presents a fair portrait of the man - both good and bad. Certainly it's mostly good. It's a shame that Washingotn and many of his contemporaries do not today receive the attention and credit they deserve. Chalk it up to a failing education system."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"If you've never read a Joseph Ellis book before, it may be a bit surprising to find out that his books are far less about biographical information as they are about analysis of the person in question. Therefore, as with his previous examinations of both Thomas Jefferson and John Adams, Ellis ignores a detailed sketch of Washington's life and instead focuses on the events and situations that defined him as a person. I say this because if you've never read a biography about Washington, I encourage you to do so first, before reading this book. It is for two reasons:1) You won't get a complete history of Washington. Many facts about his life are simply left out or summarized leaving you with many questions about what happened between when and when.2) Many of the things Ellis examines are quite fasinating and will only be appreciated if you've read a book about Washington. For example, many an author I have read have spent a great deal of time about Washington's \\"book on manners\\". They have said he drew his character as a person from this book. I have read parts of this book and could not understand why this was, but accepted that axiom for larger minds than myself formulated that idea and that was enough for me. In this book, Ellis, points out very frankly, that Washington, probably used it to practice penmenship. It made me laugh and at the same time made me realize that larger minds aren't always right!Having said this, I would say you are in for a treat. This is a very scholarly and very profound book on Washington. I did more thinking and achieved more understanding than I have ever had in the books I read about Washington. Ellis tears apart Washington and leaves you with a real understanding of Washington, and although Washington was private, I realized that there is enough material there to get a feel for the man. Ellis is a master at this and will leave you seeing Washington not as the legend of folklore, but a man who for many reasons changed into a man that was so desparately needed at the time. He also reminds you that Washington really was an amazing person who fought off the tempting urge to be a Napolean, saving the United States at the same time from being yet another dictatorship.So for those who have always tried to understand Washington from other books and have not been able to really understand the man, just the history, look no further. You will in this book. It is an effort at times to read, but well worth it!"},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"Voltaire declared: \\"it is a gross piece of charlatanry to pretend to paint the potrait of a man with whom you have never lived.\\" Biographies are at best an inchoate description of a life lived, while at worst, they could be a votary's panegyric. Joseph Ellis, thankfully, does not fall into either extremes.No one in the history of the nation deserves more praise and respect than George Washington. Respected, even feared, by his peers, he was clearly recognized as the foremost Founding Father. Every kid remembers him as the commander of the revolutionary forces, as the first president, as the man who freed his slaves upon death. In this book, Ellis is more concerned with investigating how Washington became what he was.His Excellency, George Washington, starts with his life as a youth under the british forces. A couple of sentences suffice regarding his birth and his family. Proceeding from there, we get to view his marriage, then his entry into the war and the politics of the colonies. Finally we are shown his presidency, and his private life, after resignation.Ellis writes a midsize biography that manages to skirt over most details of his subject. The writing is scholarly, with sufficient facts and suppositions. Since Washington was a man of his time, we are provided with a snapshot of the colonial clime---the riotous period before the war of independence; we also get to see him as a general, then as president.We see some snippets of his life: how his lack of formal education made him inferior; how his decision to free slaves was on economic, rather than moral grounds.I was struck by a passage on page 88, \\"Though Washington never wavered---in the end, steadfastness was his most valuable attribute, along with the stamina that accompanied it---popular enthusiasm for the war faded alongside the illusion that it would be a brief affair.\\" (A lesson to the current president: you are not alone.)However, His Excellency manages to fall short. Some of it cannot be blamed on the author because in all honesty, he is writing the biography of a mute. Washington's reticence makes it difficult to divine his thoughtsNevertheless, it was foolhardy attempting to tell so important a life in less than 300 pages. For instance, the incident involving Citizen Genet took about three paragraphs even with its importance. Indeed most situations are brushed aside in this quick read. Furthermore, the brief glimpses at other revolutionaries like Hamilton, Jefferson, Madison, etc do not do justice to the input they provided to sustain Washington's image.Nevertheless, whatever his foibles, Washington must be praised for holding the nation together in its infancy.His Excellency is a excellent truncated account of the life of the man and a nation: General George Washington and the United States of America."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"Although this is a decent short biography of George Washington, it in no way is as complete as Ron Chernow's \\"Washington: A Life\\". To me there are three major deficiencies in this book. First, Ellis makes several references without explaining them. You may not get the reference if you have not read other works about Washington. (Example: Washington's desire to retire under his own vine and fig tree). Second, early on Ellis tosses out the analysis that Washington was not a religious man. He does not provide any substantiation for his reasoning, yet there is plenty of evidence that points to the contrary (see \\"George Washington's Sacred Fire\\" by Peter A. Lillback). Third, Ellis seems to delight in casting Washington in an inhospitable light whenever possible. While I am sure Washington was as human as the rest of us with his own unique foibles, I got a little tired of the tenor in this book.In short, read Chernow's book and skip this one."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"His Excellency: George Washington spans the early years of Washington's exploits as a British officer, his appointment and activity as commander of the Continental army, and his ascendancy to President of the United States. Ellis describes Washington as a privately passionate and publicly reserved persona, bold to the point of recklessness on the battlefield yet an astute observer and delegator regarding political matters.Chapter Six, detailing Washington's presidency and specifically his troubled relationships with cabinet members and fellow founding fathers Hamilton (portrayed as openly ambitious but brilliant), Jefferson (talented statesman and trusted aide who secretly fomented anti-Washington sentiment), and Madison (on par with Jefferson), is perhaps the most informative and engaging portion of Ellis's narrative.Unfortunately, the Kindle version does not support linked Notes within the text, making it nigh impossible to review Ellis's sources and end notes pertaining to each paragraph as you read."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"I purchased Ellis's work on the recommendation of a co-worker. He assured me I would like it; I ultimately found the book interesting, but disappointing. For the casual student of history, \\"His Excellency\\" provides an fine entrance into the world of Washington that helps gently brush away folklore and brings into focus the man qua man. In the end, however, Ellis leaves serious inquirers wanting more as he leaves his thesis question unresolved. What makes Washington the \\"Foundingest Father of them all\\" (p.xiv)? \\"His Excellency\\" doesn't provide a clear answer."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"I liked the idea that the author tried to cover all of Washington's life. I didn't like that he tried to keep it in a shorter format. There was scarce detail about his leadership in the Revolutionary War and I really didn't learn a great deal about how his presidency -- the all-important and precedent setting first presidency -- went. I did learn a lot about the scheming of rivals and the evolution of the two party system, and a great deal about Washington and his thoughts on slavery. I actually learned more about Washington as a military leader from Benson Bobrick's \\"Angel in the Whirlwind\\" than I did from this book. I would have been more than willing to have read a couple more hundred pages, if necessary, in order to gain a fuller picture of the man and his military and political leadership. It was nice that it was not too lengthy, but when you're covering a topic this expansive, sometimes there's hardly a thing as \\"too long.\\" It was a good book, and certainly worth reading, but I can't imagine there's not better resources out there somewhere."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"Joseph Ellis is not for the faint of heart. He writes about washington like a man who has read EVERYTHING washington wrote. That's becuase he read everything Washington wrote...and was written about what he said. Therefore, one must be prepared to display more than a passing interest in Washington to get through this book. Having said that, getting through it is a worthwhile endeavor. In my learning life, I am now officially done with Washington. This book gives a more complete insight into his life as any other I have read."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"His Excellency by Joseph J. Ellis is the compelling and interesting biography of George Washington, the Father of Our Country. I've never really been interested in Washington; he's always seemed like more of a figurehead than a real person. History classes did nothing to change my opinion. But Ellis really brings Washington alive through excerpts of his correspondence and by analysis of his actions. I was telling my husband about the book and his response was that it made the first president seem actually interesting. I agree; Ellis has put flesh and blood upon the statue and made him real. Myths about the cherry tree as well as current political thought that Washington was a patriarchal egomaniac are blown to bits. Washington was a man of his time, but he also created his time and was a necessary figure not only in the bid for America's independence but also in her fight to become a nation. This book gave me new respect not just for Washington but for the other Founding Fathers as well."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"George Washington was a complex man- and became, even in his own lifetime, an icon. However, Ellis, author of the book Founding Brothers as well as American Sphinx (about Thomas Jefferson), does an excellent job of helping us understand Washington as a young officer, a Virginia squire, the commanding general of a revolutionary army and finally the first President of the newly formed United States of America.But Ellis superbly paints Washington's character-- what he was like beneath the surface. First, he found an ambitious man with strong self-control. He explores this self-control and the effect it had on Washington and those around him.Ellis also describes Washington as a visionary who understood, far better than Jefferson & Hamilton, the future of the young American nation. Ellis believes that this is one of the most defining things of greatness in Washington- and I would agree.I have two other books on Washington in my library. This one is head and shoulders above the others and is one of the better books I have read in the past five years."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"I thought Ellis captured George Washington very nicely in his prose. It was well researched giving the reader great insight to who Washington was really all about. Ellis told the truth without hyperbole.If you are looking for a well researched and informative book on the subject this is it."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"Although there are a plethora of biographies out there on George Washington, this is the first one that I have read. I selected this particular titled primarily because I enjoyed the previous book I had read by this author, First Family: Abigail and John Adams. Ellis did justice to this great personage just as I expected that he would.One of the things that I enjoyed most about this book was that Ellis was able to turn the myth into a man. When you think about or read about George Washington there are all of these lofty ideals and mythology that surrounds him. He is the man that made all of the right decisions and brought this country forward when it was struggling to survive. While still keeping high praise on Washington, Ellis brings to us a man who did not always know what the right answer was, lost more battles that he won, and ultimately did not want to be President of the United States. He made the first President much more approachable and someone who you could connect to in some ways - it can be hard when you can't necessarily place yourself into his shoes.The primary focus of this book is Washington's military days. It was appreciated to learn about his time in the French and Indian War and the time before he became President, because you quite frankly can forget that those periods exist with all of the emphasis put on his American Revolution tenure and Presidency. His presidency was featured but not in nearly as much detail as his war days and it didn't feel as if the author placed as much importance on it as these earlier periods in his life.The one thing that I would have liked a little more of was his home life. I think about 2 sentences were spent on Martha and it was only really in passing. I'm sure that there was much more to their relationship. It could also be that not as much is known of their relationship as say John and Abigail Adams because Martha destroyed all of their letters to each other upon George's death."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"I read a lot of history. I've found that no author seems to be able to build a compelling story around our first president. They either stick to the barest facts about his life and bore you to death. Or, circle him and miss the essential question of who he was. Ellis hit the mark. He accepts that Washington was complex and misunderstood. He takes the facts we have, weaves them into the historical context, and leaves you a little closer to knowing the unknowable. If you are new to the founding fathers, I recommend starting with Jefferson, Adams, and Hamilton. After reading about those, Washington's life and times will be easier to grasp."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"Joseph Ellis did a spectacular Job in writting this book.

Joseph Ellis did an incredible job of telling the story of the man's life while attempting to uncover his personality and his driving forces."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"Pulitzer Prize winning author Joseph Ellis has written a probing but relatively concise biography on the iconic George Washington. Ellis portrays the first US President as a man of paradoxical greatness. Washington is seen as passionate yet tremendously self-controlled, ambitious yet frequently reluctant, and aloof yet inwardly tender. The author dispels much of the Washington mythology but confirms the reality of a man worthy of respect.\\"His Excellency\\" is filled with facts and hard evidence but Ellis' interpretations of events leads to much speculation as to Washington motives, purposes and convictions. In so doing I felt the author downplayed the spiritual dimension of Washington's character, which was an important part of the American ethos, clearly expressed in the President's first inaugural address.One of the most inspiring aspects of the book was found in observing the maturing of Washington's character and worldview. His changing perspective on the issue of slavery was just one example of this personal evolution. I thoroughly enjoyed the book and would recommend it to any discerning reader wanting greater insight into the life of one of America's most significant leaders."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"The two foremost biographies of George Washington have long been Douglas Southall Freeman and James Thomas Flexner's multi-volume ones. Both of these have been abridged into one-volume editions. While their full-length biographies are difficult and pricey to obtain, the one-volume editions are inexpensive and easily obtained. Ellis's stated purpose on this biography is to provide a one-volume modern edition that can serve as an alternative to both Freeman and Flexner. He does not attempt to approach the epic scope of the original version of either of their biographies, but he does an admirable job of providing a contemporary account of the life of this most remarkable of Americans.Unlike his biographies of John Adams and Thomas Jefferson, Ellis's biography of Washington provides a chronological narrative instead of a series of character sketches. In those other two books, Ellis was more concerned with analyzing the personalities of the individuals concerned than with an accounting of all or even most of the principle events in their lives. This is a much more straightforward narrative, though even here Ellis is more concerned with the light events through upon the character and make up of Washington the individual than illucidating the role of Washington as an actor in history. This is actually Ellis's strength as a writer: making his subjects emerge as believable individuals instead of hovering as inhumane statues. As a result, Ellis attempts to reveal Washington warts and all, and I have to say that while he does engage in some debunking of the myth of Washington, he makes him all that much more impressive for his actual achievements.Ellis's Washington is a man who is deeply sensitive about how he is viewed and perceived by the rest of the world, as well as someone who is determined not to be taken advantage of economically. This sensitivity, Ellis shows, motivates much of what he did whether as plantation owner, patriot, general, and president. And also as slaveowner. If this Washington is less idealistic than the Washington of myth, he also seems more plausible. Ellis also does a marvelous job of teasing out Washington's political beliefs, which all in all are much less far reaching than one might suppose. Above all, Washington believed in a strong central government, though for reasons that put him somewhat out of step with his contemporaries. Adams and other Federalists believed in the need for a strong central government partly out of the need for a strong federal to protect against irrational forces in society, whether these are generated by ill-informed masses or by economic elites. Washington seemed to sense the need for a strong federal simply because if the inevitability of the nation becoming one. He seemed instinctively to be suspecious of local and state interests. What is remarkable about Washington's convictions was his willingness to be out of step with his fellow Virginians and his belief in a strong federal decades before improved travel would make the physical unification of the nation more feasible. But Ellis also brings out how very little Washington thought about political theory as a whole. Nonetheless, his instincts were remarkable.Above all, one admires Washington for the power he refused to assume more than for what he did with the power that he possessed. In all that I have ever read on Washington--and Ellis's fine book brings this out better than most--he emerges as an extraordinarily remarkable man for his remarkable discipline in keeping the presidency from becoming a version of kingship. This is often remarked on, but it never ceases to impress when given the complete context of his life and the actual as well as potential power that he possessed. No president in American history had as much potential power as Washington. Absolutely no other president in American history grasped so little of what lay at hand. Most presidents want not less, but more power. Washington had as much as he wanted, and yet took so very little. To this day I wonder if we truly appreciate the enormity of his achievement, especially at a time when we have a president who has jokingingly (or is he truly joking?) that it would nice to be a dictator and not have to worry about the popular will or congress.Ellis's biography does not supplant either of the full length biographies of Freeman or Flexner, but it does lay claim to be the finest single volume biography of the past few decades. I strongly recommend it to anyone seeking a biography of Washington, as well as to those who have enjoyed Ellis's other excellent books."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"Washington may be the least understood of our major founding fathers. Most people think of him as a god who could do no wrong. Some modern day academics seem on a mission to tear him off the pedastel.Ellis, however, has set about giving his readers a thoughtful, balanced and readable view of who Washington was, what he accomplished, how he did it and how he thought. As a result, readers meet a Washington who, while not the greatest military strategist and not the greatest intellect, did have the charisma, the ambition, the personality and the intelligence to merit his position in history. He was a self made man who consciously married well, achieved military success against long odds, chaired the Constitutional Convention and pioneered the newly established role of President of the United States.Contrary to the Parson Weems characterization, Washington was not perfect. He was a man with human faults including a tremendous temper and strong ambition. He struggled with the issue of slavery, and, like Jefferson, Adams and others, he was very concerned with how history would view him.Washington was a realist who understood how people and nations behave. He understood the need for a strong central government. He understood when to fight and when to compromise. He knew how to identify talent and how to delegate.In the final analysis, Washington was exactly what the Nation needed and he was willing to gift his many talents to it. He truly earned his place in history, and all Americans should be grateful that he was there."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"I found this biography of George Washington to be very good. It included information on the early years of Washington's career, and was very readable. It was interesting to learn about Wahington's background and his obsession with how he would be remembered in history. If you are looking for great details into Washington's life and career, this book may not satisfy your needs. However, for a concise account of his life before and after the war and his presidecnies I thought this book captured things very well. I would recommend it to all those with a casual and serious historical interest in Washington."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"In \\"His Excellency,\\" Joseph Ellis has written a very readable and concise synopsis on the life of George Washington. Though more recognizable for his works \\"Founding Brothers\\" and \\"American Sphinx\\" (about Thomas Jefferson), Ellis successfully undertakes the task of illuminating probably the most important figure in American history.Probably the most apparent burden struck by Ellis, and a theme readily illusive throughout his book, is the author's effort to avoid what he terms a certain \\"hyperbolic syndrome\\" that is usually associated with any critical discussion of George Washington. In his introduction, Ellis rhetorically asks how we can \\"accurately map the terrain\\" of Washington's life \\"without imposing the impossible expectations.\\" Ellis appropriately warns that when examining Washington, \\"if we find ourselves being merely celebratory, or its judgmental twin, dismissive, we should rub our eyes and look again.\\"Ellis thereby begins with the premise that, as a biographer, anyone ought to begin their quest \\"looking for a man rather than a statute, and any statutes that are encountered should be quickly knocked off their pedestals.\\" Ellis effectively wipes the Washington-slate clean; he begins tabla rasa and ultimately does a great job at painting a portrait of Washington that, not-coincidentally, is akin to other statutesque conclusions previosuly concluded by others.My one complaint with the book involves the author's style. Often times, Ellis will draw conclusions about Washington's character and/or ideology which are based on statements to the effect of \\"... all of the evidence points to thus.\\" In coming across these repeated affirmations, I found myself wanting to know the details; wanting for Ellis to specifically delineate the evidence. Overall though, the author does a great job of inserting Washington's own words and the words of his peers and the book is adequately footnoted.On a positive note, Ellis, as with every good biography, deviates from the comfortable, all-too-common, historical-narrative-chronology (i.e., 'X' happened, then 'Y' happened, and after that 'Z' happened). Instead, at appropriate times, Ellis grasps certain themes throughout the book and interesting weaves them into the narrative coming back to them repeatedly.For example (and probably most importantly), one prominent topic throughout the book involved Washington's philosophy regarding slavery. At certain points in the book, Ellis illuminates Washington's then-current view on the topic, or more appropriately Washington's wrestle with and evolving view on the institution. Though anyone with a rudimentary knowledge of Washington knows that he ulitmately emancipated his slaves upon Martha's death via his will, Ellis does an outstanding job in ellucidating the nuances of Washington's ever-evolving philosophy.\\"His Excellency\\" is a great starting point for any study of the life of George Washington. Again Joseph Ellis has demonstrated his ability to bring a larger-than-life historical figures to a wide audience. I would highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"George Washington's legacy is captured by the very word \\"United States\\", because as Joseph Ellis notes in his tremendously perceptive biography, it was Washington's consuming vision, from his time as leader of the Continental Army to his Presidency, that the first word \\"United\\" trump the second \\"States\\". This was no minor achievement. The forces conspiring against the union were many and powerful. During the war for independence, Washington had to contend with the British empire at the height of its powers, as well as an American spirit at the height of its revolutionary individualism. The Continental Congress was as weak and inept as the British empire strong and imperious, and as such, Washington the Commander was faced with a Sisyphean task. To defeat the British, the states were forced to consolidate power, but that very consolidation threatened the spirit of liberty and individualism that birthed the revolution. Making this apparently untenable balance tenable is the defining mark of Washington's legacy, for it followed him into the Presidency, where he had to endure accusations of monarchial ambitions while pursuing a course that led the incipient nation into federalism.Most importantly, as Ellis notes, no one but Washington could have achieved all of this. And he achieved it precisely because he passionately believed in it. For Washington, American independence and nationhood were synonymous. Independence without unity meant nothing, and so he committed to pursuing a political course that recognized that \\"what was politically essential for a viable American nation was ideologically at odds with what it claimed to stand for.\\" In other words, the war for independence produced a people deeply distrustful of government, but one absolutely dependent on its centering stimulus. The colonists were fighting for independence from Britain, but any ambition beyond that was subject to debate. Washington was willing to countenance that debate, but he was determined to win it.While the facts of Washington's Presidency are well and often recounted, what sets Ellis' biography apart are his poignant observations, not only political but also personal. The Washington that emerges here is one of immense pride. His disastrous campaign against New York and other early failures in the war could have been averted had he listened to his young General Nathanial Greene, who favored guerilla tactics. Washington thought the Fabian mode of war beneath a man of his dignity, and only later, when he realized he could not win a conventional war, did Washington swallow his considerable pride and resort to attack and run tactics.Washington was also relatively unschooled. He had the modern equivalent of a grade school education and came into his wealth largely from marriage. By contrast, other founding fathers were famously well-educated and patrician, and for the rest of his life, Washington bore the seeds of resentment. Indeed, it is difficult to tell how much of his anger toward Britain stemmed from this inferiority complex, but it is obvious he passionately resented British airs, even as Washington himself (certainly more than the other founding fathers) approached an imperial bearing.One of the most timely lessons to be gained from studying Washington is his approach to both human nature and foreign policy. He stated: \\"It is a maxim founded on the universal experience of mankind, that no nation is to be trusted farther than it is bound by its interest; and no prudent statesman or politician will venture to depart from it.\\" Nations, he claimed, were driven by interests, and not ideals. Obviously, how and where the two intersect is a sometimes messy affair, but at the very least, our current President's idea of nation and democracy building abroad violates this principle. Our ideals may demand a democratically elected Iraqi government, but our interests may not. As is often noted, it is in our nation's best interests that the ideal of democracy is violated in Middle Eastern countries where relatively moderate regimes would be far more radical if replaced by the will of the people.Realism was a defining characteristic of Washington; indeed, Ellis claims that his genius was his judgment, and that keen judgment extended to his view of mankind. Jefferson and many leaders of the revolution so distrusted government that had they assumed the Presidency, this nation would surely have failed from weakness and political anarchy. Yet, Washington noted \\"mankind left to themselves are unfit for their own government\\" and therefore advocated a more powerful role for the central government. It took all of his considerable popularity and all of the Providence in the universe to forge a viable government out of the chaotic mess that was the colonies. But in the end, the United States became the United States, and for that, we and the rest of the world may be eternally grateful."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"I have read several biographies of Washington and this one is by far the best and in many ways the most informative. Ellis brings Washington to life as no other author has. We see him opposed to slavery for very practical reasons -- slaves eat, age, and become liabilities. Washington was a hardheaded business man and slavery was simply not economically practical. Not a very noble conclusion but certainly realistic and a view of Washington not commonly presented. Then we have the young man seeking a military career and being offended by his treatment by the British. Another realistic reaction and one that later colors his attiude towards Britain during his Presidency. We witness his youth and evolution from British subject to revolutionary. I was surprised he had a Plan B in case he actually lost the war because he fully expected to be hanged if the British ever got their hands on him. This book truly presents Washington as a human being with all of his strengths and weaknesses. We see him in his second term harried by those about him and we truly understand why he chose not to seek a third term -- thus inadvertently setting a precedent among the many precedents he set. By the time you get to the end of this book you truly realize what enormous influence Washington had on our country, that he was a brilliant general, and that he absolutely deserves to have his face on our money and that he was a great president. This is easily the best book on Washington that I have read and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"There have been few attempts at writing a biography of George Washington but Ellis nails it perfectly. This book stays on topic and tells us the essentials of the Presidents life. The dilemma of setting up a government and George Washington's style of leadership is shown well throughout the whole biography. It is a very quick read and was very well written like many of Ellis books are. This is one of my favorites by him and a valuable addition to the revolutionary literature. For those who are just starting out in the American Revolution this is a great place to start. For those who are long time students this is a worthwhile addition to any library."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"It has always been a challenge for me when speculating on who was the greater between George Washington and Abraham Lincoln. Both played key roles in either founding or preserving the nation. Both stood above illustrious peers as they transformed vision into reality and carved out their respective places in history. Both still command respect throughout the world as icons of freedom. Yet, after reading Joseph Ellis' present biography, I feel myself leaning towards George Washington. Washington may be the \\"deadest, whitest male in American history,\\" but he stood in a gap that only he could fill.Ellis begins with a gallant and ambitious 21-year-old Washington sent to the frontier as an emissary on a dangerous mission and ends with an outpouring of accolades such as from Henry \\"Light Horse Harry\\" Lee, who said of Washington, \\"He was first in war, first in peace, and first in the hearts of his countrymen.\\" In between, Ellis makes a strong case for Washington as the one indispensable figure in the American cause. His record on the battlefield may have been checkered, but his soldiers remained loyal because they sensed that God was protecting him. History attests that Washington was shot at many times, his hats and his coats bear this out, but he was never wounded.Within the scope of a compact biography, Ellis delivers a balanced treatment. Washington was not a one-man show. He depended on able and trusted subordinate commanders. They included Horatio Gates, Nathanael Greene, Henry Knox, and, of course, Benedict Arnold. Some historical writers give arch-traitor Arnold short shrift, but that is not good history. Arnold played a key role in the pivotal Battle of Saratoga and helped win the war before turning coat.Victory at Saratoga gained the Continentals credibility and, ultimately, the French as allies. With France on the American side, Britain's naval supremacy eventually was broken. For it was between the Continental army and the French navy that Cornwallis found his army trapped at Yorktown, forcing him to surrender in the last major battle of the war. With deft strokes Ellis touches on all of this, as well as on Washington's postwar life as country gentleman and Chief Executive, and how he once again transformed \\"the improbable into the inevitable.\\"\\"His Excellency\\" is a fine history of the man known as the \\"Father of his Country.\\" It shows a flesh and blood Washington, shod with feet of clay like the rest of us. For he too was flawed, he could be land hungry and a social climber, but at the same time, he was a hero for the ages. As John Adams described him, \\"Now we can allow a certain Citizen to be wise, virtuous, and good, without thinking him a Deity or a saviour.\\" Rev. Dennis J. Mercieri"},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"You can't understand your country unless you understand it's past. Despite reading a 3 volume biography on George Washington many years ago, it was not until I read this book that understood the magnitude of his contribution to the very existance of the United States. Was GW a perfect general, far from it. Was GW a perfect person, not quite. Was he the one of the people who held fast to a believe in freedom, democracy and the right to self directed happiness and made it possible for all of us to enjoy the same, absolutly. If you want to understand your country and the real person that was George Washington including the good, bad and some ugly: read this book."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"This is an entertaining and enjoyable book, but the psychoanalysis of George Washington left something to be desired. At several places, the author relies on tidbits of information to making sweeping generalizations regarding Washington, why he succeeded, or his motivations. This would not have so severely affected my rating, but for the fact that on more than one occasion, the author quickly reversed course.For example, when trying to explain why, near the beginning of the Revolution, George Washington was better situated than any of his peers to lead the Americans to victory, Joseph Ellis tells us that George Washington was a realist who fully recognized that Divine Providence did not guarantee victory. Only a few pages later, commenting on George Washington's forbearance in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds, Joseph Ellis tells us that the George Washington's internally sustaining force was his belief in, yep, Divine Providence.It may be a quibble, but this example early in the book, left me doubtful of Mr. Ellis's explanations for other aspects of George Washington's character and the underlying rationale for some of his actions. At times, Mr. Ellis may have pressed too hard to generalize from single letters or comments. Perhaps Washington was uniquely realistic in assessing the chances for success and also believed in Divine Providence, but Mr. Ellis did a poor job of acknolwedging both these aspects and, presumably, the tension even within Washington.I also thought Ellis went a bit far with his \\"Fabian\\" and \\"Cinncinatus\\" analogies. The repetition towards the end of the book became irksome and, again, seemed Ellis was trying too hard to fit evidence into preconceived categories.The book was quite informative and engaging. It is clear that Joseph Ellis reveres the man, but this usually did not cause him to shy from recounting Washington's failings, including those of character. Importantly, I think Ellis does a good job of providing enough factual context to let the reader make some judgments. Some other reviewers appear to claim this is a hatchet job, but my view is that it is anything but. Unflattering facts are revealed, but Ellis was, in my view, more quick to explain them away than he needed to be. George Washington was a man, not a god. Ellis's portrait captures that distinction without denigrating Washington or his considerable influence on the making of the United States of America.In short, Ellis paints a convincing portrait of an ambitious man with a tremendous ability both to lead men and to persevere in the face of adversity. Washington does seem to have had enormous concern regarding his legacy, but this is not a bad thing. As an example, if Mr. Ellis's portrayal is accurate, George Washington's concern for legacy was a driving factor in his decision to free his slaves in his will. Likewise, while Mr. Ellis seems to indicate that George Washington tried to burnish his reputation for high character by revising certain details of his early life, his desire to be revered also led him to act in conformance with the image he strove to create. In other words, while Washington did not always act with honor while young, his growing concern for legacy provided additional pressure, if not motivation, for his rightly renowned decision to relinquish power and, too, smaller acts of honor. Washington, to some degree, became the man he wished to be perceived to be. Joseph Ellis did not paint a flat caricature of the man, but provided a three-dimensional, if sometimes flawed, portrait of one of the most important men in the history of the United States.I recommend this book."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"It was very evident to me while reading this book that Ellis had done his homework as a Washington biographer. Apparently, Ellis has studied nearly all of Washington's available writings, and his broad knowledge is obvious in this work.While I did appreciate the impartial facts he presents, I do feel Ellis' conclusions regarding Washington's motives for many of his decisions and actions throughout his life are skewed considerably.For instance, for the first approximately 50 pages of this book, Ellis suggests that nearly every decision Washington made was based on some selfish desire to further his economic standing among his fellow comparatively wealthy Virginia plantation owners. Everything Washington does, Ellis claims, from him serving as a leader of several Virginia militia men in the French and Indian War to his marriage to Martha, a wealthy widow, was based on an overwhelming greed and lust for recognition and wealth. Based on my prior readings and study of Washington, I believe this is certainly not the case.Of course, each of us as individuals and parents wants to secure for ourselves and families a prosperous livelihood, but Ellis seldom if ever suggests that Washington's motives are altruistic. Instead, Ellis paints the portrait of a pouting, bitter, violent, selfish, and greedy Washington when he doesn't receive the recognition or monies he feels he is due for his service in the military or as an affluent landowner. For instance, after Horatio Gates, one of Washington's generals, scores a major victory for the American cause during the Battle of Saratoga by defeating and capturing all of British General John Burgoyne's forces, Ellis suggests that Washington felt little more than bitter jealousy and resentment that he wasn't present during the decisive victory. Rarely does Ellis give Washington any credit for having any pure and noble motives.Ellis also makes it a point to spotlight how severe and even abusive he believes Washington was to the men who served under his command. Ellis would have us believe that Washington's men lived in mortal fear of their commander, as he states that Washington's men were frequently beaten and occasionally executed when Washington's stern standards weren't met. Though elements of Ellis' accusations may be proven fact, it seemed to me that Ellis tended to linger over and highlight the exceedingly infrequent dark and questionable aspects of Washington's life, when certainly there are far more praiseworthy and noble characteristics to discuss regarding this great man.Ellis even breaches the issue that it can't be proven that Washington didn't have sexual relations with a close friend's wife, Sally Fairfax, when there was no overwhelming evidence that their relationship even approached adulterous. Ellis' shallow reasoning for suggesting this inappropriate relationship is based on a letter Washington wrote to Sally, expressing that the times he spent with her were the happiest in his life. What Ellis failed to divulge is that Washington wrote this letter with the full knowledge and support of his wife, and that the letter was meant to convey that the associations he and Martha shared with Sally and her husband as married couples were treasured moments. (If you don't believe this, do some research of your own.)Toward the middle and end of 'His Excellency,' Ellis repeatedly, even redudantly, states that Washington was obsessed with what the history books might later record of him, to the point that it controlled his every political and moral decision. In other words, whenever Ellis offers his personal opinion regarding Washington's motives, Ellis always suggests that Washington considered his own vain ambitions and the selfish regard for history's approval first, before he ever looked for the right and wrong implications involved in a decision.The misconstrued and subjective opinions that Ellis has woven throughout his work have left a very sour taste in my mouth indeed. Washington's strength and steadiness in the face of enormous opposition deserves a much more favorable account, instead of the severe negativity attributed to him in Ellis' biography. If you would like to read a much truer and factual and well-written account, read the 900-plus page \\"The Real George Washington\\" by Jay Parry.One last thing I'll say is that I found Ellis' writing style to be very difficult to plod through. There are times when his writing is brilliant and flows with some very beautiful prose, but those moments are far too infrequent to warrant a recommendation from me. For the most part, his writing doesn't flow well at all and isn't nearly as cohesive as other biographies I've read.In short, I definitely DO NOT recommend this work to anyone."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"This book seemed like it was written by two authors. One, who wrote the portion that covers events up to the end of the Battle of Yorktown takes great pains to demonize Washington. The character presented is a power hungry, egotistical, condescending, inept, deceitful, first class jackass. The author fails to even discuss how such an odious character came to be held in such high esteem by his contemporaries that he was unanimously appointed head of the Continental Army before there even was a Continental Army.The second half of the book, starting with the end of the Revolutionary War, takes a completely different approach and praises Washington to no end. This later characterization makes him out to be the second messiah. On multiple occasions, the author compares Washington to Julius Caesar, Oliver Cromwell, Napoleon, Lenin, and Chairman Mao - all of who come up short in comparison to Washington. The one area that seems to trouble the author and hence the reader was Washington retaining his slaves for the duration of his lifetime. The author seemed unable to conceive of the values of an Nineteenth Century Virginia Gentlemen and couldn't come to grips with the discordance of so obvious a character flaw in so great a character."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"A methodical and well-crafted biography of Washington, portraying him neither as demigod nor demogogue, but as a strong, heroic man with occasional feet of clay, someone who well deserves to be considered the Hero of the Revolutionary War and the Father of His Country, but who was also possessed of both a temper and an aggrieved sense of sleights from others, as well as a fear of ridicule and poor reputation that drove him as much as any noble commitment to revolution and principle. Headstrong in battle, Washington was still the best and most effective military leader of the Revolution, and his careful style and insistence on stepping aside when the time was right (versus become the military dictator that some feared and many expected) entitle him to much of the admiration that subsequent generations have given him. An excellent review of the Revolutionary period and the First Presidency.This unabridged 13 CDs (vs. 352pp) audiobook proceeds at a decent pace, and Runger's narration is clear and even, almost, but never quite, to the point of being soporific."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"I think that Joe Ellis acquitted himself quite well insofar as his stated goal. He wasn't attempting a comprehensive treatment of Washington but was trying to breathe some life into the marble bust that is our dollar bill occupant.I find the Founders much more interesting for their humanity when it can be found and find the American experiment much more remarkable with an understanding of the vanity, ambition, rivalries, and mistakes of the men and women who gave birth to the experiment itself.A desire to keep Washington frozen in his heroic bust belies a weak definition of heroism. Those we most admire are human and are often the focus of our attention largely because their ambitions drove them beyond their contemporaries. Most biographers probably reach beyond where they should to explain their subjects but I don't think Ellis has done much of that here. I appreciate his portrait and I sensed he too was admiring of Washington, not attempting to denigrate him.If there is one thing that this book didn't answer for me (and will cause me to read more Washington bios) is just what it was about His Excellency that engendered such fervent loyalty and admiration among his contemporaries. He clearly was unrivaled in the love and accolades from those around him."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"He was a king in everything but name. George Washington was that rare mortal whose apotheosis started long before his death. Beginning with his unlikely triumph over the British during the long and brutal revolutionary war, Washington exerted a hold on the national psyche unmatched by most kings, and by no subsequent presidents. In the proud annals of US History, he lives in a place of honor separate from all others.From this premise does Joseph Ellis seek to deconstruct, but not to denigrate, the Washington mystique. The title the author chooses, like the rest of the devices employed in this careful, studious biography, is deliberate. Washington's place in society, as a general, a president, the pinnacle of the Virginia landed elite, demanded a moniker that hinted at the superhuman. But his famous refusal of royal station left a vacuum of nomenclature, a natural metaphor for the political void left in the wake of the British troops vacating the fledgling state. Washington's title, like the rest of the nascent political culture, derived from ad hoc experiment. Some called him Majesty, some Honorable, some Excellency; but all called him great.Ellis personal affection for \\"the foundingest father of all\\" often shows through his restrained and scholarly style. He can scarcely conceal his excitement when he informs us in the preface of his opportunity to access the modern edition of the \\"Washington Papers\\", \\"all the scattered pieces of paper in the attic...gathered together, catalogued and classified\\". Only a historian of Ellis' passion can evoke the thrill of plumbing a subject which has, obviously, lived large in his imagination since boyhood.But Ellis, to his credit, never gets carried away, and has delivered a remarkable work devoid of any hint of hagiography. He weaves together themes with a careful integration of fact and analysis as he guides us through Washington's formative years, the compelling story of his engagement in the French and Indian War, and on through his better known trials as Commander in Chief and President of a new nation. The story, of course, works on its own merits, but Ellis gives it flesh, offering up credible conjecture about how Washington's psychology and temperment moved the world.And though he doesn't make the mistake of deifying Washington, he does spend a lot of time praising with faint damnation. From Ellis we get a sketch of a man almost too determined for his own good, stubborn to a fault, and laconic due to a lack of natural intellecutalism. But each one of these \\"faults\\" can, and is, in Ellis' rendering, transmuted to a strength. He may have been lucky from time to time, Ellis seems to say, but he was meant to be lucky. Some people are fated for real greatness--despite Washington's occasional best efforts to the contrary, he was one of them."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"When studying American History in a required college course we discussed the Founding Fathers and the talk turned to why people found Franklin and Jefferson and even Adams so appealing and thought Washington was so \\"blah\\" - as the preface to Ellis' book quotes - \\"the deadest whitest male\\". Some talked about why he was the first President since Jefferson was more intelligent, etc. Our teacher let the conversation go on and then asked a question - if Jefferson was smarter and Franklin was quicker and Adams a better diplomat why did so many of them turn to Washington and say \\"you go first\\"? Why did THEY look up to HIM? I've always remembered that question and was pleased to see it restated in Eliis' introduction because, for me, it cast Washington in a completely different light then AND since. He's not the man on the dollar bill or the quarter or in the stoney-faced portraits. He IS the man who was out surveying land in his teens,who led troops into several disastrous battles early in his life,who married one of the most prominent widows in the Commonwealth of Virginia,who managed the complex and beautiful estate of Mt. Vernon,who put together the coalition of troops in the Revolution,who stood up against the government from whom his ancestors had profited,who played politics with the best of them,who started some of the best traditions and standards of the country, among them the legacy that the country's military must have a civilian commander.These are all pieces of George. Not Mr. President, not \\"his excellency\\", not \\"General\\", but George, the man, and Ellis tells about the man very well indeed."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"As an avid student of American history, I've always found George Washington to be the most inaccessible of our nation's historical figures. To me he is presented more as an icon than a person, having been elevated by generations of acclaim to the point where he is out of reach from mere mortals. Joseph Ellis's book is an attempt to bring him back down to earth. Like his previous studies of John Adams and Thomas Jefferson, this is not so much a biography (of which Ellis notes there are plenty, most of which have only added to the adulation) as a character study of Washington that seeks to humanize this distant figure.The man who comes across is driven by considerable ambition, deeply sensitive about his social status and determined to project the persona of a Virginia aristocrat. His commitment to the Revolutionary cause, Ellis demonstrates, was a product of his experiences. His growing resentment of British rule was fueled by their efforts to restrict westward expansion, while his subsequent support for a stronger central government was a result of his years as the commanding general of the perpetually under-funded Continental Army; it was, Ellis notes, not central government that Washington objected to, but a central government controlled by the British.These two elements combined later in life to bring Washington out of retirement to spearhead the push for a stronger national government. The general feared that his achievements during the Revolution were jeopardized by the weakness of the Confederation government, and he eventually agreed to participate in the Constitutional Convention in the summer of 1787 to create a stronger, more durable governing system. His service as president was essential to securing the new Constitution's acceptance, during which he found himself increasingly siding with the Federalists and their vision of a strong central government - a stand that brought Washington under increasing attack from Jefferson and his supporters during his final term in office.Well-written and perceptive, Ellis's book does an outstanding job of making Washington accessible. He analyzes the key points in Washington's life with insight, explaining why he made the decisions that did so much to shape events. By focusing on Washington's character, he is able to discern motivations and traits that are often lost amid the details in the multivolume tomes written about him by other authors. For anyone seeking to understand the personality of \\"the father of our country\\" and how it shaped our history, this is the book to read."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"Joseph Ellis' \\"Founding Brothers: The Revolutionary Generation\\" was awarded a Pulitzer Prize in 2001. I was so impressed by that volume that I immediately read - and also admired - his biographies of Thomas Jefferson (American Sphinx) and John Adams (Passionate Sage).Ellis knows this period COLD - as well as any historian putting pen to paper (or finger to keyboard) today. But he also knows the warm flesh and blood of the Revolutionary Generation as well.Reading \\"His Excellency\\" compared to other published biographies of George Washington is like standing next to the Man himself compared to standing next to a statue of the man - or even more distant, next to the Washington Monument or the \\"heads\\" side of a quarter.All biographers of Washington have begun with forewords that talk about the iconic Washington of the dollar bill and other cold and impersonal images - and how they want to write so that you can know the human side. Mr. Ellis succeeds in this task in a way that makes Washington live and breathe.He makes it clear that although Benjamin Franklin was wiser, John Adams better read, Alexander Hamilton more brilliant and Thomas Jefferson more intellectual - they ALL considered George Washington the pre-eminent figure of the Revolutionary Generation. When it came time for the constitutional convention Franklin privately told Washington that no one else could lead such an enterprise and that the final result would be inferior without his input. When that constitutional convention mandated that a President be elected as Chief Executive of the Nation - no other candidate was even seriously considered.Ellis allows us to see the man and the humanity and the excellence of character that made some of the greatest men in our history clamor to Washington for leadership. Over and over again Washington set aside his personal life and opportunity for personal gain to instead answer the call to the service of his country - and Washington could claim the United States as *His* country more than any American before or since.The clearest biography of the Leader of the Founding Fathers yet. Not the longest, not the most comprehensive, but Ellis has chipped away the chaffe to leave a polished gem that shines on every page. Perhaps there's ANOTHER Prize awaiting Mr. Ellis."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"Ellis' George Washington is a rich narrative of a largely unknowable man. Washington is a 21st century biographers nightmare because he was not as irascible as John Adams nor did he have the flirtatious dalliances of a Thomas Jefferson or a Benjamin Franklin. Washington instead appears like a statute whom historians and psychohistorians cannot even begin to clear away the patina to get a good glimpse of the inner man. Ellis attempts this and concludes that while Jefferson theorized, Washington just mainly survived. In this he is anomaly because the critical period of American history can not be imagined without him, yet progressives and revisionists have ignored him. While Adams and Jefferson wrote more about republican and democratic theory, Washington never allowed anything close to the passage of the Alien and Sedition Act nor the Embargo Act. An oversimplification of this interplay is that while most of the founders talked, Washington acted and essentially achieved the results that he wanted. In what is probably the highlight of the book, Ellis presents Washington heading off the Newburg Conspiracy which was formed by disgruntled officers designed to hijack the burgeoning republic in it's cradle. After placating his soldiers Washington never wavers from his bedrock principle of Republicanism tempered with a harsh realism. Overall Ellis' Washington is a man who acted upon what he believed and saved the infant republic several times over. Probably his greatest sin, in the eyes of the professional historian, was that he never much talked about what he did, but I think he can be forgiven for that rather unfortunate oversight."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"What an excellent bio of our first Prez. Although it is very difficult to get at the heart of what Washington was thinking and feeling, since his most personal correspondence was completely destroyed, Ellis brings his impressive abilities from \\"Founding Brothers\\" to bear and the result is a very good read. If you've read recent bios of Franklin, Adams, and Hamilton over the past couple years or so, you will get a different perspective that will inform and entertain.One complaint is that this book is just too short. I realize that Ellis was probably trying to keep it under 300pp so that it could appeal to a wider appeal than Chernow's Hamilton bio or McCullough's Adams bio does, I found myself wanting more, not just at the end, but all the way through. That's the ONLY reason I give it 4 starts instead of 5.Fabulous read, though."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"Somehow, Joseph Ellis can take a man's life and within less than 300 pages break down his subject's personality into manageable slices exposing the reader to his inner workings. Ellis takes the most important elements of Washington's experiences and ties them to the manifested traits that made Washington a calming force in a turbulent transition. Exposing Washington's boiling undercurrent with the explanation of how it was a constant battle for him to appear stoic without showing the perspiration. The building blocks of his battles with General Braddock, the losses in New York during the revolution, and later when Jefferson pushed him to his limits, are placed into the soup of Washington's psyche. Ellis then pulls out the salient points and molds the pieces into wonderfully told story of the Father of our Country.Washington was not without ego, but one needs to pry underneath the floor to see it. The composed exterior was actual hard work for Washington. Washington was not without his faults or his kryptonite. Slavery was something that he took nearly an entire lifetime to settle. Ellis is magnificent in his presentation of this monster of an issue. However, he also does not attempt to put his explanation in a twenty-first though process. Ellis is realistic in his analysis of Washington's dilemma; and he attempts to show all of issues as they stared Washington directly in the face each day. It wasn't until his final will and testament that we learn some of the equation.Washington was always looking for how history would see him. His life was sliced into several phases, each always adding to the myth and the legend. There might not have been another man on the planet that could have kept his ego in check with the accomplishments that he attained. Without a storied education (such as Adams and Jefferson had attained), he allowed his moral compass to show him the way to his eternal pedestal. Ellis is amazing in how much he can put on the few pages that are used. It isn't as difficult to write a 1000 page book as it is to find the correct way to sum up a great historic figure in a mere 275 pages. The research is again faultless. Ellis is mostly a primary source historian.I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"I read this book as my first choice in an ambitious project to read a biography of every US president in chronological order through Reagan.After about the first 20 pages, I feared that my first foray into this project would be a dissapointment. The writing seemed awkward, and the author seemed a little overly harsh on his subject. It seemed at that time that his title choice of \\"His Excellency\\" was simply a sarcastic swipe at the ego of a man he seemed to despise.But, it was all just a more than appropriate set-up for the demonstration of how Washington grew into the great man he became. Through this method, Ellis immediately strikes down any remaining notions of the myth of George Washington--a myth that, for many of us, was hammered into our heads as kids as we learned of a man who could not tell a lie.What we get in return is a richer, fairer, portrait of one of our most important founding leaders. And, I came away with an ever greater appreciation for Washington's greatness and genius. I finished the book with a feeling that I knew the man and not the myth, the flesh and bone and not the marble of the statue.And, lastly, the work demonstrated very well how different Washington's persona was from the other influential politicians and thinkers of the time. He was not among the more educated of the founders, indeed not even among the more brilliant. But, he was an unstoppable force, a larger-than-life persona and legend in his own time.I give it four stars, not five, only because it was a little too sparse. 100 pages more would have kept it concise, but provided that little extra context that it needs."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"I had a problem with the tone of this book from the start. Ellis makes definitive, conclusory statements consistently. This would be great if substantiated, except his assertions are frequently without clear citation. After a few paragraphs you're lead to an endnote that cites dozens of pages of another book or lumps two or three of Washington's letters together. This is especially concerning regarding Ellis's treatment of slavery (which incidentally seems to get more time than any other topic, and was the most rewarding portion to read). With such a charged topic I would think perfect citing is a must.The other aspect of the book that is troubling of the repetition of themes - almost as if Ellis is anticipating chapters are going to be read separately or photocopies and handed out to a class. He reasserts the same point (Cinncinattus and Fabian thinking) in an odd way, especially considering the short length of the book and the cursory nature he treats topics worth more time.Because Washington is worth reading about, this book is worth reading. But I'll be looking for a more complete biography that I can put a little more faith in regarding the sources. I'd recommend \\"His Excellency\\" for someone who is looking for a new perspective on Washington, not someone looking to read their first biography on our first president. As for Ellis's attempt to read Washington's mind - from marrying Martha to freeing his slaves in his will - the reader has to take the authors word for it. There aren't enough hard facts cited to make a convincing case for many of Ellis's conclusions."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"The image of George Washington the idol, the statesman, the restrained aristocrat, and the ideal president has always permeated society to some extent. While Joseph J. Ellis feels some of his reputation survives because of Washington's actual character, he also believes much of the legacy surrounding the man is mere legend. While any historical study should certainly look to the past with a skeptical and objective eye, Ellis attempts to deconstruct so much of Washington's reputation that it often feels like he's skimming over many of the important aspects of Washington that made him truly great. As a result, \\"His Excellency\\" doesn't read like an objective biography, but rather like a skeptical revisionist's history of a man who is widely respected and revered. This is not to say it's a worthless read or an unscholarly diatribe; Ellis' work is a thorough, intriguing study of Washington, it's just not a holistic, timeless biographical portrait.Ellis immediately skips past the majority of Washington's childhood, jumping directly to the French and Indian War as a starting point. This in itself feels rushed and, while Ellis does effectively illustrate Washington's transition from immature twenty-somethingness to restrained manhood, he fails to illustrate any notable backdrop of childhood and adolescence. From the French and Indian War up until the end of the Revolutionary War Ellis' portrait of Washington focuses mostly on his motivations in private life, which Ellis views as being based in self-interest and desire for land and economic wealth. These were most definitely motivations of Washington, but Ellis spends so much time on these that all of the other considerations seem either ignored or deemed false. The second half of the book, focusing on Washington's post-war achievements, discusses \\"the man\\" of Washington through the same lens of self-interest. This time, however, Ellis talks with relation to the public, political realm. While it is interesting to examine Washington's self-interested motivations in either light, once again, Ellis' depiction feels rushed and narrow.Right from the beginning it seemed obvious that Ellis was painting a much more skeptically speculative than objective interpretation of Washington as a man, but it seems as though Ellis himself believes this book is a happy medium between revisionism and idolatry. I trust that Ellis' intention in writing the work was to be highly objective and void of any revisionist tones, but in the extent Ellis speculates extensively on obscure quotes and instances while breezing over the traditional milestones we all know, one senses that Ellis is exaggerating minute, whether true or not, aspects of Washington while ignoring the other vital events, motivations, spiritual leanings, and characteristics that made up the man.On a more positive note, Ellis' research and speculation is fascinating and often convincing, his writing style is also fluid and highly readable; this somewhat made up for the lack of a complete angle at Washington, and provided for an enjoyable reading experience despite my disappointments in the area of \\"focus\\". Many Washington fanatics may actually appreciate the work for the exact same reasons I didn't. This is the first biography I've read solely discussing the character of Washington in any significant depth, and after Ellis' reassurance in the preface that this was not an attempt at revision or extensive speculation I was eager to pursue the study. This was simply not what I took to be the reality of his writing.If they had a 3 1/2 star rating, that is what I would've given this book. I must simply say that if one has the time and desire to read only one biography of Washington, this may not be the best choice. It is interesting and worthwhile in an out of the ordinary, academic-pursuit way, but I felt it was no where near a holistic view of Washington's character. For the history reader that only wishes to read one book on Washington I would look elsewhere; for the Washington buff that wants a specific, unconventional speculation of the man, Ellis' work may turn out to be quite appealing."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"I found this book by Ellis to be a beautifully written and incredibly compelling read. I found myself sitting in my car for hours listening to the Audio book in my driveway at home just so that I could hear the next word.

Ellis is able to tap into the mind of Washington and depict to the reader what Washington was and may have been thinking at different stages in his life, from a General to the President, to the Mount Vernon farmer that Washington longed to be. Ellis is able to do all of this beautifully and sufficiently in less than three hundred pages. For those merely wanting to read a good biography on interesting and crucial events in America's history, this is an excellent book.

I'm always interested in learning when those first seeds of revolution begin to germinate in the mind of each of the founding fathers, and this book does not disappoint."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"This is a beautifully written book that brings the to life the personality (thin skinned, proper, formal etc.) of George Washington as well as the thought that went into the key decisions in his life - Deciding on independence, the stubborn fight for New York in 1776, the decision to fight Cornwallis and risk losing the continental army rather than take a winter break as was customary in that time, etc.). I also found facinating to read about the world's super power of that era (Britain), the mistakes they made, and the thought process that led them to those mistakes. -- It sounds very much like modern history.Some of the criticism I read in other reviews is that the book is short and does not go deep enough. I disagree with those assessments for two reasons.First, this book is really meant to compliment other more in-depth books on Washington - such as Flexner's masterful biography. It succinctly puts you in the context of the times, and shows you how the personality of Washington shaped (and to some extent mirrored) the personality of the Nation.Second, there are several long books on Washington. The modest size of this book makes it more approachable to more people. It's a quick read because it is under 300 pages, and because Ellis writes so well.When I look at how much coverage High School text books give to George Washington - (my daughter's history book devoted two paragraphs - and spent most of that time telling the students that George didn't really cut down the cherry trees)-- I think this book is a great way to expose the younger generation to the Founding Father that our textbooks like to ignore. BRAVO Mr. Ellis."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"What many readers will like about this biography, I found frustrating. The book provides a nice summary of all of the key facets and phases of Washington's life. Because it makes no attempt to be exhaustive, it should not be exhausting to any reader. However, it would have been nice at times to read more about both Washington's relationships and thought processes. For example, how Washington came to know many of the key participants in the Revolutionary Era -- Jefferson, Madison, Hamilton, Franklin -- is scarcely discussed. They simply appear on the scene. Washington's decision to involve himself on the side of the Patriots is discussed, but hardly in detail.Perhaps that is an unfair criticism, since Ellis did not set out to write the kind of biography that I would have preferred. More positively, the book does a fine job of separating Washington the man from the myth, and the discussion of Washington's struggle to come to grips with the issue of slavery is excellent. Early in his life, the acceptability of slavery was a given in Washington's world. However, by the time of the Revolution, he was increasingly exposed to other viewpoints. Unlike many southern slaveholders, Washington refused to divide slave families by selling family members, and this resulted in a slave population at Mount Vernon that far exceeded its labor needs. While Washington did not reach conclusions on the issue as quickly as we would have liked, he alone of the politically prominent Virginia planters made forceful declarations in his will freeing all of the slaves under his control.The book also repudiates some of the mythology that has surrounded Washington. He was neither a harvester of cherry trees nor a person who threw his silver coins away. He was neither promiscuous nor particularly religious. His marriage to Martha was largely for pragmatic reasons -- she was wealthy -- but they also appeared to have an affectionate relationship.I would recommend this book as a fine overview of the life of Washington."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"Your enjoyment of Mr. Ellis' book, \\"His Excellency\\" will be based upon your goals in reading the book. He states from the outset that this is not a comprehensive history of George Washington, but rather an attempt to provide an accessible history of Washington's life.Positives:I learned about the ideas and formative experiences that shaped George Washington's life, and how his outlook influenced his decisions throughout his life as General, President, and aging hero.*How poverty impacted his view of wealth*The internal and external debate over slavery in the early Republic*The struggles of the Continental Army during wartime*Washington's handling of the presidency*Washington's retirement to Mt. Vernon*Washington's poor judgement in getting involved with another potential military campaign at the end of his life.I also enjoy Mr. Ellis' concise, informative writing style.Negatives: None. I am now more interesting in learning about Mr. Washington in a more exhaustive biography. This book left me satisfied, but not moved in the way that Founding Brothers did. Althought for some, this is not a satisfactory explanation for this text losing a star-so be it."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"Ellis helps make a historical novel an intriguing story instead of a dreary lesson. I was delighted by the details he was able to assume and piece together about our first president. His Excellency is a charismatic, yet enigmatic figure worth exploring."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"I was able to view an exhibit of Washington's papers on exhibit at New York's J.P. Morgan Library a few years ago. Apparently Joseph Ellis uses his reading of \\"The Papers of George Washington\\" as the basic research material for this excellent, all be it short, biography of Washington. Ellis attempts to get into his subjects inter life through well-argued speculation. He points out that Washington, unlike our modern Presidents, did not self justify by invoking the name of God, but saw things as \\"destiny\\" and \\"providence\\". Washington died; Ellis maintains \\"a Roman Secular rather than a Christian Saint\\". The book is fast paced and Ellis covers a lot of ground in few words. He gives the reader an overall topic or offers an interesting question and then drills down to offer up the sole of the topic and then moves on. The reader picks up lots of tid-bits of information. Did you know for example that Washington's greatest wealth came in the form of land in Ohio as gifts from the British government for his service in the French and Indian wars? That if Washington had not sided against the British and the rebellion not succeeded that Washington would have lost these valuable tracks of land as the British had planed to seed the land back to the Indian nations. Ellis does an effective job of tracking Washington's political development into a full-fledged Federalist and outlines his slow burn, which develops into a tremendous contempt for Jefferson and Madison's \\"Republican\\" anti-government views. And Ellis commends Washington's very tortured delayed decision to free his slaves in his will, thus securing a lasting legacy. So what's not to like? I personally feel is important that a first class biography provide a sense of the social, economic and overall world the subject lived in. And this is where I believe Ellis let's the reader down. It's fair to say this was not his intention in such a short biography, but for me I could have taken more pages to get a more rounded view of Washington's world. Also, remarkably Martha Washington burned all of her and George's letters, leaving no real history of their relationship. Unfortunate, Ellis points out. And would it not have been wonderful to have an idea what the nature of their relationship was? Overall this is an excellent book and remarkable that so much could be covered in so few pages. (I might point out that this is the only Biography of Washington I have read, so I can not compare it to say Richard Brookhiser's \\"Founding Father\\" which I understand is excellent.)"},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"Joseph Ellis writes and interesting, yet irreverent, portrait of our first president. If you are looking for an immature view of a man, this is your book. The facts presented are accurate. The words used are what you would expect from a college freshman who could care less about the subject, George Washington. Knowledgeable and accurate, yes.

I only hope there is more to follow."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"I read with great interest and enjoyment Mr. Ellis's book on our first president, but I was dumbfounded by the replacement of Parson Weems' delightful fable of Washington pitching a quarter across the Potomac with another, not equal, but just as preposterous one: George Washington threw a rock over the 210 ft. high Natural Bridge of Virginia. Let me put it this way (I'm not a physicist but a dad who has coached his son to pitch a baseball)if George was my son I would take him out of school, give up my practice of medicine, and devote my time to get him the largest contract ever seen for a major league prospect. Think of it. It would blow the scouts away. I would have a kid who could throw a rock 96 miles an hour at a 60 degree angle. The rock would go 230 feet in the air and the rock would land 530 feet from where he stood when it landed. Success of the throw depends on several conditions. The rock would have to be heavy enough to have essentially no wind resistance, and the trees on the bridge would have to be no taller than about ten feet. The rock has to be thrown about 83 miles an hour straight up to reach a height of 230 feet. At an easier throwing angle the rock has to be thrown faster to clear the bridge."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"Mr. Ellis cites wonderful books on Washington, some of them very comprehensive.

Washington's life but lacks substantive detail. For example, in the attempt to raise a standing U.S. army, Ellis notes that Alexander Hamilton is made second in command -- but provides no background other than Hamilton was an aide-de-camp to Washington.

I thoroughly enjoined Ellis' summary and analysis. It was refreshingly concise, but not too concise. It was also very revealing, and I learned a lot about Washington."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"I throughly enjoyed this book about Washington. Ellis has great detail and his narrative is wonderful. But the thing that most stood out was how the author focused in on Washington's dilemma related to his slaves. Washington had many slaves but he also had a desire to see freed.The catch was that he couldn't . . . You'll have to read the book to find out why. This author takes that challenge and how Washington deals with it and really helps us see a part of this famous founding father that we may not ever have seen before."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"At the end of the book I felt that I gained an idea of what Washington was really like. For me Mr. Ellis did bring stone to life. But also, unexpectedly, I found a little bit of comfort in reading this history in this time of war and trouble. Washington made a lot of mistakes, lost most of the battles but won the war anyway."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"This is an excellent picture of Washington, the man and the icon, although concentrating more on the man. Washington comes across as aloof in all of his relationships, and this is, the author suggests, a result of a terrible temper that Washington is constantly trying to keep in check.As far as the military man is concerned, it appears that much of Washington's success is due to luck and perseverance. He is not an exceptional tactician, in fact he made many mistakes. His personal courtage and his physical presence overcame many of his shortcomings. Like Lincoln, he was beloved by his troops. And like Eisenhower, he always worked towards the big picture and never faltered, despite all the problems being thrown at him from every direction.As a politician, he appeared to be honest and straightforward in his governance. His overriding aim was to maintain the independence of this new country, and to avoid any swing towards monarchy.If the story about the cherry tree was a fabrication, the author portrays this man as if the story was true. And even with his shortcomings, Washington was shown to deserve the epithet of father of the country and was the greatest of our leaders. I would expect that he would be proud of what he did if he visited us today, and that should be the bottom line of his greatness.The one fault that I found was that the book did read as more of a worship of the man than was necessary. The author had an abvious affection and admiration for his subject, but could Washington really have been that aloof and that distant in his personal relationships?In any case, I would certainly recommend this work."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"Joseph Ellis is an eloquent writer, and he tackles a most challenging subject -- the complex mind and will of our most important Founder.Because Washington cultivated his public image so carefully, it is difficult to know for certain what he truly believed, and what he just said or wrote for posterity. With the aid of the newly-catalogued Washington papers, Ellis makes a heroic effort to find the real man.One small quibble. I was hoping to learn more about Washington's religious beliefs. Some scholars have opined that Washington was a deeply pious man in private, but spoke as a Deist in public to avoid offense. Ellis states in passing, with no quotes or citations, that Washington was \\"never a deeply religious man\\" who thought of God as a \\"distant, impersonal force.\\" (Page 151) Perhaps Ellis' next book can explore this side of Washington more fully?"},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"This narrative captures the essence of the Early American Republic with flair. Ellis, in commanding prose, writes a thought provoking work on this esoteric figure in American History."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"This book is my first real encounter with \\"His Excellency.\\" My knowledge and exposure to Washington had been limited to the basics of high school American history and survey college courses. _His Excellency_ is a fascinating, captivating and objective look at the Legend, The Man-the one whose spirit still seems to hover over American daily life.Over these pages, I came to admire him more than the legendary figure who could not tell a lie. Washington was a man of incredible discipline and bravery. He had the knack for seeing himself as a history-maker and looking beyond the obvious. Sacrifice for a higher goal was Washington's forte. Yet, all in all-he was a man. He was often driven by self-interest and ego. He erred many times and lost many a battle. I never realized how his inner circle turned on him towards the end of his Presidency. Yet, in the face of every trial and adversity-The Man held his ground. He knew how to be quiet and he knew how to act. He was a bloody warrior and a cunning politician.I actually found great strength within his story, and found His Excellency to be more inspiring and a much larger-than-life character than the illusion we have painted. I came to realize through this moving book- His Excellency was The Real Deal."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"Whenever a new biography comes out on a figure as well-known and so often written about as George Washington, one must wonder what could be new or differently presented. Mr. Ellis' biography is primarily analysis rather than a year by year account of Washington's life. Due to its interpretive nature it reads more like an extended college lecture than a straight biography (that is a good thing).Mr. Ellis takes each major event in Washington's life, gives background and then investigates the motivating factors giving rise to Washington's actions and the great man's motives or thinking. Ellis' analysis is based primarily upon Washington's and others' correspondence.The author's presentation is very smooth. His interpretations are also extremely objective. He avoids the myth-making while avoiding equally fault-finding for the sake of magnifying imperfections. The insights into Washington's thinking and motivations are excellent. The Washington presented by Mr. Ellis is by no means perfect. However, through his interpretation of the general and president's life, one can see how Washington was seen as perfect by so many.This is a terrific addition to anyone's Washington or Revolutionary era library. Mr. Ellis did a fine job tackiling a subject so often done before. The biography is a fresh look at Washington."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"My daily commute is +/-3 hours, so I listen to many audio books.

Although it is not overly detailed, it does give a lot of information. However, if you already know a lot about Washington, I would suggest finding a different book as this will probably not give you any new information, although I suspect it would still be enjoyable."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"The essence of George Washington is everywhere in America. When we take out our billfold to pay a bill, there he is. When we watch the news of TV we always have reports from Washington. George Washington is the American version of Mount Olympas. He's there looking rather stoic on Mount Rushmore.Mr. Ellis goes into great detail in giving us a read on who George Washington really was. As Ellis has found out, George Washington was a rather ordinary person who was neither a military genius nor an intellectual. What Ellis discovers is a man of ambition and stamina who had the ability to learn from his mistakes and also capitalize on the mistakes of his adversaries.We find out that Washington realized that America would not survive without a strong central government base. He saw that a loose confederation of States would never survive nor prosper.Ellis probes into Washington's use of power and his laying the basic tenets of the office of the President. The fact that his title was Mr. President and not Your Excellency can be attributed to Washington never wanting to base the office as a Monarch. Washington also set the precedent of 2 term stays at the White House until it was broken by Franklin Roosevelt in the 1940 election. FDR did indeed tamper with Washington's precedent and Congress followed with the 22nd Amendment on February 26, 1951 limiting the President to 2 Terms in Office.As Michiko Kakutani states in her New York Times book review, this book by Joseph Ellis breaks no new ground, but \\"it nonetheless provides a lucid, often shrewd take on the man Mr. Ellis calls the \\"primus inter pares, the Foundingest Father of them all.\\" And it does so with admirable grace and wit.\\"Well I do agree Ms. Kakutani! Five Stars!!"},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"There are many review about this book so I will not go into a lot of detail.First I will talk about the narration. One reviewer was very critical. He said the pace was very slow. I liked the pace and the reader has a very clear voice. The other review also mention he could hear the readers stomach or something. There are places like on the third disk where the reader takes long pauses after a paragraph and you can hear distracting noises. I think it is the reader trying to swallow or bring moisture to his mouth. I don't think it is his stomach.I do think Ellis had an agenda and stuck to it, sometimes in spite of the facts. Ellis tries hard to bring Washington down from the God like status he believes many hold of Washington.Ellis tries claims that Washington was in love with a married woman, Mary Fairfax, just before marrying Martha. He states the evidence for this is just in three letters that aren't very clear. Yet he claims anyone disagreeing with his conclusion most have had their minds alreay made up.Ellis criticizes the plans British leaders made in the Braddock incident. He justifies this because they made these plans without knowledge of the Ohio region. Yet when Washington does the samething later on it is evidence of a personality flaw. \\"Washington felt he was superior to his superiors.\\" Washington had first hand experience, that almost took his life and did take the life of many close to him. I think he should be given a little more credit than Ellis does.Overall, however, I think Ellis did a good job. Ellis is human and I disagree with some of his conclusions. Readers need to realize historical writers are not divinely inspired and therefore are not free from error. Ellis did a good job in presenting the details and I just did not always agree with his conclusions.Ellis also had an objective. He wanted to demonstrate how Washington became the man that others would choose over what seemed like more qualified men like Jefferson, Franklin, Adams, and other to be our first president. He also wants to keep his work at a reasonable lenght."},{"Title":"HIS EXCELLENCY GEORGE WASHINGTON.","review":"I have learned so much about George Washington reading this book.

Her grandmother's old white house, with its peaked roofs and widow's walk overlooking the river, is too quiet, she thinks, when she arrives to visit there. But that's before she meets Neil, the inquisitive next-door neighbor, Patrick, the angry red-haired boy with the motor boat, and the dark, bearded stranger who has been hiding in the shrubbery, watching the house.And then there is Great-grandmother Althea who lives upstairs, secluded from the world, amid her collection of monsters and her jade treasures, her mind full of stories of China, where she lived long ago. There is a quick flash of warmth between the girl and the remarkable old lady -- and soon they share a secret that draws them closer together in the web of mysteries which surrounds the house.The hideous Chinese image that stands in the corner on the highest shelf in \\"Miss Althea's\\" room holds a memory and a message. Jan's father had tried to solve its mystery when he was a boy, but had never succeeded. Jan is determined that she will discover it -- but apparently someone else is trying to discover it too! The idol is stolen -- and a priceless jade carving disappears. Jan finds herself an unwilling eavesdropper at secret midnight conversations and in desperate need of an ally she can trust.A sea captain who carves models of sailing vessels, an ex-convict who has returned to Mystic to prove his innocence and try for a second chance, and a tape recorder that seems curiously modern in the historied old house, all provide complications in the exciting plot, as Jan's imagination and ingenuity unravel the mystery. There is a thrilling climax in the hold of the Charles W. Morgan, the last of the whaling ships, anchored at Mystic Seaport, before Great- grandmother Althea and Jan discover the secret of the \\"happy heart\\" and the angry idol reveals its long-hidden mystery."},{"Title":"Rackstraw Downes","review":"Rackstraw Downes is a unique artist. He must have been born with the patience of Job or simply endless concentration patterns, as every thing the man draws, etches, or paints represents the most painstakingly observed detail and transfer to paper or canvas.Though his name is well known to museums and art collectors, the general public is less aware of his prodigious gifts. This superb book should change that. Sanford Schwartz is a gifted writer and his essay on the work and the man is not only eminently readable, it also informs about the clarity of Downes' execution of his landscapes and vistas of cities. Robert Storr contributes another essay that places Rackstraw Downes in the pantheon with other representational artists and surrounds his evaluation with fine art history writing.But of course the glory of this large-scale volume is in the reproduction plates of the paintings and drawings. Generous space is given to define details so important to understanding Downes' gift. And the extended panorama paintings are given fluid space to unfold so that the reader can slowly absorb the incredible amount of visual information Downes gives us.This is one of the collectable artist monographs - in content, in visuals, and in design.

He does not use photography. Most of his paintings are amazing wide panoramas. Mr. Downes achieves wonderful painterly realism which is quite different than photo real painting.The book is laid out horizontally to give maximum exposure to the wide paintings. It is very nicely produced with readable type, numerous color and B & W pictures and articles, a bio and other data that fans of his work will enjoy.Overall, there is nothing that distracts from the purpose of showing off these wonderful artworks.Steve FrenkelMarietta, GA"},{"Title":"Rackstraw Downes","review":"This book contains art by Rackstraw Downes which is more likely to be taken for photographs than the paintings that they are.

What tools of our age can be used to truly stand for its time? Jackson Pollock,master of 'drip' technique feels,\\"The modern painter cannot express this age, the airplane, the atom bomb, the radio, in the old forms of the Renaissance or of any past culture\\".

Although in some respects the author sacrifices depth for brevity the points that the Rabbi makes are still poignant. Structurally, Adler takes us through the byzantine world of the Talmud by illustrating how this encylopedic work is divided. The first division is between the Gemara and Mishna.To put it concisely the Mishna is a commentary on the Torah and the Gemara is a commentary on the Mishna.The second division is between Halacha and Agada. Halacha is jewish law similar to that of Sharia in Islam and Agada is about the mystical folklore that has come to define the spiritual realm of the Talmud.One of the most important points Elder brings up, that maybe of interest to those engaged in Christian-Jewish Dialouge, is on Rabbinical teaching differs largely from Church Teaching.1. Credo Quia Absurdum Est. Translated is \\"I believe that which is unreasonable,\\" However in Judaism the learned Gentile is to be honored above that of an ignorant high priest. Furthermore the empasis on the study of Scripture has \\"helped keep judaism intellectually vigorous and alert.\\"2 Extra Eccleasiaam Nulla Salus, (No salvation outside of the church) Alder contends that the attempt to translate this into Hebrew is not feasible because words such as \\"Salvation\\" and \\"church\\" are epistemolgically rooted in Church theology. Instead the concept of Salvation isnt limited to an institution nor a paticular religion. In fact the inclusvity and appreciation of followers of other faiths is expressed in the Rabbinical phrase Hasideri Urmot Ha-Olam. Tanna D bei Eliyahu p. 48 testifys to this sense of religious pluralism.3. Another intersting point of religious intersection between Christian theology and Rabbinical teaching brought up by the author is amplified in Romans 13:1 where the biblical proscriptions seemingly suggest that Kings and all forms of Government are from God. Although the Jewish concept Dina D'amalchuta dina might seem to be in agreement with Paul it isnt. The laws of the land are to be obeyed only inso far as their teaching does not harm their religion or is not constiutionally constructed.Lastly Alder argues that The Talmud is not only subjected to reason nor Passion but is a harmonization of the two. This is the meaning behind the Deutronimic verse you must worship God with all your Mind and Heart which is physically symbolized by the Tefilin."},{"Title":"Nonviolent Alternative, The","review":"Certainly no one more than Father Thomas Merton himself, Trappist monk and hermit and writer, would be more concerned by the excesses of \\"Tomolatry\\" which emerged after his tragic assassination in 1968. Nevertheless, he remains the most critical, brilliant, intelligent, wise, courageous, instructive, ethical, moral and faith-based voice in our nation, and his writings increasingly teach us essential lessons for living in Peace and in Christ.As we today witness the ineluctable surge of endless and counter-productive military violence which cannot possibly construct a stable and peaceful society in Iraq, we need now to remember this informative, ethical, moral, and faith based collection of essays by Father Merton. He as so often writes with such profound moral and Christian principle that he could be writing for us today. Would that he could!This important collection of Father Merton's prayers, meditations and exhortations, originally published posthumously as Thomas Merton On Peace, opens with a lengthy, scholarly and brilliant essay by the great Gordon C. Zahn, defining the terms and raising the issues which the writings of Merton address throughout this substantial book. Zahn's essay in itself is sufficient feast for reflection on our times and on our individual states of grace, yet it merely serves like Virgil in Dante's trilogy to guide and introduce us to the wonders and truths which lie beyond.The collection of Father Merton writings are divided in three parts: Principles of Peace (eighteen essays), The Nonviolent Alternative (fifteen essays, including Blessed are the Meek: The Christian Roots of Nonviolence), and a series of Incidental Writings, including the Chant to be used in Processions around a site with Furnaces, of which the final line calls to us today: \\"Do not think yourself better because you burn up friends and enemies with long range missiles without ever seeing what you have done\\"This excellent collection ends with a Prayer for Peace which ought to be required reading at every Catholic liturgy this season, as originally read in the US House of Representatives on Wednesday of Holy Week in 1962, some 45 years ago April 12.

The book specifically targets the topics of nuclear warfare, the Cold War, and the arms race.The reader will likely find the book at least slightly redundant of itself. The book contains constant references to catholic ideology -a fact which many non Catholics will likely find grating. However, the book challenges the logical processes of the reader and forces him or her into contemplations that the reader has unlikely grappled with before. The book presents a profound introduction to Merton as well as his rhetoric."},{"Title":"Nonviolent Alternative, The","review":"Father Merton before his martyrdom felt compelled ever more clearly to speak the Truth of Peace, Contemplation, Compassion and Pacifism as universal Christian practice. During the year of his martyrdom several very Christian voices for peace shared his fate, as during that year of imperialist and profitable warfare peace was not in fashion any more than now.Which is why we now may read this prophetic and Catholic book to grow clear and strong and consoled, to recall our Faith, to practice our Faith, to find the path to our Faith in Jesus Christ who declared He gives us Peace, His peace he leaves to us, you orders us to Love our Enemies and do good to those who hate us.The Reverend Father Thomas Merton remains the most critical, brilliant, intelligent, wise, courageous, instructive, ethical, moral and faith-based voice in our nation, and his writings increasingly teach us essential lessons for living in Peace and in Christ.As we today witness the ineluctable surge of endless and counter-productive military violence which cannot possibly construct a stable and peaceful society in Iraq, we need now to remember this informative, ethical, moral, and faith based collection of essays by Father Merton.

As a home chef dedicated to gourmet and quality cookery, I have been studying the primary text and occasionally seeking some structure to my own experiments and studies. While I don't have the liberty of following the text from Chapter 1 to the end (I can't afford to not cook for my family and that requires some compromise), the study guide does a great job of summarizing the points and lessons in each chapter.As a study guide, this is not really useful on it's own, so I believe that it should only be purcahsed with The Profesional Chef. If you don't, you will be woefully disappointed.

The book covers WAS 5.0 and 5.1, highlighting the differences. It covers almost every OS: UNIX, Linux, Windows and Z/OS. A differentiating factor from other books is that the authors focus on Network Deployment throughout, starting with chapter 2.One thing to note is that there is a lot of duplicated information. Five (out of 26) chapters have separate chapters for distributed and Z/OS. The remaining 16 chapters, sprinkle distributed and Z/OS differences within. In a way, it is two books in one. However, if you are only using one type of OS, the book is thicker and more expensive than necessary.The authors are quite thorough in discussing most options. They also refer to the InfoCenter, papers and redbooks for more details. There are also many tips and gotchas in each chapter. The step-by-step instructions and screenshots are very helpful.A running example shows the steps for deploying, configuring and maintaining a sample application. The app is of sufficient complexity to seem real. Tools such as MQ, ASDK and wsadmin are shown in parallel.The authors intend for each chapter to stand alone. As a result, there is a fair amount of repetition. Aside of one dependency on a future chapter, the book reads well linearly too. This book serves a good reference and I recommend it to those maintaining both distributed and Z/OS systems."},{"Title":"IBM&reg; WebSphere&reg; Application Server for Distributed Platforms and z/OS&reg;: An Administrator's Guide","review":"For several years, IBM has built up and refined WebSphere as one of its flagship products. Here is its latest sysadmin manual. The size of which is a good indicator of the capabilities built into it.Maybe the biggest change from earlier versions is how much of the code base for versions running under (linux, unix, MS Windows) has now been unified with that for z/OS. The immediate and ongoing beneficiary of this is IBM itself; greatly simplifying maintenance and extensions. Opaque to outsiders. But to a WebSphere sysadmin, you also benefit. Because basically most operations are true across these operating systems, it increases your marketability.The only minor omission I could find in the text is that the chapter on Web Services could need enhancement. Or, rather, that WebSphere itself have greater Web Services ability. The latter field is changing rapidly and perhaps WebSphere deliberately wants to stay a pace behind, in order to see what new features are actually useful, before implementing them. For example, Business Process Execution Language is rising, as a more expressive language than WSDL, to describe Web Services. If BPEL persists, perhaps the next version of WebSphere might support it?"},{"Title":"IBM&reg; WebSphere&reg; Application Server for Distributed Platforms and z/OS&reg;: An Administrator's Guide","review":"\\"IBM WebSphere Application Server for Distributed Platforms and z/OS\\" is a wonderful compendium, very readable, supplies lots of background information and puts good light on the different platform implementations of WebSphere.

While I don't think that you'd find one shop running WAS on both platforms (although I could be wrong), I still found the comparison between both systems interesting. There is definitely a different mindset between the two, and the comparisons will help you understand the side you don't work with. I was impressed with the level of detail included also. If you were sitting down with the WAS CDs and this book, you'd stand a very good chance of getting the system up and running, as well as having some troubleshooting material to help you out over the hard parts. The only down side of this book is that WAS 6 has already been released, so it could be that the book is living on borrowed time. New shops will probably go straight to 6, while shops already running WAS on 5 may be stable, in which case this book becomes more of a reference manual than an aid to installation.People running WAS on distributed platforms have a number of books and IBM redbooks to choose from. The options for z/OS platforms seem to be much more limited in terms of documentation and material, so I think this book would be far more valuable to those people than to the distributed networking side. Not to say it's not good for distributed information, but I acknowledge they have more options to choose from.If WAS is part of your professional existence, this would be a good book to have on your shelf."},{"Title":"IBM&reg; WebSphere&reg; Application Server for Distributed Platforms and z/OS&reg;: An Administrator's Guide","review":"A must for any WebSphere Administrator working on large distributed systems!

Bates","review":"In our family my great aunt was the keeper of this rare piece of glass pressed into a frame, not even as big as a deck of cards. It was the likeness of my great-great grandfather, a supposed captain in some Confederate unit, captured in an ambrotype, a primitive form of photograph. I peered at him as a child as he proudly gazed back at me from more than a century ago, his hat flamboyantly cocked, beard prominent, and pistols visible at his waist.We never knew what the war was like for him, the details of his life blurred by a sketchy oral tradition: Didn't know what he thought about the cause in which he was engaged; what he thought about his fellow soldiers; about the Union; about his family. We didn't know why he came back home to Arkansas, so we were told, in the middle of the war, only to die. Had he been wounded or taken ill? Had he deserted, or just walked away on a long odyssey home, as Charles Frazier's Cold Mountain soldier had?These past few days, though, have offered a vivid and authentic picture of how life must have been for my forebear. Richard Lowe, Regents Professor of History at the University of North Texas, pulled all the strands of that world together in this book.Captain, then Major, then Lieutenant Colonel Bates' letters and diary entries, along with Lowe's invaluable geographical markers and chronological waystations, give us a true picture of the trials -- physical, mental and emotional -- that must have weighed heavily on those young men in the maelstrom of war.Bates' own psyche tilts at the eternal and epic questions of Everyman's life and death throughout the book. In some letters, the young Bates playfully teases his future wife Mootie. In others, the darker hand of war and combat color his mind. His lightheartedness with Mootie stands out against the grisly accounts of terrible battles and revenge. In one he reports that his men \\"set a good many\\" former slaves who had gone over to the Union side \\"to stretching hemp,\\" a euphemism for hanging.As Bates' letters and diaries continue throughout the war, his own accounts of rumors brought into his camp and his joy at optimistic accounts of victories reported leave us pitying his soul, for he knows not yet of the war's inexorable grinding on the Confederacy. Lowe's ample and informative historical notes and charts force us to twist privately in our seats as we read, unable from this vantage point to even vicariously enlighten or encourage Bates in his travels and battles through the Indian Territory, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Tennessee.Bates would hear of nothing to dampen the spirits of the Confederate cause, evidenced by a letter to his sister, a scalding scolding, after she had written to him a particularly depressing letter. \\"Why all this gloom,\\" he asks. \\"You permit your imagination to conjure up a thousand dangers &amp; difficulties &amp; causes for trouble that have no existence in reality.\\" Then, after a tub-thumping sermon on reasons for bearing up under the strain: \\"Make an effort to appear cheerful at all times - and making the effort to appear so will soon really make you feel so.\\"Bates' optimism bears up even when he contemplates continuation of the war after the fall of Vicksburg and Atlanta.Analyses of the deeper reasons for the conflict pepper Bates' writings, based many times on his reading of letters and papers captured from Union soldiers. Then, as if it is all a joke, he relates a story of how the belligerents, negotiating in 1861, came to terrible disagreement over which side would take Mississippi. Abraham Lincoln, who in this tale really didn't want anything to do with Mississippi, reluctantly offers to take half, then precipitating the war, since the South could not bear to have only half. Bates despised Mississippi. On his second trip there, he was obliged to admit that his Confederate troops were treated better than before, the locals having got a dose of the Yankee medicine since his last visit, a medicine which he felt had taught them to respect the presence of their own Confederate troops.Bates' use of American slang still rings true in the ear today, with his talk of having the \\"blues\\" from time to time, but his prose is undeniably pristine and proper. His take on the ineptitude of Confederate leaders is poignant and his analysis of politics is deadly sharp.Possibly while on a visit back home, he, like so many soldiers in other conflicts, left a code with his friend Mootie, which allowed him to pass along information to her which could have compromised the troops' mission have it been general knowledge. Lowe includes the two instances of the code in use, along with a facsimile of the actual key used in deciphering. How exciting and intimate it must have been to think of passing along privileged information along to his future partner.Bates also follows the lead of many other soldiers, finding God, or \\"taking religion,\\" after his brush with death and subsequent injury. He assures his mother that if he were to die, he would be reunited with her one day in the heavens.The war for Bates ended with his inability to return home for a while. He spent time wandering Mississippi, in all likelihood working through events that changed him from a young innocent to a vengeful, physically shattered man.Bates was lucky enough to have survived a mini&eacute; ball wound to the mouth, and lived a productive life for some time after the war, unlike my \\"Captain,\\" who died before the war was over. Even so, I, and many others who may have wondered about their forebear in their own carefully passed-along photo, now have something to go on, something that reveals the real world of a Confederate soldier, the hopes, the joys, the wrenching twists of morals and psyche."},{"Title":"A Texas Cavalry Officer's Civil War: The Diary and Letters of James C. Bates","review":"&amp;#65279; The day I learned of Richard Lowe's publication of the diary and letters of James C. Bates I ordered the book. I read Bates' diary and letters first then re-read the entire book. I was fascinated! In his letters, Bates reveals his feelings much more often than most Civil War soldiers. I have often wondered how he survived such a dreadful wound. His description of forcing a tube down his horridly damaged throat would make anyone cringe. I knew a descendant of James C. Bates had the major's Civil War papers, but I had no idea where to find that person. This book is a valuable contribution to the history of a band of brave and dedicated young men who deserve recognition. Their brigade, made up of the First Texas Legion, the Third, the Sixth, and the Ninth Texas Cavalry, is the only Texas cavalry brigade to serve east of the Mississippi. They were transferred from the TransMississippi to Corinth in April 1862 and remained in the Confederate West to the end of the war. In the Official Records they were known as the Texas Cavalry Brigade and later in the war as Ross's Cavalry Brigade. I have a special interest in the Ninth Texas Cavalry and would have paid a large ransom for Lowe's book a couple of years ago. I am elated to add it to my library. My mother remembered two uncles, Reuben and Jesse Rogers, who served with the Ninth. Her stories and a few old family records started my research on the regiment ten years ago. In January of this year Avon Books published my book about the Ninth and Ross's Brigade - All Afire to Fight - The Untold Tale of the Civil War's Ninth Texas Cavalry.

A good introduction to women in the Christian tradition and in the mystical tradition, one recommended to anyone, especially the intrigued non-specialist."},{"Title":"Enduring Grace: The Lives of Six Women Mystics","review":"A wonderfully inspiring book that makes one hungry for more! There is enough here to provide a good picture of each of the women described, but inevitable, you will want to go out and get more material on your favorite one or two (in my case, Teresa of Avila and &quot;crazy&quot; Mechthild.) The work is not at all full of feminist &quot;prejudice&quot; (though its modern perspective was obviously too much for fearful conservative &quot;Frances&quot; below). On the contrary, it shows excuisite respect for the full potential of a compassionate, truly &quot;Catholic&quot; -- all-embracing -- Christianity."},{"Title":"Enduring Grace: The Lives of Six Women Mystics","review":"as a quick glance at the other reviews will demonstrate, this book can elicit widely varying responses from readers. why so much disagreement among reviewers? i can't say for certain, but here's my guess.on the plus side, this is a short and informal introduction to seven brilliant female mystics of the middle ages. there are few books that bring together the lives of such compelling and powerful women under one cover, as any one of them can--and have--form the basis for a detailed individual biography. in fact, at least one of my stars reflects the importance of and accessibility to these phenomenal mystics. it is clear that the author deeply (and rightly) respects and admires each of these magnificent women, and has done a good deal of homework in learning about their lives and times. she writes with an amiable voice and attempts to give a flavor of the process involved in historical research.on the not-so-plus side (or is it?), the author is not a scholar of either medieval history or feminist theory, though these are the main scholarly fields from which she attempts to draw a picture of her subjects. if you enjoy a more casual approach to learning about people in history, you may group this point with the pluses. although the chapters are not overlengthy (the whole text itself is not much more than 200 pages), there is less organization and more meandering than is the norm in biography. again, this informal arrangement may be a plus for some readers, a no-no for others. although there is not a great deal of fresh insight concerning the lives of these remarkable mystics, and not a wide sampling of their writing, you do get an initial taste (this is meant to be an introduction, after all). the writing style is not the most inspired or graceful (and sometimes the author's intended use of vocabulary seems to get away from her), but some readers may prefer a more plain approach. one more significant con: there are, as another reviewer noted, plenty of generic feminist ideas sprinkled about. while an informed and involved feminist view would be fitting in this context, here there appears not to be much independent reflection behind the statements, and so they add little of import and at times feel a bit tacked on.in a nutshell, this is a congenial, but not profound, book about truly life-altering women, which can make a big impact on those seeking concise portraits and who prefer a less formal and scholarly approach. if this is what you seek, you may feel like a well-informed and intelligent friend dropped in to chat with you about some truly great people. on the other hand, this is not the book for those who seek revelatory insights into the mystics, masterful writing, or a practical framework for bringing a mystical understanding into one's life. if this is what you seek, you may feel instead like you are reading a book report by an enthused, diligent, and well-intentioned friend. (for those who would like to incorporate selections of women mystics' writings into a spiritual practice, Mary Penrose's \\"Refreshing Water from Ancient Wells: The Wisdom of Women Mystics\\" is one good starting point)."},{"Title":"Enduring Grace: The Lives of Six Women Mystics","review":"Enduring Grace presents the special contributions of women mystics. It gives a clear and realistic discription of the women, their lives and the times in which they lived. In doing this, they come alive as real people who faced day to day difficulties, no different than the modern day reader. In regard to some of their more unusual behavior, Flinders encourages the reader to view the mystics with compassion and understanding. Flinders illucidates how very ordinary women transformed themselves into extraordinary individuals who made extraordinary contributions. She further illistrates how these women belong to us all and gives every female reader a legacy which she can claim as her own."},{"Title":"Enduring Grace: The Lives of Six Women Mystics","review":"This book provides inspiring insights into two subjects which are rarely given fair analysis: (1) women saints and (2) the mystical experience. By definition the mystical experience is difficult to explain or analyze in words, but the author's approach and beautiful references help make the experiences of these saints come to life -- and these saints are not the life-denying, intellectual complex, emotionally stunted type, but the divinely inspired type. I would not call the author's perspective feminist but one free of conventional masculine/church biases. I will reread this book often."},{"Title":"Enduring Grace: The Lives of Six Women Mystics","review":"I read this book for the first time several years ago, and find myself pulling it off my shelf time and again.

I fell in love with Teresa of Avila as a spiritual &quot;mentor&quot; in these pages, and have gone on to read several of her works."},{"Title":"Enduring Grace: The Lives of Six Women Mystics","review":"I will admit to getting upset when any book of this caliber seems somehow to lose ground so to speak. It is one of the few books among thousands out there that has the capacity to transform your perspective of yourself and the world not to omit your faith in God. Too many books on the subject of Beloved Saints seem to only focus on their masterful greatness to which I could never relate on any level [as a woman being so terribly flawed (yet devoted to my faith of Catholicism)]. This book ever so eloquently and exquisitely reads like a dream and shows how these spectacularly popular Saints had trials and troubles aplenty within-and-without as mortals just like you and me. My favorite cameo is of one Saint who regretted that: she could not bring good will to good works....This is a stunner of a book. A classic for all time. Thank you, Carol Lee Flinders. I believe I am a-little-bit-better of a person - because of your book."},{"Title":"Enduring Grace: The Lives of Six Women Mystics","review":"Reading through the book Enduring Grace was quite a treat. In it we are exposed to seven women who each in their own way experienced the spiritual life in a profound way. Sadly, the tendency for Christian History is to focus on major events, or on the major influence of a male leader. We hear of the church fathers, the reformers, the men who sacrificed themselves, who added great wisdom to the life of the church. We do not hear as much about the women who have been such an integral part of the Community of Christ. Yet, one cannot help but think that women have been as important to the development of the church as have men from the very beginning. Through their prayers, their wisdom, their courage, and, yes, sometimes their teaching the church has moved forward and has matured in its understanding of the Triune God.The seven women mystics which are discussed give to us an understanding how the Spirit works in the lives of all believers. We find that there is not a single &quot;type&quot; of person that seems to exhibit a spiritual intensity. Rather, we are shown that a variety of personalities and temperaments all have a place in the spiritual life. What is common to all, however, is a burning desire to come close to God, and experience the fullness of his life in every way. It was interesting to read the initial description of each woman, hearing of their backgrounds and the circumstances of their entering a convent (which was essentially the only spiritual office open to women). As the particulars end, however, we get a sense of a common experience, one which seems to be influenced by the era and locale in which they lived, but has a timeless characteristic. They are women who forsake utterly the trappings of this world and find their way into Eternity while still living. Their thoughts, desires, writings seem to express the longing for what they have been given a taste of, and the ability to fight and overcome those encumbrances which might draw them away. This fight, however, is not seen as onerous, but rather there is almost a natural grace to be spiritual people. In other words their lives do not seem to reflect the result of intense battles to achieve spirituality, rather they seem to be people whom the Spirit chooses to work through and gives them grace to live as they do. This is not to say that their lives were without struggle, for we read also of their refreshing humanity and difficulties in living this life as holy people. It seems as though there is an inner storm which drives these women to seek further the place of Christ in their lives. But, the taste of heaven which these women have been given allows them to overcome any hindrance and seek further contact with the Divine. This taste of heaven leads each mystic in a slightly different direction and emphasis, one as a visionary, one as helper of the sick and needy, one as a spiritual leader for communities, but it is the yearning for the fullness of life which drives these women and helps them to overcome without regret the offerings of this world.My own tendency is to relegate the experiences and thoughts of these women to a separate category of Christian life, to say that they were the products of their own religious climate and while inspirational, they are not models for life. Yet, as I reflect on this I begin to sense that these woman are not totally unique in the life of the church, and that even today there are those who reflect the qualities which were exemplified in these women. Definitely, there are points at which I might disagree with their theology, but their lives offer a call to each and every Christian, female and male. They show us the fullness of life even in and through suffering which comes from being fully devoted in every aspect of life to the life and love of Christ. They encourage us to work through the often mundane experiences and seek how God is working in our own hearts. These women were not simply historical curiosities, but rather they exhibit how the Spirit works outside of our own societal boundaries in every time to raise up people to be lights to those around them. Certainly, these seven women were influenced by their own eras and contexts, but we see that the Spirit in them was not, and worked and continues to work in the lives of those who seek after God with all their hearts, minds, and souls.While I am personally wary about how these women can be applied to some kind of nebulous &quot;spirituality&quot;, for certainly what defines them is their distinctly Christian beliefs, this book is an enormously good introduction to these interesting women. To know them, though, is to share what they all believed, lacking that leaves a bit out in their final analysis, which is my only critique of Flinders."},{"Title":"Enduring Grace: The Lives of Six Women Mystics","review":"If you read &quot;Five Stages of the Soul&quot; and were fascinated by his reference to the women mystics of the Rhineland, &quot;Enduring Grace&quot; will give you a ggood overview of how they all developed.

Martin's AN AMERICAN ADVENTURE IN BOOKBURNING (AAAB)is instructive on different forms of censorship in \\"The Land of the Free.\\" This small book is a good start for the uninitiated in learning that in spite of a Bill of Rights, American political leaders and, sad to say, the American people willingly surrendered their birth rights of free speech and free press.Martin presents lists of books that were banned during World War I that were written before Americans entered this useless war. In other words, books about European history and the origins of this war that were written prior to U.S. entry into World War I had to be banned according to government authorities.What is interesting is the willingness of librarians and academics to actively enlist their \\"expertise\\" in censoring books and pamphlets that might actually cause Americans to think. Since the British were \\"allies,\\" books critical of British oppression of Ireland were supressed even though they had nothing to do with World War I. The range of censored books was expanded well beyond anything that had to do with World War I.Martin shows that the efforts to ban books and pamphlets was high-handed and based on bullying dissenters by cowards who had to outnumber any opponent by ten to one before they had the \\"courage\\" to use physical violence against peaceful dissenters. One group that caused much discomfort to the official \\"do-gooders\\" consisted of dedicated Jehovah's Witnesses. These people wrote pamphlets and books that constently appeared and reappeared in libraries in spite of offical do-gooders' attempts to keeps such \\"dangerous\\" materials from their sacred shelves.Martin metnions that just prior to U.S. entry into World War II, publishers supressed books before publication by refusal to permit such books enter the market. Any writer whose work slipped by the publishers faced condemnation or even failed trials for sedition for expressing an honest assessment of events. In other words, censorship prior to and during World War II was based more on prevention of publication rather than suppression during this war.The last section of the AAAB is titled \\"A Beginner's Manual for Apprentice Book Burners\\" is worth the price of the book. Martin presents titles of books that are usually not assigned in any academic setting but are well worth reading if one wants to know a fundamentally honest view of politics, history, economics, etc. The titles include books that have been consigned to \\"The Orwellion Memory Hole\\" but have been attractive enough to have survived either censorship and neglect. This reviewer has many of these books and finds them well written and informative.The tragic aspect of this is that the American people actually tolerate and even support being imposed upon when there are drives to keep them ingorant. This is particularly sad among people who are supposed to take pride in their freedom and civil liberties. What Martin makes clear is that too often there is little resistence to censorship. The only saving grace is that government censors are so stupid and inept that dissenters are overlooked by such jackasses. Americans' desire for self-consorship is in line that the American people have raised thoughtlessness to a virtue."},{"Title":"An American Adventure in Bookburning: In the Style of 1918","review":"One of the results of the anti-German hate fest that swept the U.S during WWI was the American government's attempt to ban as \\"German propaganda\\",certain books about the origins of that war and related issues.As Martin goes through the list of banned books,it will become obvious that calling any of the books \\"German propaganda\\" was quite a stretch.This is an important book about an episode of American history that is now almost entirely forgotten."},{"Title":"Caddo Indians: Where We Come From","review":"I found this writing to be an excellent source of information and reference material.

I am sorry that I didn't know to read One Night of Passion first, though - but didn't find it a stumbling block for me. I was able to follow the story and get into the characters well enough. Lady Diana Fordham lost her heart to Marquis of Templeton (Temple for short) a long time ago. She had hope he would notice but he never seemed to come around. At one time she decided to move on and marry his cousin only to withdraw her agreement for engagment. Her heart wasn't in it. Now ten years later Diana sets up her own elopement with a scandrel of the Ton and everyone is shocked. Her father offers her hand in marriage to the first man that is able to bring her back. Temple has no design to go get her until his secret employer orders him to go get her and see that she is married as soon as possible. He leaves with no plans on being the one that she marries. Boy, is he fooled! Things get to hopping! Temple discovers that the French are after Diana with plans of their own, Diana's fiance is murdered, and Temple is accused of doing it. Oh... the story gets even better. In the middle of all that is going on, Diana forces Temple to admit his love for her. I think my favorite part is when Diana shows up at a Masquarade Ball dressed as a greek goddess only wearing the sheer curtains from Temple's rented room drapped over her naked body and a face mask.

Now Temple is a man with a secret--no mere society fop whose greatest skill is tying an elegant cravat, the outwardly affable Temple is actually a skilled spy for the Crown. When Lady Diana is reported kidnapped and suspected to be on her way to Gretna Green to wed, Temple is assigned to see her brought home . . . and married at once to the first available man he can find. Temple is certain that man will not be him, but Diana has other plans.A delightful battle of wills and desires ensues, made all the more enjoyable by an ongoing chase by Napoleon's cronies that sends the pair into hiding and on the run across England.

The man who broke her heart ten years ago had just run out of time and now Diana was ready to launch an elaborate plan to storm his defenses and bring him to task! She devises a plan to make it appear that she has been kidnapped by the worst sort of rake she could find - knowing in her heart that Temple would come to rescue her. Her father, Lord Fordham, raises the alarm that she has been abducted and announces that whoever rescues her will be the man Diana will marry her - and so the race was on!The Marquis of Templeton, known as the \\"Temple\\", appears as an \`idiot fop' to most observers. He has used this ruse to disguise his true identity as a very courageous and effective spy. The Foreign Office assigns him the task of rescuing the chit and see her married to one of two suitors that have asked for her hand in marriage. Temple would rather not have to do this as the less time spent in Diana's company the better. He has always secretly been in love with Diana but through some very convoluted logic (it's a guy thing), born of stubbornness and rebellion, has distanced himself from her - convinced that he would place her in danger. Unfortunately, danger has caught up with Diana, in the form of, and from a source that no one would have suspected as Temple and the \`heiress bride stealers' race on to Gretna Green.STEALING THE BRIDE should steal the hearts of most Regency romance readers. The last ditch effort of the strong and resourceful lead heroine, Lady Diana, to bring Temple up to snuff was for me a lovely plot that I truly enjoyed. The supporting characters were delightful and charmingly amusing and the re-introduction of characters from her previous novels has me now scurrying around looking for the earlier related publications.

However, Diana does not want a spouse, as her heart was broken years ago by a man she still loves.All hell breaks loose when her father frantically announces that a rogue has kidnapped his daughter taking her to Gretna Green. Most of the aristocracy cannot believe an old maid like Diana can be abducted so they ignore Lord Fordham's rant. However, some reconsider when he announces the man who saves Diana will marry her.The Marquis of Templeton, known as the &quot;Temple&quot; of foppish good fashion, is upset because secretly he loves Diana. However he rationalizes that he must not act on his feelings because of the danger of his profession as a spy that might place his beloved in danger. The Foreign Office orders a reluctant and irate Temple to insure that Diana is rescued and safely married. When he catches up to her he finds an incredibly brilliant counter move by a strategist who makes Napoleon look like a bonehead as the clever ploy shakes his heart to the core.STEALING THE BRIDE will steal the hearts of Regency romance readers due to the final desperate fling of the heroine.

This discipline provides Weidmann with his \\"take-off\\" point as he focuses on the limitations of clinical psychology in its unwilingness to include spirit as a factor in therapy.

We know more about the extinct Mammoth than some living species because there are so many well preserved frozen in the ground, and the close relation with living elephants tells us a lot about behavior.This is a third edition (1994, 2000, 2007) and some of the information is extremely recent, for example the best preserved Mammoth ever found was in early 2007, and there is a picture included!"},{"Title":"Mammoths Giants of the Ice Age","review":"I have given this book four stars, primarily because it is so well illustrated, and that it DOES contain the main arguments currently extant regarding mammoth extinctions, and is well-written as far as it goes. That said, given that this is a revised (third) edition, I would expect that careful editing to bring in the new material would bring to light some glaring contradictions and sway the discussion one way or another. There is a lot of mention in passing of the semi-mythical 'mammoth steppe,' there is essentially no discussion at all of the unique inter-relationship of the mammoth to that particular environment. In other words, the mammoth largely CREATED and maintained the mammoth steppe, much like the African elephant maintains the savannahs of Africa. The experimental efforts of Dr. Zimov in Siberia over the past few years have made that quite clear. Once you have that fact firmly in mind, if you look at the contraction of the mammoth steppe in the post-glacial period, it is obvious that this is representing not a 'shrinking environment that will ultimately doom the mammoth,' but in fact clearly represents the decimation of the mammoth through hunting or other vectors, with a contracting environment resulting (with unsurprisingly, the last vestige of such environment ending up on Wrangel Island). As mammoths lived in lots of environments besides the 'mammoth steppe,' it is clear that the mammoth was not at all dependent on either the climate, or the food resources of the mammoth steppe, but that the steppe was in fact dependent upon the presence of the mammoth.Carrying this discussion further, the most obvious vector for extinction is clearly hunting by humans. The book devotes a large portion to documenting extensive evidence of human hunting of mammoths, with over 70 sites across the Russian plain where not just individual houses, but entire communities were essentially built on the bones of mammoths, mammoth bones burned as fuel (and they have to be relatively fresh, or they won't burn), huge caches dug in the permafrost and filled with mammoth meat and bones, sites in the US where mammoths have been slaughtered, butchered and eaten, with stone points left in the vertebrae and between the ribs and charcoal pits scattered around them... Yet for some reason, this does not give 'sufficient' evidence for extensive hunting by humans?Finally, while the book is very much limited to the various species of mammoth alone, for future editions it might be wise to include an extensive section on the various mastodons of the time as well. This is important for several reasons. First, during all of the Pleistocene (and earlier), the mastodons/gomphotheres formed a distinct proboscidean parallel form to the mammoths, exploiting environments not generally favored by them, and vice versa. While mammoths generally preferred more open environments for grazing (and knocking down trees to obtain it), the mastodons were primarily browzers that preferred forests. Thus, when the climate changes, favoring either expansion of grasslands, or expansion of forests, either the mammoths or the mastodons would benefit, and thus proboscideans of one type or another continue. An examination of the impact of modern African elephants of the forest species gives some good clues as to the impact of large proboscideans on the dense forest, and its plants and animals as well that could be easily transferred to the mastodons of North and South America (much of the jungle of West Africa is so dense that the interior would be essentially impenetrable if not for the existence of extensive 'game trails' created by forest elephants).Further, the mastodon/gomphotheres lived not only in North America, but extensively in South America as well (where they form a primary item on the menu of early human sites), living in jungles, upland environments, as well as the pampas further South where mammoths never reached (already occupying and exploiting the environments there). In Asia, a similar situation occured with Stegodons and more modern elephants occupying the heavily forested South, while the mammoths stayed further North. Yet in all cases, all but modern elephants were wiped out in a matter of just a few thousand years, even though all forms had been in occupance for more than a million years previously! There IS only one 'enemy' here, and that is US!If you are looking for a good overview of mammoths, their descent and a good overview of current knowledge in a distinctly non-technical manner, I can recommend this book highly. If you are looking for deeper insights, then I am afraid you will have to either look elsehwere, or wait for an updated edition. Check out 'Twilight of the Mammoths,' by Paul S. Martin for a good examination of environmental factors at the end of the Pleistocene for more information."},{"Title":"Mammoths Giants of the Ice Age","review":"I foundMammoths: Giants of the Ice Ageto be a great overview of Mammoth natural history and paleontology. The book has a nice combination of photos and text. It is a visually appealing book with decent text. It could be used as a coffee-table book, or read straight through as a book. It is very comprehensive, including sections on the evolution of Mammoths, lifestyles, and history of excavations.At times, I wasn't quite sure about the book's intended audience. The text seems a bit too advanced for kids, but too basic for readers familiar with Ice Age evolution. [[ASIN:0520261607 Mammoths: Giants of the Ice Age] seems best for lay readers or diehard Mammoth fans. In fact, I found the evolution and natural history sections great, but the other sections a bit dry. Fortunately, the book works pretty well if you skip around and read only those sections that interest you.Some reviewers have compared this to Paul Martin's [[ASIN:0520252438 Twilight of the Mammoths:: Ice Age Extinctions and the Rewilding of America (Organisms and Environments)]]. However, Martin's book focuses more on the Ice Age extinction rather than the natural history of Mammoths. If you want a focus on Mammoths,Mammoths: Giants of the Ice Ageis your book.This book is a revised version of an earlier book, and unlike many \\"revised\\" versions this book contains thorough revisions. It includes two full pages on Lyuba, the frozen baby Mammoth. I can't speak for every section of the book, but it does refer to recent discoveries."},{"Title":"Radio Astronomy & How to Build Your Own Telescope","review":"Don't get me wrong - I love this little book, but it is fairly old -unless you've got access to valves, the circuitry isn't of much use,and discussion of making antennae is limited, and mostly only to Yagi.but it does explain many concepts, ideas, give inspiration."}]`),S={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:A},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:W,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},L={class:"card-container"},C=["disabled"],H={key:0},G={key:1};function N(n,o,s,u,r,i){const c=g("PoemCard");return e(),t("section",null,[o[1]||(o[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),a("div",L,[(e(!0),t(f,null,w(i.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(e(),y(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(e(),t("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:o[0]||(o[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(e(),t("span",G,"Loading...")):(e(),t("span",H,"See more"))],8,C)):p("",!0)])}const x=d(S,[["render",N],["__scopeId","data-v-0f66759c"]]),M=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotes/15.md","filePath":"quotes/15.md"}'),O={name:"quotes/15.md"},B=Object.assign(O,{setup(n){return(o,s)=>(e(),t("div",null,[b(x)]))}});export{M as __pageData,B as default};
