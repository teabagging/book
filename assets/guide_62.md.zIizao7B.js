Comprehensive in its compilation, Balthus is a joy to own. Throughout the book's pages one discovers this brilliant artist's ingenious talent through text and images, and possibly discerns that he is himself seduced by ing&eacute;nue and adolescence. I believe Balthus captures this aspect intelligently, albeit somewhat seductively, but there are those who will not agree. There is humor and sadness too in his work. You see both in Balthus' first published work when Mitsou, a small book of drawings emerged. Mitsou was a kitten when found and later lost, that constantly appears as a full grown cat throughout Balthus' paintings. I believe the repetitive appearance of Mitsou illustrates the artist's emotional need for adolescent comfort that continued well beyond puberty. The author informs the reader of this in a very subtle way. Very definitely this is a book that delivers a broad introduction to Balthus where we are given more than a glimpse of his work in animated illustrations, study drawings, theatre set designs, portraits, landscapes, citiscapes, frescoes and still lifes. Furthermore, the author does provide a glance into the artist's interractions with his contemporaries but offers very little about Balthus' private life. I wonder if Balthus shrouded himself in mystery to parlay the truth of genius so often revealed in his paintings? Always distant, his life remains cloaked in contradictions. There are two versions of this book - French and English translation - I recommend them both."},{"Title":"Ne McColl","review":"I loved this book, the writer has such a wonderful way of making the past come alive.

Today, that apolitical version of Nietzsche is almost unthinkable, and Tracy Strong deserves a lion's share of the credit for that shift. If you're interested in any facet of Nietzsche's potential as a political thinker, this book is a must.Strong's greatest strength is his ability and willingness to read both the befores and afters that have produced the Nietzsche we thought we knew. He returns to Nietzsche's prized works, from the Greeks onward (with specific attention to Nietzsche's fave pre-Socratic thinkers) and re-evaluates Nietzsche's appropriations of them. Simultaneously, Strong always keeps in mind the various ways in which those who came AFTER Nietzsche have read and mis-read these moments. Such insights go a long way toward making a re-reading of Nietzsche as much about our changing reading agendas as they are about Nietzsche's.Strong also treats our past penchant for linking Nietzsche with darker politics, when we linked him with politics at all; the long-perceived relationship with fascism is given its airing here, but Strong convincingly prods the reader into regarding such strict alliances dubiously.The thoroughness of this book is also impressive. Strong covers everything, and covers it well. While he often carefully sets the context every time he cites Nietzsche, though, \\"Friedrich Nietzsche and the Politics of Transfiguration\\" is still guilty of falling into a trap that endangers every book I've read on him: the tendency to regard his thought as one organic whole, always present, rather than as progressive or even disjointed moments. Because of this, Strong often adduces comments from the much later Nietzsche in order to illuminate statements made earlier in Nietzsche's career. It is disingenuous, because it implies--in a way that can't be right--that what Nietzsche thought in the 1870s was also what he thought in the 1890s.The only other problem I have with Strong concerns some of the readings of more expressly literary texts. A background of political philosophy, with all of its emphases on explicit arguments and whether they bear scrutiny, reveals itself sometimes as a poor substitute for a more literary interest in what a text conceals as it reveals. As Strong revisits some of the more literary texts to which Nietzsche refers in \\"The Birth of Tragedy,\\" for example--namely Homer, Greek tragedians, etc.--he reads every passage as a lesson-conveying declaration; this is problematic for Nietzsche, who invested far more at that stage of his thought in anti-coherence than in rational argumentation and presentation.That aside, though, anyone interested in thinking about Nietzsche politically and in how Nietzsche can be thought of as political would do well to pick up a copy of Strong's book. It is clearly argued, well-written, and still provocative today."},{"Title":"The Israelis : Ordinary People in an Extraordinary Land","review":"This is an awesome and inspirational book, what more can I say?"},{"Title":"The Israelis : Ordinary People in an Extraordinary Land","review":"best book ever written about israeli society!based on personal experience, the book depicts issues exactly the way they are! from both sides.higly recommend to anyone visiting, making alyah(-immigrating) and to whoever wants to get to know the real israel."},{"Title":"The Israelis : Ordinary People in an Extraordinary Land","review":"A wonderful look into modern Israeli society today.

I also found it very broad in scope; it does not shy away from controversial issues, such as homosexuality, extreme ultra-orthodoxy, poverty, crime, politics, etc. This appears to be an overview of Israel as it really is in 2008 -- a real eye-opener. I would recommend it to Jews and non-Jews alike."},{"Title":"The Israelis : Ordinary People in an Extraordinary Land","review":"If you have any intrest in knowing what life is like in Israel this book will satify your intrest.

Of course this is only a glimpse but the book shows one there is such rich history and fascinating people in this diverse land. It gave some insight to both views mentioned in the editorial review.

The way it is written makes it very difficult to put down. Moreover, it sheds light on so much of Israeli society and culture that one could never know without going to Israel, knowing people who have gone, or knowing Israelis. I often find it is so difficult with the media to learn anything about Israel aside from the conflict (of course, this is very important and I do not mean to say it is not.) Anyway, I was thoroughly impressed by this book and I have suggested it to others as well!"},{"Title":"The Israelis : Ordinary People in an Extraordinary Land","review":"I remember this was the first book I read on Israeli society before going to Hebrew University in Jerusalem and I remember it being rather decent. That being said I decided to read it again after attending the university for over 2 years. The book has many good stories and tries to shield itself from political criticism by stating the book is not about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Needless to say she plugs in generic narrative every chance she gets. If this were done in interviews, or had any citations for this kind of stuff I would be talking about it very differently. She seems to have compiled good interviews and research about Israeli society but then just negated researching anything else and just relying on the words of the IDF and Israeli government whenever she hit a wall. This is annoying to go through a second time after being much more involved in the issue. If this is your 1st book on the subject, I would probably recommend it. If it is your not, there are much better books on the subject with much better research."},{"Title":"The Israelis : Ordinary People in an Extraordinary Land","review":"A light, breezy entertaining bit of pop-ethnology, fit to put on the shelf with such classics as Hedrick Smith's _The Russians_, Dusko Doder's _The Yugoslavs_, and Luigi Barzini's _The Italians_. Rosenthal interviewed an impressive cross-section of Israeli society, from all backgrounds and viewpoints. It's especially affecting to read the interviews with the young people, whether Jewish, Muslim, or Christian, with their too-soon exposure to war's ugliness and their simultaneous brave hopes for the future. Caution: many if not most of the interviewees are pseudonymous.It's a far-ranging book, with too many interesting foci to list completely: The decline of the collective ethic on Israel's kibbutzes. The insular nature of the ultra-Orthodox communities, and the painfully high human cost of leaving. The presence of ordinary vice and corruption, and how terrorists use the drug trade as a weapon of war. A potted history of Zionism, with many personal reminiscences of the 1948 war. Tours through the minority communities such as the Druze, the Bedouin, the Jews from Arab lands, and subcultures such as Russian prostitutes and gay Israelis.Welcome inclusions are factual takedowns of widespread lies such as the Jenin \\"massacre\\". But polemics are not the meat of the book, the people are. It is very good to finally have some voices to put with the faces of this remarkable people. Let one of the interviewees have the last word:\\"We're always in the headlines. _The New York Times_. CNN.The BBC. We get more coverage than India. Than China. Than the entire continent of Africa. There's so much news about us, you'd think we're also a billion people, not six million. We're all the time on TV and front pages, so people think they know us. Unsmiling soldiers. Screaming settlers. Crying mourners. Bearded guys in black hats. Well, Israelis are much more than those photos. We complain about our teachers. Worry about exams. Flirt at parties. Wonder if we look good in our bathing suits. We curse at traffic jams and cut in line at the movies. We've got normal fears and dreams. Like young people everywhere, we want to find love and be loved. We're just normal people trying to live in this abnormal, tiny, beautiful country.\\""},{"Title":"The Israelis : Ordinary People in an Extraordinary Land","review":"I teach a course on the middle east at the University. After reading this book, I realized that very few of us so called \\"experts\\" actually know abiut the State of Israel in depth. Many of my colleagues including myself really have no advanced knowledge about Israel even though we claim to be \\"knowledgeable\\" about the issues. This book opened up eyes and my head to an Israel that you don't hear about in the media. the book goes in depth to describe Israelis of every religon, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation and class. It also describes the lives of the average Israeli, which is absent in all media outlets. I have decided to assign this book as required reading for the class I will be teaching about the Middle East in the coming spring semester."},{"Title":"The Israelis : Ordinary People in an Extraordinary Land","review":"This is a very well written book about Israel. It consists of plenty of anecdotal information about a wide variety of aspects of Israeli life.We see young adults, the army, and entrepreneurs. We see divisions among Jews into Ashkenazim, Mizrahim, Russians, Africans, Haredim, Orthodox, and Non-Orthodox. And we see the internal and external worries and problems they have. More than that, we see their reaction to \\"the situation,\\" namely the war of annihilation being fought by extremist Arabs against the Jews of the region.Perhaps the most interesting part of the book is the description of non-Jewish Israelis: the Muslims, Bedouin, Druze, and Christians. I was amazed by the tolerance shown by the Israeli public for outright disloyalty to Israel in time of war shown by many non-Jews. I can't imagine acting so against a nation I happened to be visiting, let alone one I lived in and might even be a citizen of. These sections convinced me that there won't be any peace in the region for a long time.One item I can't agree with is the subtitle: ordinary people in an extraordinary land. In fact, while the people are much the same as people everywhere, the land is also much the same as land everywhere. Israel is, after all, a small country that looms much larger than life due to the enormous amount of ink that is spent on it. Still, given some of the more outrageous things we sometimes see written about Israel and Israeli society from Israel's detractors, this book is a very refreshing change indeed."},{"Title":"The Israelis : Ordinary People in an Extraordinary Land","review":"The Israelis tells the undistorted truth about the rich ethnic, cultural, etc. heritage of the Israeli people.

With the recent events in and around the country (the Hamas election victory, Ariel Sharon's new political party, his incapacitation) I decided to read it again. I started by looking up a few facts for a discussion group, and became so involved that I read the book a second time from cover to cover. I've discussed the book with friends from Israel, and all but one of them feel that it is an accurate view of modern life. The one person who didn't agree said it was \\"skewed,\\" with not enough weight given to the various Orthodox communities and beliefs (she is Orthodox). The impression I had of her comments, though, were that she wasn't unhappy with the boook per se, but rather with the current path being taken by Israelis, and that this boook is promoting this path. My feeling was that it wasn't promoting, just reporting it as accurately as possible.If you plan to take a trip to Israel, read this book first. You'll enjoy your trip much more than you expected."},{"Title":"The Israelis : Ordinary People in an Extraordinary Land","review":"As a professor of History, Political Science and Comparative Cultures for the past 25 years, I strongly recommend that ALL instructors incorporate this book in their courses on the Middle East.

In fact, more than half said it was the best book they've read in years! This book is extremely well written, factual, funny, and a fast read. FYI - The Department Heads of our Political Science and History Departments are recommending that their colleagues incorporate this book in their classrooms!"},{"Title":"The Israelis : Ordinary People in an Extraordinary Land","review":"This is perhaps the best book ever written on exploring the ordinary lives of Israelis,and the way they live now. It explores in great details the lives of a wide variety of Israelis, and gives much inside information on the society. It gives very sympathetic and understanding portraits of the victims of terror. And it shows a basic understanding of the complex social reality of Israel.It does however it seem to fall short in its ultimate political judgment and wisdom, with its endorsement of a two- state solution that might be disastrous for Israel. .It is also perhaps not completely fair and understanding of the Jewish religious public in Israel.Nonetheless there is no other book I can think of which puts the reader more directly in contact with so many different Israelis from so many different walks of life. And it thus presents something of the complexity of Israeli life which is ordinarily absent in cliche and cardboard presentations of it in the mass media."},{"Title":"The Israelis : Ordinary People in an Extraordinary Land","review":"This is probably one of the best books that I have ever read on the people of Israel! I couldn't put it down. I found that the honesty and realness of the people was astounding. I reccommend it to anyone and everyone who wants to understand the Israeli people."},{"Title":"The Israelis : Ordinary People in an Extraordinary Land","review":"Rosenthal does a stupendous job of illuminating the shadowy corners, bright spots and internal conflicts of this tiny country filled with Jews from all over the world, with little in common but a beleaguered history of persecution.With a lively and well-organized mixture of reporting, history and interviews, Rosenthal brings cultures and neighborhoods to life. She begins with the violence - a bus blown up by a suicide bomber, then follows the tentacles of conflict into everyday life. It's the violence that fuels the youth culture of work hard, play hard, and fosters a cross-cultural, patriotic military solidarity that cuts through religious and political differences.While the first section concentrates on what Israelis share, the second divides them into groups. The European Ashkenazi, educated, dominant, and often secular, arouse resentment in the middle-Eastern Mizrahi who are more religious, more conservative and poorer. Then there are the Russians, hordes of them, mostly secular, and many not even Jewish (only one Jewish grandparent is required for immigration). And strangest of all, the Ethiopians, wholly isolated and heroically rescued, many of whom never saw electricity until emigration.The third section explores religious differences: the anti-Zionist Haredim who, ironically, absorb the most from the welfare state with their large families and non-working, scholarly fathers; the Orthodox, who make up the bulk of the settlers in the occupied territories, and write the rules for marriage and divorce, and the Non-Orthodox who make up 80 percent of the population. Then there are the non-Jews: the Muslims, Christians, Druze and Bedouin.And finally there's the sexual revolution - marriage and divorce, homosexuality, prostitution.Rosenthal lets individual voices emerge from the clamor and cacaphony to plead their way of life with fervor, hope, defiance and sometimes bewilderment. Her reportage and history blend seamlessly with the interviews to provide context. This is a masterful portrait of a country built on a commonality, but rife with contradictions. It'll make you wonder what will happen if peace ever comes. A fascinating read about a tiny, beseiged country, populated by the whole wide world."},{"Title":"The Israelis : Ordinary People in an Extraordinary Land","review":"To be honest, I picked up this book and started to read it simply out of boredom, but it turned out to greatly exceed my expectations. As an Israeli myself, I can truthfully say this book very accurately describes what life in Israel is like today - definitely not what we all see on television.There are so many different cultures, beliefs, and ideas within Israel itself, and Donna Rosenthal did an excellent job portraying many of those lifestyles: the secular, the religious, the Christian, the Druze, etc. Her book does give the reader a pretty clear and truthful picture of the situation in the country.Each of the stories she chose to write about were also quite interesting. The book was pretty much a page-turner for me. Even though I probably knew most of these things, as I've lived them myself, it was still a great read, and I'd recommend it to anyone who wishes to get the true image of Israel, not what we see on the news every day.All the stories were very clear and straight to the point. The ending chapter is dedicated to how it is possible to live together, after all, which I believe is very important.Even though this book is quite a light read, I trust you'll still get a lot out of it!"},{"Title":"The Israelis : Ordinary People in an Extraordinary Land","review":"An example of a nick, when the author spoke about the Pizzeria's in the Hareidi neighborhoods, she refered to them as &#34;glatt&#34;, now as long as the pizzeria is kosher for Hareidi standards, &#34;glatt&#34; wouldn't have any part of a pizzeria as the term refers to any meat product that was slaughtered properly according to Orthodox Jewish laws!Anyway Donna pretty much has it all setup in a nutshell. Well written!"},{"Title":"The Israelis : Ordinary People in an Extraordinary Land","review":"I found this book (the first edition, 2003) in an apartment I'm renting in Jerusalem. It's quite interesting and well-written.However, the author seems to have been rather sloppy in her research. I noticed at least two gross factual inaccuracies in details about the Orthodox communities in chapter 9, and this in turn calls into question whether the other information in the book is supported by the facts.On page 176 (2003 edition), Rosenthal describes how \\"[s]oon after independence, Prime Minister Ben-Gurion agreed to Rabbi [E.M.] Schach's and other rabbis' requests to free haredi scholars of military obligation.\\" Ben-Gurion's primary interlocutor on this issue was actually Rabbi A.Y. Karelitz (known as the Hazon Ish), the leading Lithuanian haredi rabbi of his day in Israel; the story of their meeting is quite well known in haredi circles, even to school-age children.Again on page 188 (2003 edition), she writes: \\"For Lubavitch/Habad Hasidim, however, [Israel] Independence Day is a religious holiday becase they believe the birth of Israel in 1948 marked the beginning of the messianic redemption.\\" This is completely incorrect: there are indeed religious Zionist Jews who believe this, and their communities are treated in the following chapter of the book; but Habad's position has never been that the establishment of the State has anything to do with the coming of the Messiah. Habad does support Jewish settlement on all territory under Israeli control, and opposes giveaways of land, for religious reasons having to do with saving Jewish lives; sometimes this puts them side-by-side with various Religious Zionist groups, as in opposition to the Gaza disengagement of 2005. Most likely our author saw or heard of such events and jumped to conclusions that the Habad and Religious Zionist ideologies are the same. But again, how hard would it have been to find out the real facts?"},{"Title":"The Israelis : Ordinary People in an Extraordinary Land","review":"This book reflects a reality in Israel to which you - the reader - are an unsuspecting party: a battle for the soul of Israel between religious and secular, conservatives and liberals, friends and enemies of the state. From my perspective - a recent Oleh in Jerusalem - this book could not be more skewed to the political and social left. In every chapter, assuming there is potential, the author finds a way to skewer observant Jews, accusing them of everything from warped sexuality to outright racism. One example is an account of the Shas Party's anti-Russian campaign, presenting them as an expression of religious Jewish Israels..... without ever explaining that the Shas party is the expression primarily of very religious Mizrahi Jews and does not even remotely appeal to the greater Orthodox community. Statistics are also highly inaccurate: bandied about is this strange statistic that 500,000 Russian Olim are non-Jewish, when in reality it is closer to 330,000 and includes those who consider themselves Jews but do not meet the halakhic definition of such. Russian immigration has plummeted, recently, from 100,000 per year during the nineties to something like 3,500 per year, now. The author is pitching one more stone in the camp of pluralistic, pro-Palestinian liberal Israelis, hoping that you'll join in the quest to remould Israel in the cast of liberal American wishes. Do yourself a favor: don't bother with this one."},{"Title":"The Israelis : Ordinary People in an Extraordinary Land","review":"For all practical purposes, this book is fantastic. It is generally fair, diverse, and interesting. However, I wish to use this space for what many will call a rant: a defense for the &quot;ultra-Orthodox&quot;, or the Charedim.Being somewhat in between a Modern and Ultra-Orthodox Jew, I tend to disagree with their portrayal in this book. The main problems are as follows:1. The chapter on them in the book, instead of asserting identity, is about all the Charedim that &quot;betray&quot; their way of life, in a sympathetic light. Donna has this theme of Charedi incompetence running occasionally through the book.2. Using the word &quot;lewd&quot; instead of &quot;immoral&quot; or an equivalent is just ASKING for the implication that the Torah is &quot;archaic&quot;, another unfair term she uses, when she could say &quot;ancient&quot; instead.3. To ignore that the Charedim are on the front line of the war on Arab demographics, mantain thwe lowest crime and affir problems, and hold to high ethic standards is nearly as bad as not at least trying to sympathize with an idea of Divene intervention in wars.4. The Rabbinate control marriage and divorce in Israel so that we could avoid huge problems associated with moral decay, like intermarriage, affaris, and children who are eternally seperated from their people by law. To mock this with sympathetic portrayals of men who illegally stick M16s in rabbis' faces isn't fair.In short, I think this is just not balanced, in some degree, but is a fantastic book."},{"Title":"The Israelis : Ordinary People in an Extraordinary Land","review":"This new 2008 edition is a wonderful gift for readers of different religions, political backgrounds and ages.I was born and raised in Baghdad, Iraq. As soon as I started reading The Israelis, I simply could not put it down. I learned about many varied faces of Israelis. The clear and easy prose and style of writing, the historical and political facts, the colorful anecdotes are enthralling and captivating. The book made me think and rethink about different issues that are an integral part of daily life in Israel -- and by extension throughout the Arab world.It's packed full of information about different types of Arabic speaking Israelis -- Israeli Muslims, Christians and Druze. I learned a lot about their relationships within their communities and with other Israelis and Arabs outside Israel. Ms. Rosenthal does an excellent job elucidating issues that can change Arab thinking about Israel.I highly recommend this 2008 edition of The Israelis for anyone interested in Israel, and also for anyone interested in grasping a better understanding of Arab society and its relationship to Israelis.Layla Murad"},{"Title":"The Israelis : Ordinary People in an Extraordinary Land","review":"If you are looking to learn about the real mix if people that we call the Israelis this is the book to read.

After reading this book, I can only take my hat off to all of the people in that country that are making it work. Ms. Rosenthal's work is so thorough and yet so interesting to read. I feel better after reading this book that the people living in Israel today will be able to withstand all of the forces that are against them in the troubled world today."},{"Title":"The Israelis : Ordinary People in an Extraordinary Land","review":"This vibrant & colorful work on the diverse society of Israel incorporates interviews with a large number of individuals, insightful observations, facts of history and the constantly changing figures & statistics of the dynamic little country. This second updated edition covers the start of the new millennium, bringing the story up to date. Rosenthal deftly integrates the personal opinions of hundreds of individuals with the latest developments in a rapidly evolving society for a most intriguing portrait of themiracle nationat the centre of the earth, a country of more than 7 million people of different geographical, cultural & religious backgrounds. She avoids politics as much as possible which is a definite advantage.Israel is a tiny sliver of decency where the rule of law applies, in a vast neighborhood of oppression stretching from the Atlas Mountains to the Arabian Sea and the Arctic Ocean. Its free media, its buoyant - sometimes even tumultuous - democratic process and its freedom of religion set it apart from the rest of the Middle East, from North Africa as well asRussiaand the states of Central Asia. It manages to maintain this respect for life despite continuousbelligerencefrom its Middle Eastern neighbors, threats of divestment, opprobrium from organizations like theUnited Abominationsand an onslaught of homicide-suicide bombings, the results of which are documented inLife in the Shadow of Terrorby Nechemia Coopersmith.Rosenthal's writing style is enthralling and very honest, as she deals with dating, family attitudes to various issues, relations between the sexes, relationships across religious & ethnic divides and the role of the IDF in bringing people together. In this section, my ears were perking up every 3rd paragraph or so, admittedly for anything but pious reasons. Her examination of the IDF, a formidable fighting force, illuminates and entertains in an amusing manner as does her analysis of the country's impressive technological innovation, an issue more thoroughly covered inIsrael in the World: Changing Lives Through Innovationby Helen & Douglas Davis.The book recounts several dramatic instances of the ingathering such as those of the Beta Israel from Ethiopia and the massive influx of Russians after the collapse of the Soviet Union, a valuable gain of skills in fields ranging from medicine to technology and culture. Regarding the Beta Israel, I highly recommendOperation Solomonby Stephen Spector, a book that recounts this tale of suspense in riveting detail. Rosenthal explains the difference between Ashkenazim, Sephardim & Mizrahim, Haredim, Orthodox and Secular as well as the diverse Arab and Christian communities. About 50% of Israeli Jews are descendents of refugees from North African & Middle Eastern states who fled or were expelled after the rebirth of the nation in 1948. Israel is the only country in the Middle East whereChristian numbersare growing and Arab Christians are amongst the most wealthy & educated of citizens. Chapters are devoted to the Druze, the Muslim communities and the nomadic Bedouin who find themselves in a particularly interesting phase between tradition & modernity.The final section deals with marriage, polygamy, adultery, divorce, sexual preferences and the use of substances. Considering the existential threats the country faces, especially from Hezbollah & Iran, and the psychological scars inflicted by two millennia ofantisemitism, the negatives are not as severe as in other societies. One cannot but regret the occurrence of adultery, divorce and prostitution but even this part holds the reader's attention without depressing too much. Even in the sadness of these vices, a certain love of life shines through that is more affirmative than melancholy. However much those of us who love Israel would like to see less of this sort of thing, I think only Mashiach will ultimately solve these problems in wisdom & mercy.The different communities comprising the nation of Israel might seem divisive on the surface but when assessed as a whole, thoroughly contemplated & digested, the words of all these individuals obliquely affirm an underlying unity in all the bewildering diversity. In other words, all the contributing cultural elements really serve to strengthen the soul of the nation. One highly admirable fact not discussed at length is Israel's embrace of Sudanese refugees from Darfur; while the world, the NGO's and the UN are babbling on without doing anything, Zion is extending mercy to those who by the grace of the Almighty manage to reach it. G-d bless Israel. This inspiring & uplifting book concludes with an epilogue, notes, bibliography and index."},{"Title":"The Israelis : Ordinary People in an Extraordinary Land","review":"The author put quite a bit of work into writing \\"The Israelis\\" - and it shows. This book is especially useful for anyone truly interested in challenging their perceptions built up through a lifetime of mainstream media coverage of Israel.I read most of the book on a flight to Israel. I found the information immediately useful in better understanding that complex society then finished it on my flight back.In the amazing timing category, I had just read the chapter on Israel's ultra-Orthodox and their belief that Israel should not have been founded as a secular state (believing that only Messiah should do so) when I was amazed to see a TV news report showing four ultra-orthodox Jews standing next to Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad at his Holocaust denial conference. Some of the ultra-Orthodox community believes the Holocaust happened as God's punishment to the Jews for not being religious enough. It seems inconsistent to, on one hand participate in a Holocaust denial conference, and on the other believe that the Holocaust was somehow God's punishment, but there they were in Teheran. If it were not for having just read \\"The Israelis\\" I would have had no idea why.I highly recommend this book for anyone wishing to better understand Israel.Reviewer: Chuck DeVore is Vice President of Communications and a senior fellow for fiscal policy at the Texas Public Policy Foundation.

Rosenthal opens with a somber look at \\"The Situation,\\" and the resulting fear that Israelis have had to face in the Second Intifada with unpredictible bus and cafe bombings.Based on interviews with everyday Israelis throughout the book, Rosenthal then continues to reveal a different, interesting and fun side of Israel beyond the headlines, from dating Israeli style to military service to the high-tech phenomenon that is defining Israel as an nascent economic powerhouse. Did you know that Firewall, instant messaging, and the camera pill were all invented by Israelis?She then takes us on a journey into the very heart of Israel: the Jews themselves. We see the tensions between the ultra-orthodox and secular Jews, the incredible story of the Ethiopian Jews' rescue and migration to the Holy Land, as well as the problem of Russian immigration.She then exposes the reality of life of the \\"Israeli Arabs,\\" who are considered to have the best quality of life than any of their Arab counterparts in Arab, nations but yet suffer from discrimination, even though they can serve public office and have all the rights of any Israeli. We also learn about the intriguing lives of the Druze, Bedouin, and the Christians in the Jewish State.Several interesting and heart-felt stories show up through out the book. At once we see a Palestinian who shows up on an Israeli-Jew's doorstep one day...it was his home before the 1948 War...and another time we see a happy wedding occasion shattered due to a Palestinian terrorist attack. But tragedy is counterbalanced with humor when Rosenthal tells us stories such as the ironic one about the Muslim who holds the key to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre because the different Christian denominations cannot get along.Through her many interactions with the variety of Israelis she meets, Rosenthal successfully and poignantly humanizes all sides -- Arab, Jew, Christian, Druze -- including the Israeli soldier who feels the pain of of the Palestinian family whose crops he is ordered to demolish.Finally, she takes us into the less attractive life of Israel: divorce, adultery, drugs, and prostitution.Overall, Rosenthal shows us that Israel is a beautiful place with many cultures trying their hardest to coexist. In some cases, she shows us that Israel has a lot to be desired, but the good and beauty that is Israel overshadows the ugliness that is the conflict, if only Israel would be given the chance.She paints a colorful portrait of Israel that will change minds about Israel and its conflict. This is not a book about the Palestinians, as Rosenthal notes, for they deserve their own book. Through hundreds of heart-felt stories, her goal is to shed new light on Israel, its culture and politics, and convince people to view Israel in a way that they never have before.Rosenthal is compassionate, unbiased, and very informative throughout. Definitely recommended reading for those interested in the Middle East and contemporary events."},{"Title":"The Israelis : Ordinary People in an Extraordinary Land","review":"I should have read this book before traveling to Israel. Donna Rosenthal is a skilled writer and her antecdotes are often hilarious. Read \\"From Beirut to Jerusalem\\" for the politics and the views of the leaders, but read \\"The Israelis\\" to understand the opinions of everyday Israelis and to get a glimpse of what to expect when you're actually there. It's well worth a read."},{"Title":"The Israelis : Ordinary People in an Extraordinary Land","review":"I advise everyone to read this book before coming to conclusions concerning the people of Israel. There is much to learn."},{"Title":"The Israelis : Ordinary People in an Extraordinary Land","review":"Very well written and enjoyable to read. Information about every day life in Israel was interesting. Particularly enjoyed learning about the history of the Ethiopian Jews and how they were brought to Israel, as well as about all of the different groups of Jews and how they interact. Good overview of present day life in Israel."},{"Title":"The Israelis : Ordinary People in an Extraordinary Land","review":"Since buying this book, i have recommended it to virtually everyone I know.It is outstanding and should be read by anyone and everyone who has any interest in the Middle East."},{"Title":"The Israelis : Ordinary People in an Extraordinary Land","review":"The Israelis is the best book on Israel I have ever read. It does not sugar coat any aspect of the current situation and is honest in its evaluation of the participants. Rosenthal does an excellent job of giving the reader a taste of the \\"real Israel\\", one that they don't see on a two-week tour of the country. I have spent a lot of time in Israel and this book taught me more about the people than ever before. I recommend this book with extremly high regard; it is an extremely easy read and is dense in content. I feel like I personally know a new handful of Israelis after reading this book."},{"Title":"The Israelis : Ordinary People in an Extraordinary Land","review":"The headlines last October told only the tip of the story - 19 Israelis murdered in a horrific suicide bombing at a Haifa beachfront restaurant. Reading the story one learns that the Maxim restaurant was a symbol of coexistence in Haifa. The victims of the attack were Jews and Christians, kibbutzniks and city residents. Previous attacks have targeted Haredi ultra-Orthodox Jews; Muslim students and waiters have been among the victims as well.Digging deeper into the victims' stories one realizes that despite differences in religion, culture and belief, they are all connected to the fate of the State of Israel. Orthodox and secular Jews; Ashkenazim and Mizrahim; Christians, Muslims and Druze; Russian and Ethiopian immigrants - each sector of Israeli society has played a part in the tragic events of the three years of violence.From the outside, readers and viewers may be confused when they try to understand exactly who the Israeli people are. On the holy streets of Jerusalem and the bohemian alleyways of Tel Aviv, visitors see Jews who look like Arabs, Arabs who look like Jews. But who is the real Israeli, who dares to live a normal life in a country that, because of current events, is anything but normal?Donna Rosenthal's \\"The Israelis: Ordinary People in an Extraordinary Land\\" (Free Press, October 2003), introduces us to the real Israel, the Israel nobody knows. This is the Israel behind the news headlines, the stories of ordinary people in an extraordinary land.\\"The Israelis\\" reads like an extended feature article, as the author allows the men and women she interviewed to relate their own stories. The voices and viewpoints are alternately despairing and hopeful, defiant and conciliatory. No one is left out - the settlers, the Bedouin, Israel's gay minority - all have a voice. The total picture presented in this book is that of Israel itself, a varied, diverse, changing, evolving society that is much more than headlines.The book relates the stories of Israeli soldiers, who defend a country that has always been in a state of war. The book covers the hope offered by Israeli technology and entrepreneurship, as well as the problems of the country's illegal trade in women. Nothing is left out - the positive and negative aspects of Israeli society all play a part of this comprehensive picture.The people who tell their stories in \\"The Israelis\\" are very real. The author tells the story of the Muslim who holds the keys to the Holy Sepulcher Church in Jerusalem, as well as that of the founding fathers of the Alon Shvut settlement in Gush Etzion. Here, too, are the stories of traditional Israelis originally from Morocco who believe in miracles and vote for Shas, as well as those of secular Israelis who order Big Macs in the language of the Ten Commandments.The book makes an emotional mark when it relates the story of the clandestine human airlift that brought 14,000 Ethiopians out of Africa in thirty-six hours. This is balanced with the tale of the immigrant avalanche from the countries of the former Soviet Union, some of whom are not even Jewish, but who have contributed greatly to the country as well.If this book has a fault it's in its attempt to tell everything, to be a total picture of Israeli society and how it got to where it is today. How can a book deal with the ongoing Intifada without mentioning the horrific terror attack on Muslim worshippers perpetrated by Dr. Baruch Goldstein in Hebron in 1994? How can a study of Israelis today deal with kibbutzniks without relating to illegal immigration during the British mandate? Every element of Israel's past does play a significant part in the country's attempt to get beyond its vast security-related and social problems and provide a better future for its citizens.\\"The Israelis\\" is lively, irreverent, intimate and always fascinating. With its interweaving of hundreds of personal stories with historical facts, \\"The Israelis\\" is one of the most original books about Israel in decades."},{"Title":"The Israelis : Ordinary People in an Extraordinary Land","review":"Donna Rosenthal hooks the reader from page one.

Before forming opinions about Israeli, learn about all types of Israelis from the stories of their lives that they tell here. The book is an easy read, you can open to any chapter or hop around. I found more humor, down to earth human interest and truth in the reporter's writing that gave me a deeper insight into the people of Israel (Moslem, Christian, Jew,Druze, European, Asian, African,Western, Orthodox, Reform, Agnostic, illiterate,scientist, etc.)than I could find anywhere including trips to Israel. In my opinion, this book of reality and hope is a must read for all people, regardless of their religion, nationality, race or political bent.The diversity of Israel's people is greater than anywhere in the world."},{"Title":"The Israelis : Ordinary People in an Extraordinary Land","review":"My Israeli tour guide was reading this book -- said he couldn't put it down. It's fascinating, balanced, with amazing insights on all kinds of modern Israelis. He was right. I laughed, I cried and learned an enormous amount. lt's great for tourists, students, professors, Christians, Jews and Muslims, tour guides -- anyone who really wants to understand Israelis though their own words, not superficial news reports.Religious and athiest, left-wing, right-wing, Jew and Arab -- every Israel I met who has read this book says it is really accurate. It should be in newsrooms, classrooms and libraries."},{"Title":"The Israelis : Ordinary People in an Extraordinary Land","review":"I am American and have visited Israel 15 times in the last 20 years. I read as much as I can about the country, and Rosenthal's book __The Israelis__ is the best source I've come across for the information I care about: the people. Rosenthal writes in an engaging and personal way. There are plenty of facts and figures in __The Israelis__, but the writing is never dry. She introduces us to real and very interesting people to emphasize her observations, and she conveys a deep and accurate familiarity with various segments of Israeli society. This book is a good antidote to the stereotyping of Israelis that we usually read in the media. Highly highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Israelis : Ordinary People in an Extraordinary Land","review":"What a lovely book! On returning from my first trip to Israel not long ago, friends and colleagues were stunned at how totally I -- a liberal secular non-Jew -- had fallen for Israel, and especially for the Israeli people. No doubt I sounded goofily infatuated trying to explain the resilience, toughness, crusty directness, the kindness, the wit, the incredible Israeli smile -- see, there I go again.Well, they're each getting this book for the next birthday, because Donna Rosenthal so entertainingly illustrates and elaborates all that I was trying to get across, and more. She shines a gentle but penetrating light on the contemporary Israeli culture and people from inside out.This is a wonderfully written book, intricately but smoothly woven from anecdotes, interviews, vignettes, histories, and possible futures; it is a pleasure to read. Most highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Israelis : Ordinary People in an Extraordinary Land","review":"Upon returning back to the states after my second trip to Israel I was completely captivated once again by the breath taking beauty of the country.

The stories reminded me of the things to avoid for the things that will come. A Moorish Empire will rise again.Irving starts with his personal journey then he has several stories of gallant and modest characters which makes you feel your in the garden or the palace. It brings back what love was and how it should be. I really like the story of the Father striving to keep his son from learning about love. I know no matter what you do you can never lock love away because of its power and its vast estate one would have to know it is impossible. This is a worth while reader for anyone who knows and wants the best from humanity for it is the Moors who created civilization and it is their station to restore it."},{"Title":"Tales of the Alhambra","review":"&quot;Tales of the Alhambra&quot; was penned by American author Washington Irving (&quot;Rip Van Winkle,&quot; &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot;) during a stay at the legendary Alhambra in Granada, Spain. I bought this book after my visit to the Alhambra, and found it to be a fantastic companion to what I had seen and experienced.The Alhambra (and Generalife) is a combination fort/palace/gardens dating from the 13th century, filled with fantastic Arabic architecture (ornate plasterwork, ceramic tiles, sculpted marble fountains and archways), and lots of room for imagining the days of its former greatness, which Irving brings to life most memorably. The book is illustrated with charming and detailed watercolour engravings dating from the same period when the book was written.Irving seamlessly winds legend, history, and a Spanish travelogue of sorts together, and even though the book is over 170 years old, it seems as if it was written yesterday. There are tales of princes, genies, lost and found loves, enchanted treasures, battles, hellish headless horses (does the inspiration seem familiar?), and commentary on the Spanish landscape and nature of the Spaniards that he lives with. Full of bewitching music, the smell of roses and exotic perfumes, firey sunsets, and the ghosts of the past, the book is a sensory treat as well. If you plan on visiting the Alhambra, read this first--it will definitely enhance your experience. If you've already visited, this makes a priceless souvenir, bringing to life once more the stately halls and fragrant gardens."},{"Title":"Tales of the Alhambra","review":"I visited Spain in Nov 2002 and was absolutely enchanted by the Nasrid Alhambra palace in Granada. Built in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada mountains, it casts a watchful eye over the inhabitants of the city below.From the exterior, palace is surrounded by an imposing fort structure built of reddish brown stone - clearly meant to give the vision of martial strength to the outsiders. At night from the Albaycin (Old Arab Quarter), the palace is hauntingly beautiful-floodlights on the fort giving it a ghostly appearance. Upon entering the deceptively unassuming palace, a world of breathtakingly beautiful art and architecture slowly overwhelms you.I simply couldn't get enough of this palace and often found myself trying to absorb as much of it's ambiance as possible. I was introduced to Washington Irving's work when I had bought an audioguide at the entrance of the palace. This guide was essentially oral excerpts from his book detailing the history and legends of each room as I walked through them.Upon completing the tour, I then was compelled to buy the book. Reading it, I could see the Alhambra in front of my eyes again. In addition to that, I could imagine its former royal inhabitants as the legends of chivalry, romance and ghosts were told.Washington Irving had the opportunity to live for several months in the Alhambra palace. Back then it was a forgotten Moorish fort in a terrible state of disrepair. His style is very soft and dreamlike, thus one is drawn into his writing as he discovers the legends from the 'guardians' who have taken residence in the palace.This book was truly a delight to read, I highly recommend it to anyone wanting to learn about the Alhambra or as a memoir of one's own visit to the palace."},{"Title":"Tales of the Alhambra","review":"Washington Irving is credited with bringing the glorious history and unbelievable beauty of the Alhambra, in the city of Granada, (the last stronghold of the Moors in the South of Spain) to Western conciousness.After spending a day at the Alhambra last Summer, and passing by the closed apartments that he occupied, I decided to listen to his book while driving one hour each way to work. (any short trips won't work because all of the 'tales' are lengthy)My title says it all. If you are a student of dry history this book is not for you. Only about 20-30 minutes will satisfy your curiosity for the facts. If you enjoy legend and lore this book is it. The bulk of the book tells numerous stories of princes and princeses, kings and soldiers, common laborers such as mule drivers and water carriers, loves found and loves lost, and especially the perrenial human lust for long lost and buried treasure, etc., all told with a wonderous style and feel for southern Spain of the 13-th to 15-th centuries.The factual account of how Columbus finally came to agreement with Isabella and Ferdinand to sign the contract for the three ships, almost by chance in 1492, while the two sovereigns were outside Granada laying the final siege of the Alhambra fortress, is mind blowing. History came 'that close' to having Columbus sail three French ships instead of the Nina, the Pinta and the Santa Maria.If you want just the facts, look elsewhere. But if you are planning a trip to Granada and the Alhambra, definitely pick up this book, along with a second, more fact based, and give a read or listen. I wish I had done that before my trip. It would have given much more life and enjoyment to the place as I walked through the various rooms and towers and gardens that Irving so lovingly describes."},{"Title":"Tales of the Alhambra","review":"Washington Irving's \\"Tales of the Alhambra\\" is really two books in one. The first section chronicles Irvings 1829 visit to the crumbling Alhambra Palace in Granada, Spain. Irving was permitted to reside within the palace grounds. His beautifully detailled descriptions of the deteriorating palace and its inhabitants fit well within the romantic vision that was beginning to sweep Europe. One can only imagine Irving's influence in shaping the Orientalist craze that played out in the Nineteenth Century European art.As a young man, Washington Iriving was inspired to learn Spanish after having read Miguel Cervantes' \\"Don Quixote\\". In that work, Cervantes interjected long romantic tales into the middle of the narrative. The second half of \\"Tales of the Alhambra\\" is a collection of romantic tales inspired by the Alhambra's Moorish and Spanish past. They are charming tales clearly inspired by Miguel Cervantes.\\"Tales of the Alhambra\\" was published in 1832 and has been in continous print. This book survives because of Irving's ability to recreate a beautiful and romantic past for the ever elegant Alhambra Palace."},{"Title":"Tales of the Alhambra","review":"On returning from Spain this spring with fresh memories of The Alhambra of Grenada, I downloaded Washington Irving's work. I wish I had read it before visiting The Alhambra. In these not so dusty pages one views the political and social background of The Alhambra, and hence, all of Spain. The halls, terraces, fountains are richly discussed in this work, mixed in with the Ghostly visions and stories there associated that Irving relates. The stories alone are as fresh as modern television, rich fodder for the imagination.He also describes Spain as it was in the early 19th century, allowing the traveler to compares his own sojourn there.Well worth the reading."},{"Title":"Tales of the Alhambra","review":"Many Americans know Washington Irving as the author of \\"the Legend of Sleepy Hollow\\" and \\"Rip Van Winkle\\". Few realize that he was also a world traveler, scholarly fluent in Arabic and Spanish and something of an Hispanophile, to the say least.Irving's book is largely responsible for the widespread romantic image of Spain. It is a collection of observation, history, fairy tale, written in Irving's unique blend of romanticism and healthy skepticism. It is roughly framed by his journey to the Alhambra and his departure from it, an in between we are given a tour of the grounds and hear a few tales (including tales of Moorish ghosts on headless horses) which are roughly intertwined as in the Arabian Nights. Indeed, this little book is the 'Arabian Nights' of the west.Before visit the Alhambra read this book. If you are not planning on going, read it and you'll probably change your mind."},{"Title":"Tales of the Alhambra","review":"This wonderful book written by a well-loved American author details his travels in Spain, and more specifically in the Castle Alhambra. These tales are delightful, and seemlessly weave from fact to fiction to history to folklore. It is a true travel log, done oh so many years ago, and done with Irving's whimcical and enchanting style. The sketches give a good description of Spain and travel in the early 1800's. Older children and adolescents would probably enjoy these sketches."},{"Title":"Tales of the Alhambra","review":"Most likely you know the famous Washington Irving books. But this is left out of most school's must read lists. The Alhambra is a great gift of the Moors to Spain - they ruled there for almost 900 years. Irving, along with Russia's ambassador visited and stayed on. So the tales come from being there. Unusual for a gringo."},{"Title":"Tales of the Alhambra","review":"This book is out of print, our local stores couldn't get it for us. An antique dealer on Amazon shipped it to us and within the week we where lost in Granada, Spain, with Washington Irving. We will visit the Alhambra shortly and will think fondly of this book, which gave us quite an insight to its history. There is a good progression to the short stories that make up the book, all of which revolve around the Alhambra. I truly enjoyed reading this one."},{"Title":"Tales of the Alhambra","review":"We returned from a visit to the Alhambra in March. The audioguide there consists largely of excerpts from Irving's book, read in a soft soothing voice. This book - and its illustrations - perfectly capture the Alhambra in Irving's time: both its tranquility in this space elevated above the city and its romantic and glorious past. The book reflects the aura of the place and Irving's captivation with its history; it is just right in size, font, and white space, a total publishing success."},{"Title":"The good soldier Schweik (Penguin Books)","review":"The idea,the dialogs..everything here are clever and original...Hasek gives us a funny hero who you don't know if he is stupid or pretends the stupid in the chaotic disorganised Austrian army.The book is so entertaining,that actually cannot leave it from your hands...the most interesting is that &quot;stupid&quot;(?) Schweik is proved finally more clever than the other characters who search for glory,fame,recognition...who try to achieve something and gain something... This book is a Czechoslovakian Miracle...a masterpiece about a hero who has not the reputation of Alexander the Great or Napoleon...but somehow surpasses all the famous historical personalities...Scweik is the hero of Czechs and Slovaks without doubt.Read the book definitely...rarely you can find such stories and with many funny elements."},{"Title":"The good soldier Schweik (Penguin Books)","review":"Herr Schweik, who seems to have no first name, has established himself in the field of forging pedigrees for dogs thereby promoting mongrels to salons in Vienna under false pretenses. He is the creation of Jaroslav Hasek, who was (like the good soldier Schweik) conscripted into the Royal and Imperial Army of the Hapsburgs in 1915.Captured by the Russians, Hasek spent five years as a Prisoner of War and then found his way first into the Czech Legion under Russian command and then into the Bolshevik Army. Somehow, he got back to Prague in 1920 and began his masterpiece, THE GOOD SOLDIER SCHWEIK which was promptly banned by almost every army in the world.Why? Because it is a guide to the art of malingering. Schweik arrives at the recruit depot on crutches shouting patriotic slogans.Schweik survives the intricacies of the penal barracks, the lunatic asylum, the hospital and about everything else Fate throws at him.Schweik is Sad Sack on steroids and I found him funny, bawdy and a thorough rotter. In other words, the good soldier Schweik is a man for our time. Furthermore, I'm writing to Congress and recommending that this book be banned immediately from all military posts.Seriously, if you are interested in World War I, you'll find a perspective in THE GOOD SOLDIER SCHWEIK that a lot of old soldiers would probably recognize, but probably not comment on. It's worth having and I gave it five stars."},{"Title":"The good soldier Schweik (Penguin Books)","review":"I must first provide the caveat that this is the only translation of \\"The Good Soldier Svejk\\" that I've read, the 1930 translation by Paul Selver.

Also, even though the short bio at the start mentions that Hasek had \\"completed\\" 4 volumes of his intended 6, this paperback can appear confusing in that only 3 books are specifically laid out in the index and in this edition.By all accounts, the later translation by Cecil Parrott gives a fuller account of the Hasek original, such as including the 4th volume, left incomplete at Hasek's death, as well as being more explicit.

The authors present a new historiography of Santa Clara County, California that reveals a pattern of exploitation of people and resources dating from the Spanish Colonial period to the present. The book makes a compelling case that sustainability will remain elusive as long as for-profit capitalism rules the day.Pellow and Park study the area's historical development to find common threads between the past and the present. Each economic period was marked by the despoilation and depletion of California's natural resources, and in all cases, the production system was characterized by the exploitation of predominantly poor, immigrant and female labor.Interestingly, the authors show how the powerful have been consistently supported by their government sponsors even as the rights of the poor have been systematically denied. We find that the Spanish government's funding of the missionaries was not substantially different from the U.S. government's support of the California gold mining industry of the 1800s, the canneries of the early to mid twentieth century or the highly lucrative defense industry of today. Yet the indigenuous peoples and the poor immigrant workers who have labored in the fields and the factories have been consistently denied their political and economic rights. In this light, the fact that the poor suffer disproportionately from environmental injustices should not be surprising, or that the struggle to overcome the powerful interests that profit from the system remains difficult.The authors show how the electronics manufacturing that dominates Silicon Valley today is not the \\"clean\\" industry that is often promoted by corporate public relations firms. We learn how the so-called \\"immaterial\\" economy is in fact produced with enormous amounts of energy inputs and demanding physical labor. Management's criminal silence on issues pertaining to workplace safety and the pollution of the local environment clashes severely with the industry's oft-repeated hyperbole about the open and empowered society that is purportedly fostered through information technology.The author's analysis is supported with moving testimonies from flesh-and-blood workers who have suffered the ill effects of toxic exposure. Their heart-wrenching stories bring home the human costs of our high-tech culture in a deeply compelling way. But the authors also relate how grass-roots organizations have won modest victories in their attempts to protect workers and the community from harm. Clearly, the empowerment of women and minorities and respect for the environment is critical to achieving a sustainable and egalitarian society.I recommend this highly readable, insightful and important book to everyone."},{"Title":"The Silicon Valley of Dreams: Environmental Injustice, Immigrant Workers, and the High-Tech Global Economy (Critical America)","review":"you know, i went to school for two years in the silicone valley and whenever I tell people about what I learned from this book and the stories, people REALLY have a hard time believing me!That's how much of this corruption has been swept under the rug!If you've been wondering about this, READ IT!

I'm an avid student of history, and this is the best. More critical history of the world is compressed into this tiny book that I ever imagined possible.

It will instill in kids a love of history, and that is as good as a hundred books on history.Furthermore, it taught me a few critical things about history:1. Histories from one man's viewpoint really are the best kind. It is precisely the fact that Van Loon is with us, telling us the story, that makes it so exciting. A textbook with multiple authors and diligent weeding out of all viewpoint makes for passionless writing, and pleasureless reading. On the contrary, points of view animate us. They may indeed bias us, but they will motivate us to seek other points of view.2. Be kind to people and places different from your own. You might have done the same thing in that situation.

The thing about history is that, like the present, everyone interprets things differently.

For religiously historical stories of a less practical nature, one should really read their particular religion's prescribed texts.I found the book to be flambuoyant and enhanced by humour and opinion - qualities rarely found in history books.

This book must be especialy good for teens to start with human history. It is written in easy way but doesn't miss the major historical episodes and how the history flows and transits.

But when I ordered \\"The Story of Man\\", I had no idea the full-color illustrations and maps he designed to accompany the text were missing. Instead I got an A4-sized bound copy that advertised on the cover \\"High Quality Paperback\\". Hardly. The font is suitable only for manuscripts, not finished books, and the type is so light it's hard to see the text. Curiously, the editors used (sic) to point out mistakes in the original copy, but added many typos of their own, which of course were left untouched. But much worse is the missing maps and illustrations, which are an intimate part of the story. For example, his chapter on how hieroglyphics were invented and developed is incomprehensible without the four accompanying illustrations. It is worth reading his spirited histories (there are many of them) and contemplating his frequent original observations -- if you can get the illustrated version.

What's below is an excerpt from the current edition:\\"The civil rights movement escaped another defeat when the Reagan administration's attempt to grant tax exemptions to schools that discriminate against blacks failed. The economic future of young blacks remained bleak, as they continued to suffer the highest unemployment rate in the United States, while the government reduced many of the welfare programs that had helped the poor subsist.\\"Readers seeking a less partisan history are advised to find an older edition or to obtain E.H.

While he dealt with the ancients we were OK, although some chapters were entirely his opinion with no historical content whatsoever. I could barely accomplish the reading aloud of the Reformation chapter, but the next chapter made me give up this book as a History read aloud for homeschooled children entirely: Saint Ignatius is all wrong! If you are Catholic, or even Protestant--because Van Loon does justice to neither--Chapters 16 and 17 of Light of the Nations (Catholic Textbook Project) will give you a much better idea of the errors of the Church then, and of the Counter-reformation. For an older, wiser History student it would be OK, as Van Loon does have some delightful style bits and innovative History-telling perspectives. The book, is important to note, changes drastically in format midpoint, as if if the author pieced together things he had done in the past. The chapters become much longer and the reading/student level quite older. I would recommend both GombrichA Little History of the Worldand Hillyer's A Child's History of the World for children as better choices for a story-like classical History text at this point in the book!"},{"Title":"The story of mankind (A Star book)","review":"I am only up to page 90 of the 1939 edition, but I'm troubled by two purported letters about Jesus by a Roman physician Aesculapius Cultellus and his nephew Gladius Ensa.

The book is a much-compressed look at events, some facts obviously \\"of their time\\", from the beginning of time up to the \\"present\\". But is it also an opinionated, old-fashioned, wistful, and occasionally angry snapshot of the state of civilization, and more importantly **how educated people in Europe and America thought**, right after World War I, before Fascism and Communism were to wreck the world once again.Van Loon was born in the \\"old Europe\\", immigrated to and was educated in America. In 1921 he found himself on the threshold between a destroyed civilization and the rebirth of a new one. Now, as Earth begins to endure yet another cycle of destruction and renewal, those with open and especially young minds should read this book, put themselves in the shoes of Van Loon in 1921, duly note its anachonisms, and put aside policial correctness to think constructively about the never-ending cycles of history."},{"Title":"The story of mankind (A Star book)","review":"Written in 1922 , this book is a history of the world from pre-historic man to the First World War , written in a rather satirical , philosophical and whimsical style that makes it a great piece of literature.He deals quite comprehensively for 400 pages with this broad work on civilization.It also flows nicely.It is fascinating to read of the murder by the Bolsheviks of the Romanov family , as described by the author as a recent event.It is indeed written from the perspective of 1922:\\"The world has just passed through an agony of pain compared to which the French Revolution was a mere incident. The shock has been so great that it has killed the last spark of hope in the breasts of millions of men.

The name \\"Palestine\\" was invented in the year 135 C.E. Before it was known as Judea, which was the southern kingdom of ancient Israel. The Roman Procurator in charge of the Judean-Israel territories was so angry at the Jews for revolting that he called for his historians and asked them who were the worst enemies of the Jews in their past history. The scribes said, \\"the Philistines.\\" Thus, the Procurator declared that Land of Israel would from then forward be called \\"Philistia\\" [further bastardized into \\"Palaistina\\"] to dishonor the Jews and obliterate their history.

Van Loon's Story of Mankind is that book for me. Van Loon does a tremendous service to the study of history. Even though this is a childrens book Van Loon does not ignore or alter the facts of history so that he can comfort instead of educate the child who may be reading the book. And even though the book reads like one big bedtime story, Van Loon always tries to remain objective and never force his opinion on the reader. When he talks about Napolean he makes it very obvious that he does not like the man or what he stood for, but he also tells the reader that his grandfather fought alongside the man and that he(Van Loon) would have probably fought alongside him as well, that's just the kind of man Napolean was. At an age where you will believe almost anything told to you, especially by a man who has written a book, Van Loon tries to give the child both an appreciation for history and a sense of objectivity about events. This was one of the first books, if not the first book, that showed me that everything is not always black and white, good and evil, but shades and gradations of good and evil. I read this to all my nephews, and when they don't know what to read I hand them this book, hoping it will make them a wiser person for listening to Van Loon's lessons."},{"Title":"The story of mankind (A Star book)","review":"THE STORY OF MANKIND is a delight.

I am involved right now in a study of history textbooks, and I must say that I have trouble reading them because of their jumbled, jangly quality. I also have trouble lifting them because they are so heavy and overstuffed with trivia and pedagogical aids. With one or maybe two exceptions, most textbooks put more emphasis on visual glitz than on the quality of their text. By the time that these books emerge from the political process that is called state adoption, they lack voice and narrative power. They lack the very qualities that make historical writing exciting.

It concentrates mostly on European history since van Loon, in the early 1920s, is attempting to explain those factors that were present in the world at that time. His son William has written several new chapters which expand this view (his father had passed away in 1944). And, I have seen editions that are furthur updated.

Modern editors have tried to bring the book up to date by including major world events since van Loon originallywrote the book, but their writing doesn't have the insight that made van Loon's writings what they are.Van Loon traces the history of mankind from the beginning, starting with a brief geologic description of planet earth.His writing makes it seem as if you are reading a docu-drama, and you'll keep wishing that he could spend moretime on each topic.I especially enjoyed the sections on the middle ages and renaissance, and this book serves as a goodintroduction to history for children with writing that brings history to life.At times, given when this book was originally written, you may be struck by van Loon's eurocentric flavor, butoverall, he does a remarkable job in providing a well balanced presentation of all major world events. He does a great job oflooking at major world religions.This is not an exhaustive epic of the history of humanity, ratherit is an excellent introduction to history. Sadly, not many historiescan claim to be as entertaining as this volume. Perhaps if more were, historywould not be viewed with dread."},{"Title":"The story of mankind (A Star book)","review":"As a history minor and professional journalist I've read my share of history books but by far this book is the best I've ever read. Sure there are more scholarly volumes written on the rise of humanity but the author takes our collective tale and puts it in a form in which children can understand and adults can draw joy from. By all means this is a kids book but when you consider how many of us have been pushed away and unknowingly punished by history professors who thought it more important to tell us dates and not the story of the people making the dates significant, this book can be a valuable asset to adults. In a world which is being dumbed down this story, written on a childs level, may even be more apperciated. However to say this text is &quot;DUMB&quot; or lacking intelligence and well crafted words would be an injustice.. It's an incredible book. I have the hard back volume and it will stay in my family for the rest of time. I look forward to the day when my youngest son returns it to me after reading it and says, &quot;Thanks dad&quot;.

So far I haven't encountered such a well-written book that is dedicated to teaching children about history. The schoolbooks may have fancy pictures, text, and so on, but they always drone on and on using whole pages for one simple thought or idea. The Story of Mankind is different, in a simple but extraordinary way. The book reaches out to all parts of history yet does not run around important details to get to a slightly larger event. In my eyes, The Story of Mankind is more interesting and teaches more than the typical schoolbook. I can't understand why schools don't include this book in their history program. If this book were a part of the curriculum I would be very content knowing that a great Newberry book is being read in every school and possibly by every person in the world.

Despite its wonderful presentation, this book is too radical and too slanted to be recommended as a properly balanced source for use in educating children.Uniformed Catholic bashing is ubiquitous in our Anglosphere. I realize many will think I am mistaken in my opinion However no one should excuse jingoistic historical amnesia, no matter how commonly it is accepted.For example, the sadistic exploits of \\"Bloody Elizabeth\\" are swept under the rug.

This fine translation is very readable, and gives us a look into the emotional world of a mother separated from her child - her fear, concern, anguish, pride, resentment, and resignation.For students of history, the book has a great deal to show us, from Dhuoda's evident high level of education to the occasional fascinating details of her life story. Incidentally, this book also puts the lie to those historians who have claimed from time to time that medieval people did not grow attached to their children, or even that they did not love them! Although we know from other sources that Dhuoda's son's life did not end happily, we know little about Dhuoda herself beyond this book. In short, Dhuoda's viewpoint is a powerful and important one, and is easily accessible to the modern reader."},{"Title":"Handbook for William (Medieval Texts in Translation)","review":"Idle things to consider: her husband was Bernard of Septimania. Septimania! How can you go wrong with toponymy like that?Handbook for William is a delightful, fascinating, and (yes, I'll say it) touching text. It has an almost fantastic (as in the genre) quality to it. Dhuoda is of interest to anyone with a taste for Carolingian Studies (a Radisson ballroom-sized group of people, I imagine), or in any number of medieval disciplines (women's studies, family life, religion, etc.)The book it most closely reminds me of-- in overall flavor, rather than content-- is The Book of Margery Kempe. It has that same intimacy, that same semi-confessional, semi-conversational flavor. Considering it is basically a very long letter written from a mother to her teenage son, one can expect that. Over a thousand years later, Dhuoda comes across as an actual human being (not merely an Historical Personage of Some Note) and, because of the \\"handbook\\" aspect of her work, you're not constantly evaluating her motives (e.g., Caesar's \\"Conquest of Gaul\\")Her concern for her husband (a traitor to the King!) and children (held hostage!), her own declining health, her isolation and loneliness, her desire to both aide her children and leave something of worth behind... it is very provacative. Her notions of what a boy should know are also fascinating, touching on everything from \\"how to suck up to the king even though he's probably going to kill you,\\" her weird Christian Mysticism and numerological obsessions, and even her pride in her learning and the quality of her work reveal things about the late Empire that are not covered anywhere else (e.g., what a woman of high social status would know and what she'd teach her children). There is even a faint whiff of \\"hey this is pretty good, other people should check this out.\\" That sense not only makes you \\"like\\" her, it makes it a little amusing when she's wrong about things, too. Thoroughly great stuff, easy to read, and food for thought on intellectual and emotional levels, historical and philosophical levels, all sorts of levels.This translation is excellent, and the book is good quality. Buy it, read it, tell your friends. Dhuoda deserves a more widespread fame."},{"Title":"The Boys of Winter: Wisconsin's State Basketball Champions, 1956 & 1957","review":"\\"I saw this book on the Amazon web site, and had to send for it, as I am from the same little town in north-central Wisconsin as the author, John Cantwell. In fact, my father, Larry Fenton, was the 7th grade basketball coach, and there's even a photo of that winning team as 7th graders with him in the book. The book itself is a compilation of what happened in 1956 and 1957 with the high school boys' basketball team and Coach Kenney. Various team members supply their recollections, and the author captures the spirit of town. Dr. Cantwell also writes about the life experiences of the players since that magical time. These \\"boys\\" were and are legends in Shawano, WI. I grew up hearing about their excellence and winning games. It was great fun to read, although the market for this book may be somewhat limited, as its subject is so specific to a time and place."},{"Title":"Modern Parties (Modern)","review":"From cocktail party to dinner party to after dinner drinks this book is for people with more style than time.

After reading your reviews abour this book i felt i must say something. WHy are you so set against God and Christianity? One of you said this book was what made him rejest Christianity. Christianity is not some weird religion, it is the faith that Jesus Christ died for all humans, who He loves so much. Where are you going after you die? Christ is waiting for you to call to Him and ask for eternal life. The Bible isnt some whack job scribbling stuff down, it is God inspired. There are more manuscripts and texts to prove the Bible is real and written by those who claimed to write it. there are more manuscripts than that of Homer's The Odyssey, yet we regard that as true. So the Gospels werent written right after the disciples were with Jesus, but they were written at a time when those people could still remember their times with Christ. I am going to wrap it up now, but if you want to hear the real TRUTH, read God's Word. If you don't believe that, there are so many books that so the incredible evidence for the Bible. The Age of Reason was written by a man who hated Christianity. PLease do not just accept his writing without looking at the BIble. Jesus Christ loves you, and he longs for you to accept Him so He can change your life and give you the awesome gift of eternal life with Him. Thank you!"},{"Title":"The age of reason: Being an investigation of true and fabulous theology","review":"The Age of Reason is realy the best book there is to discover or re-discover Deism! In an age where you usualy have the choice between revealed, dogmatic (and sometimes fanatic)religions and cold atheism, this small, easy-to-read book by the Apostle of Freedom gives you another REASONABLE choice: Deism. Unlike other books written on religious philosophy, The Age of Reason uses plain, understandable language for everyone. After all, today, DEISM is a very un-known word, but yet, how many are un-counsciously Deists! I strongly recommand &quot;The Age of Reason&quot; to anyone who has left Christianity and wishes to satisfy his God-given reason. Anyone interest in religion and/or Deism ought to have this book: the closest thing to a 'deist-gospel' there is."},{"Title":"The age of reason: Being an investigation of true and fabulous theology","review":"If Cosimo do employ a proof-reader, he or she ought to be sent for a drugs test, or investigated for being a fundamentalist Christian deliberately trying to sabotage this masterpiece, the first logical attack on Christianity's shaky beliefs. Or should I say, they should consider a lawsuit against the printers. Those were my thoughts as I went through the book. The text often stops in mid-sentence, where another one will start, and you have to search halfway down the page to find how the sentence before had ended. Then to the end of that paragraph, and back up half a page to where you left off. By then you've lost the flow of the sentence and have to repeat the procedure. The footnotes have been allowed to mix in with the main body of the text in a confusing manner the likes of which I have never seen in a book before. That's besides the host of other routine misprints which alone would have been worthy of criticism. Using 21st century technology, Cosimo have surely been beaten in the accuracy game by the publishers/printers of the 1795 original. Naturally, none of this is the fault of Thomas Paine, and the book itself is a great read, and surprisingly readable for a book from that era. Like some have pointed out though, later scientific discoveries, like the theory of evolution for example, or the 19th century archaeological discoveries of the Middle East which showed the origins of a number of classic biblical stories, may have led Paine to rethink some of his statements on the universe and existence of God, and refine his opinions. But what he worked out and argued alone, without the help of much source material, is much to be admired. That he could have done so in an age of incredible ignorance leaves one all the more astounded that over two centuries later there are still so many followers of this destructive, immoral and unethical religion which has blighted our planet for so long, when the source material which Paine would have died for to use in his arguments is now at our fingertips. So read the book, just not this Cosimo version."},{"Title":"The age of reason: Being an investigation of true and fabulous theology","review":"Very thought provoking!

You need to argue amongst yourselves to decide whose \\"imaginary friend\\" is real. All of you have been engaged in putting each other to death-- essentially over what you believe happens AFTER death-- for thousands of years. Leave us out of it. We have no orders from imagined egomaniacs in the sky for an agenda of bigotry, bloody crusades, or missions to fly planes into buildings.Odd that your \\"omnipotent\\" gods aren't strong enough to do all that killing for you."},{"Title":"The age of reason: Being an investigation of true and fabulous theology","review":"Thomas Paine uses reason and logic to demonstrate, in his opinion, that the Bible (Old and New Testaments) is a convoluted and contradictory collection of historic fables written by anonymous authors, and subsequently voted by a group of \\"Christian Mythologists\\" as \\"the word of God\\". Paine expresses many of the problems that Christians have had regarding the Bible but were perhaps afraid to question.Paine is a master of the quip, and this is sure to insult some readers, while delighting others. Paine's writing is very direct and, at times, intentionally insulting. For example, Paine notes the unusual \\"Christian arithmetic\\" where three are one and one is three. Or in response to the preaching of tithes based on Deuteronomy ch. 25, v. 4, \\"Oh, priests! priests! ye are willing to be compared to an ox, for the sake of tithes\\".Paine had intended that a discussion on religion would be his last work. Due to the changing nature of the French Revolution, Paine realized that his liberty was to be short-lived, so he quickly composed the first part of the Age of Reason in Dec. 1793 and Jan. 1794. He had no Bible at hand, and as such the discussions are general. Within hours of completing the first part, he was arrested. In a few months and after a serious illness, Paine was released from prison. In 1795 he wrote the second part of the Age of Reason partially in response to written criticism of the former part by priests. This time Paine had a Bible, and he composed a detailed book-by-book attack.Typically using no more than the Bible itself as evidence, Paine points out so many inconsistencies and immoralities that this work could not possibly be the word of God. An example inconsistency is Christ's two vastly different natural genealogies according to Matthew and Luke, and an example immorality is Numbers 31, 17-18. Paine thought that the collapse of \\"revealed religion\\" was imminent, as mankind entered a new age of reason. However, Paine was no more a prophet than those of the Bible, as reason is no match for faith in the short term.While criticizing Christianity, Paine promotes his own religious belief, Deism, which was a common tenant of intellectuals in Paine's day, including Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson. In short, deism recognizes one God as revealed to us by nature. One may reasonably consider that some of Paine's Deist beliefs also crossed the line between reason and faith."},{"Title":"The age of reason: Being an investigation of true and fabulous theology","review":"Within the next revisions of this magnificent book, you will find one single low rate provided by Mr. Chad Woodburn, in which he ascribes a letter to Benjamin Franklin, condemning Thomas Paine for writing The Age of Reason.I find it very difficult to be true, since Ben Franklin died in 1790 while The Age of Reason was written in late 1793.This sort of logical criteria, is the one that Thomas Paine uses throughout his book to unmask lies told to us from early childhood."},{"Title":"The age of reason: Being an investigation of true and fabulous theology","review":"Age of Reason was an excellent book, it DESTROYED Christianity in my eyes, its nice to live without the irrational fear that there is a tyranical GOD breathing down your neck.....All hail Thomas Paine"},{"Title":"The age of reason: Being an investigation of true and fabulous theology","review":"I am ashamed to confess that I came to read this book so late in my life.

I observe that the negative reviewers here are using some of these tactics still.One reviewer commented that many of Paine's contemporaries rejected this book, which is a classic \\"appeal to authority\\" fallacy. (And in the case of the quotation by John Adams, what I know of him and his views on religion makes me doubt very seriously that he ever said what the reviewer attributes to him here.) So what if many of his contemporaries rejected it? Had any of them studied the Bible in the kind of depth Paine had? Why should their authority count for more than Paine's in this case? More importantly, why should you, the reader, be expected to dismiss Paine based on what others said, rather than judging for yourself?Another of the negative reviewers referred to this book contemptuously as \\"a dated pile of poop\\", yet had absolutely nothing convincing to say in the way of refuting any of Paine's arguments. The best he can come up with is assertions that Christ instills faith and the contradictions were taken too literally by Paine. But if the book is so dated, why is it that, as I said earlier, no Christian apologist has been able to offer a convincing, reasonable refutation of Paine's arguments in the two centuries since this book was published? If anything, the Bible looks even shakier now than when Paine wrote \\"Age of Reason\\", since scholarship has since uncovered more errors in the Bible, and science has proven Biblical assertions about the origins of man, the earth and all life wrong again and again.Another reviewer insists again that Paine is making too much of the contradictions, especially in the resurrection story, and that the overall story is what counts. Such critics are missing the point. Paine has noted, correctly, that the resurrection story is a two thousand year old story (1800 in his day), of which no original manuscript survives, which makes some vary extraodinary claims; the story is corroborated nowhere else (even though the works of about sixty historians alive at that time have survived to the present day), and the story CONTRADICTS ITSELF! Face it, this is not the most reliable source material; and yet oceans of blood have been spilled over the message contained in it.Paine was right, reason is a better way. Some people need to wake up and start using theirs."},{"Title":"The age of reason: Being an investigation of true and fabulous theology","review":"Paine's work masterfully exposes the Christian religion as the silly superstition that it is. He clearly shows the fallacies of accepting any divine &quot;revelation&quot;(think about it, if God wanted to tell you something, why wouldn't he tell you himself; or at least give you enough information to distinguish the true prophets from the false ones)and exposes many of the contradictions of the Bible as well as undermining the absurd doctrine of biblical infallibility. I now turn to some of the comments posted by Christians on this and other skeptical works: The Christian's favorite ploy is to argue that one must have &quot;faith&quot;(belief in the abscence of evidence and/or argumentation)in order to understand their mythology. However, if the Christians honestly believe that only if we believe a position will we be able to understand it, then why do they bother criticizing skeptical views? Surley they can't understand skeptical arguments without first being skeptics themselves. How do they know that we atheists are not able to access some special rational insight that non-atheists cannot have? As you've undoubtebly noticed, these are poor reasons for being an atheist-yet this is exactly the rationale many Christians use to justify their belief in God. Another common defense is to claim that the Bible's failings do not disprove the Christian religion. But if the Bible is thier one and only revelation from God and they acknowledge that it is chock full of erorrs, what is left to base their belief on? How can they claim that any narrative of rape, pillage, and genoicide (such as the Old Testament) is &quot;divinely inspired&quot;? What kind of divinity would inspire such a monstrous work? Paine was correct when he said that the Bible would be better called the word of a Demon than the word of God. If we cannot accept the Bible, then we cannot accept Christainity, period. Paine even gave an enlightening response to the religous apologists who attempted to refute the first part of his manifesto and defend the Bible, striking at the heart of Christianity when he said of the apologists &quot;each understands it [the Bible] differently, but each undersatnds it best, and they have agreed in nothing but in telling their readers that Thomas Paine understands it not.&quot; Unfortunatley for the Christains, Thomas Paine understood it all too well."},{"Title":"The age of reason: Being an investigation of true and fabulous theology","review":"Thomas Paine was one of the intellectual leaders of the American Revolution. Unfortunately, he is neglected in U.S. education today because of his enlightened views. His books \\"The Age Of Reason\\" and \\"The Rights Of Man\\" should be required reading for all students. For me personally, this is one of the ten most influential books I have read.This book is a superbly written, logical, clear analysis of revealed religion in general and the Judeo-Christian mindset in particular. As Paine points out, revealed religion is really second-hand religion for everyone but the original so-called prophets or inspired writers who received the message. For everyone else, their faith is really in the veracity and sanity of the people who claim to have had certain revelations. Paine points to the historical and scientific mistakes and the self-contradictory passages in the bible. He also points to the moral flaw in the whole concept of the so-called \\"chosen people\\", as well as to many other moral deficiencies in the biblical law. Chief among them is the idea that the creator of the universe would command a nomadic tribe to wipe out the original inhabitants of Canaan so they could worship him there.Paine points out that the best way to understand the creator is to study the universe he has created. His morality is based on common sense ideas which are accepted today in every advanced society. There is a creator, an immortal soul, and punishment and reward in the afterlife. It is based on philosophical arguments.Paine was not just a writer. He was a revolutionary soldier and a very courageous champion of liberty and moderation both in America and France. In other words, he put his life on the line for his beliefs, as much as any religious person.If you want to read the views of a true hero of enlightenment and human progress, buy this book! Give it to your children to read, because they certainly won't get it in school. It will not only teach them the truth about so-called revealed religion, it will teach them how to think and write clearly on a controversial topic.For those who are still struggling with religious belief, read this book! It may help you think more clearly about the whole subject."},{"Title":"The age of reason: Being an investigation of true and fabulous theology","review":"Since so many able reviewers have provided insightful and lengthy reviews of this book, I shall keep my comments short.This book, to put it simply, should be THE starting point for any and all who question or wish to think about the doctrines of (primarily) Christianity, though the discussion of the Old Testament clearly has relevance to Judaism, too. Paine makes an assault on these religions, and utterly rejects their holy books and doctrines, because he sees them as horribly divergent from what a rational conception of God requires. Paine explicitly advocates Deism, but the arguments he makes are equally useful to atheists, agnostics, theists, and all others interested in religion.These arguments may not be accepted as decisive by all, but they will indubitably cause any open-minded individual to seriously consider them. This is simply one of those books that anybody who seriously considers the philosophy of religion must read."},{"Title":"The age of reason: Being an investigation of true and fabulous theology","review":"Thomas Paine was an English born American who was instrumental in the cause of American independance and is considered to be one of our most important founding fathers. In 1798 he wrote The Age of Reason which was a controversial piece on his thoughts concerning religion. It attacked Christianity, judaisim and to a lesser extent, Islam.During the time the piece was written, the church was still very powerful and people were hardly receptive to such criticism of the bible. One would think that given the religious climate of America at the time, Paine would make an effort to question the authenticity of the bible in the most subtle and respectful manner possible. Paine however does no such thing. When considering the time period the book was written, the reader cannot help but laugh at some of the words and phrases Paine uses to describe the bible. I can hardly imagine how the simple, humble christians of 1798 must have gasped when reading Paines words.Paine routinely refers to the bible as \\"stupid\\", \\"ridiculous\\" \\"absurd\\" ,\\"a book of fables\\" and \\"a nonsensical lie\\" among others. I was stunned at his \\"in your face\\" style. Although the writing is bold and provocative it is still eloquent and articulate.The thrust of Paines argument is that God would never reveal himself to us via written religous text. Such text would easily be misinterpreted and corrupted by the hand of man. He points out obvious discrepencies in the acts of Jesus found in various books of the new testament. Some are small, like the books of the bible differ on the geneology of Jesus, some are big like when he states \\"According to Matthew the eleven were marching to Galilee, to meet Jesus in a mountain, by his own appointment, at the very time when, according to John, they were assembled in another place, and that not by appointment, but in secret, for fear of the Jews.\\" Both books cannot be right about this because Jesus couldnt be in 2 different places at the same time. One contains a falsehood. Paine argues that if we cannot believe some of the more trival parts of the bible that we know to be false, why should we believe the fabulous parts, like that of the virgin birth?Paine goes to great pains to impress upon the reader his sincere belief in the existance of God and that of an afterlife. He was no athiest dispite what others have said. Those who accuse him of such have not read The Age of Reason.Personally the paragraph of the book that had the greatest impression on me and probolly summarized the book to some extent was the following\\"To be happy in old age it is necessary that we accustom ourselves to objects that can accompany the mind all the way through life, and that we take the rest as good in their day. The mere man of pleasure is miserable in old age; and the mere drudge in business is but little better: whereas, natural philosophy, mathematical and mechanical science, are a continual source of tranquil pleasure, and in spite of the gloomy dogmas of priests, and of superstition, the study of those things is the study of the true theology; it teaches man to know and to admire the Creator, for the principles of science are in the creation, and are unchangeable, and of divine origin.\\"For me this is one of the most profound and brilliant statements I have read. I encourage everyone to read this book and give it serious thought. Be prepared to question your most cherished beliefs. Those who dismiss Paine as having misinterpreted the bible or taken the bible too \\"literally\\" only serve to prove Paines assertion that God would never reveal himself to mankind through a mysterious book often written in abstract terms whose meaning is open to interpretation.The reviewers who attack the book most likely didn't read it. This is especially true for the reviewers who cite that Franklin had harsh criticism of the book. Anyone who actually read the book would notice that Paine only speaks of Ben Franklin in the past tense, thats because Paine didnt start writing The Age of Reason until his imprisonment in France in 1793. Franklin died in 1790"},{"Title":"The age of reason: Being an investigation of true and fabulous theology","review":"Thomas Paine's &quot;Age of Reason&quot; is a brilliant refutation of the Christian Bible. Paine affirms his own deistic belief in a kind and benevolent Creator and then proceeds to point out the many frauds of Christianity. He exposes the inconsistancies, the contradictions and outright falsehoods of the Bible. Paine also shows how the christian clergy uses religion and dogmatism as engines of power, control, and profit.Paine presents a view of a Creator who is powerful,yet benevolent. Paine also points out that the way to serve God is to do good to your fellow man, not to battle over mystic and incomprehensible doctrines. If you are a freethinker or a christian,and have an open mind the &quot;Age of Reason&quot; is a brilliant &quot;bible&quot; of freethought and is a must read."},{"Title":"The age of reason: Being an investigation of true and fabulous theology","review":"This book is like the bible for Deists. You don't have to be a Christian to believe in God. Thomas Paine makes that very clear. Instead of following the Bible to find the Creator, Paine follows nature, science, and reason to come to the conclusion that God exists.Using reason, the author shows why the Bible cannot be the word of God. In an age without the printing press, it wasn't hard for writers to change sentences or omit certain words. In fact, at the end of the essay, Paine mentions how a printer in America changed a sentence in the first part of Age of Reason. The New Testament is at least 1700 years old, so it's extremely likely that we are reading an altered form of the Bible.One intangible is language. The original Bible was written in Ancient Greek and Hebrew. Parts of the Bible are lost in translation. Would the \\"Word of God\\" really come in human language? Paine doubts it. It's impossible to convey the same message in two different languages. Instead, the Word of God is Creation itself. It's a universal language. It requires no translation, and everybody can experience it.You do not need to be a Bible scholar to read this book. While it's probably good to have a frame of reference, anybody can understand the message Paine is making. Paine writes about fundamental contradictions in the accounts of the authors of the New Testament. Luke and John have different versions of the resurrection, and about the events after it. While they both mention a meeting with Jesus, they don't elaborate. Nobody has any idea what Jesus said after the resurrection. Don't you think that would be an important scene?I enjoyed Paine's sharp commentary and witty writting. He really was a firebrand. Paine was correct, however. Reason is a very powerful tool, and it leads us to the true theology: \\"Do we not see a fair creation prepared to receive us the instant we are born- a world furnished in our hands, that cost us nothing?\\""},{"Title":"The age of reason: Being an investigation of true and fabulous theology","review":"Thomas Paine's The Age of Reason was the deciding factor in my decision to reject Christianity as a truthful world-view. I struggled for years, growing up in an evangelical church, with the idea of accepting the blood of a god-man as the ultimate resolution to humanity's shortcomings. I am so thankful for the enlightenment that Paine's work introduced to me. I couldn't personally affirm the Bible's accounts of prophecy and miracles were works of fiction until I read Age of Reason.Paine writes in such a manner that is sometimes impetuous, but always guided by common sense. This is why Paine is so fun to read! While reading (more than twice) I would frequently slam the book down and exclaim \\"That's so true!\\". This work has survived the test of time. It continues to speak to fresh generations of free-thinkers. Age of Reason is an excellent introduction into other works of higher Biblical criticism, like those of Dr. Robert M. Price, who, if you haven't heard of him, is a brilliant scholar.If you loved Age of Reason, try The Incredible Shrinking Son of Man, by Dr. Price. It's far more researched, and provides further insight into many of Paine's arguments.My only hesitance to the Age of Reason is that I get the sense that Paine honestly believed that the church would crumble after he wrote his book. For example, he wrote \\"I have now gone through the Bible, as a man would go through a wood with an axe on his shoulder, and fell trees. Here they lie; and the priests, if they can, may replant them. They may, perhaps, stick them in the ground, but they will never make them grow.\\" and \\"Certain as I am that when opinions are free, either in matters of government or religion, truth will finally and powerfully prevail.\\"Although I vehemently agree with Paine in both cases, and I hope that TRUTH will finally prevail, it seems the world is growing more in superstition and not less. Paine's success in instigating a revolution of government certainly encouraged him in attempting a revolution of religion. No free-thinker can blame him for hoping, but for being so certain I may have to. Although the time-period in which the book was written may excuse his overconfidence.Age of Reason is a great classic, and a work of genius. If you don't own this book you should."},{"Title":"The age of reason: Being an investigation of true and fabulous theology","review":"Thomas Paine's \\"Age of Reason\\", which earned him hatred and ridicule to this day, is nothing less than a brilliant exposure of the fraud and unhappiness on mankind that organized religion has been throughout the ages and continues to be.The man whom Theodore Roosevelt called \\"A Filthy Little Atheist\\" (Paine was a Deist, by the way) opens with some general observations on revealed religion and proceeds to demonstrate, through stringent logic, that the Bible, the so-called \\"Word of God\\", is really nothing but a collection of anonymous tales, and as such is without authority. A must-read for all Christians."},{"Title":"The age of reason: Being an investigation of true and fabulous theology","review":"I read this book and am reviewing it as a former christian. I left the church and the christian religion many years ago,thank goodness! I now call myself a deist and belief wise, deism is what I now see is the only true path for myself and I am just now getting around to have read the book. I would have still ended up leaving the religion anyway, whether I read the book or not,It was just basically a question of when I would eventually leave the religion. But after having read the book now, it has only more deeply confirmed for me and convinced me that I made the right decision for myself by earlier leaving the church and the religion.I think every Christian should read this book. It should be required reading especially for fundamentalists and evangelicals. But be forewarned, this book isn't for the faint or weak of heart and not for those who don't like to have their personal Christian beliefs and faith challenged, which is exactly what this book will do. It will not only challenge your faith and your personal belief in the bible and Christianity in general, it will also quite possibly destroy it for you as well.Thomas Paine, an idealist,a radical and a master rhetorician, was definitely a man with a self appointed mission with this book, He so completely and so totally destroys the bible and decimates and obliterates it like no one I have ever seen before. He is completely thorough in his devastation and destruction of the bible. He holds no punches.Nothing in the bible escapes his visciousness. He attacks the bible from within, using only the bible to prove the absurdities and contradictions and fallacies and falicious lies contained within it. He uses the bible as proof to disprove itself. He is relentless and ruthful in his attack and he doesn't let up for a single moment.From the very start, he comes out swinging, in his examination of the old testament.Methodically and systemically, book by book,chapter by chapter and verse by verse, he rips out the internal guts of the bible,and he lays it out in the open,and exposes it for all to see it for what it is. He metaphorically swings the bible like an axe with deadly accuracy,precision and aim, when he is done, and the smoke and the dust cloud settles, the bible lay heaped and crumpled up,mortally wounded in the corner,just a shell of a book,all that is left of it.Thomas Paine, makes you definitely stop and think as you read it. As you read his book, I highly suggest opening your bible and lay them side by side, and you can follow along,step by step, and virtually walk with him down the bloody path of annihlation and destruction which he will leave in his wake. It's easy to see, he was way ahead of his time when he wrote this book. He was centuries ahead in terms of thinking,when he wrote this book, and it's easy to see why alot of people in his time didn't want to accept his ideaology. I can easily imagine he made alot of enemies for himself when he wrote this. Alot of people must have absolutely hated him after he wrote it, and it's easy to see the controvercial firestorm he set off when he opened this can of worms. He was too radical for his time and people weren't ready for the book or for his particular way of thinking.People couldn't easily accept him or his book at that time.Even though this book was first published in 1795, it almost seems as if he were writing it for our modern times. This book really speaks so much to our present modern day world and our society today and it's just as true and applicable today,as it was back in his time. Most christians probably have never ever read the bible through completely from cover to cover, while other christians mostly believe the bible only because they are told to believe it by family, and friends,associates ect.....Most American Christians don't even really know what's even in the bibleThe really amazing thing about his book....It cannot be refuted. no way. not even. I don't care who it is, I don't care what kind of education or theology degree a person has, you will find what Thomas Paine says about the bible is true, check it for yourself.open your bible and read the bible along with his book,side by side and follow along with him. You will find what he says is sincere,honest and straight forward. He has no reason to lie, but unfortunately the bible as well as the church has very good reasons to lie to society and to impose this book and their beliefs on the rest of the world.Any Pastor,Preacher,Bishop, clergyman, probably even the POPE himself would be definitely hardpressed and mentally challenged to even try to refute this book. Thomas Paine wrote this book in such a way, as for it to be virtually impossible for anyone to refute his evidence and his proofs and whoever tries to refute it, they will have their work cut out for them. This is the book your church and your Preacher or your Pastor doesn't want you to read.I for one am so glad I bought it and read it. It has changed me,personally and deeply. I don't see how I ever really used to believe in the bible before. I believe in God, very much, of course, don't get me wrong. I believe in God, I just don't believe in the bible,or in Christianity as an organized religion and I can now begin to see how the world and how our society would be alot better off without both the Bible and organized religion.Buy the book. Read it. face your fear and challenge your personal beliefs and faith if your strong enough and if your not afraid. Open your eyes!....see the truth!...be changed. Personally, I don't see how a person could buy this book and read it and not be a changed person by the time they are done reading it. Thomas Paine did a great service for both his society and ours when he wrote this book. This book will always be in my personal library of books. When your done reading the book, start from page 1 and read it again.One of the best books I have ever read, and wish I would have read it alot sooner."},{"Title":"The age of reason: Being an investigation of true and fabulous theology","review":"Paine, the man who coined the words &quot;United States of America&quot; and another of the USA's non-Christian founding fathers, has written what is easily the best book about deism, period. I personally do not accept the arguments from either design or the anthropic principle, so I am not a deist (luckily, you won't find nasty words like &quot;anthropic&quot; in this book, just some outdated English).But what this book does for biblical criticism is wonderful. Paine burns the &quot;Good News&quot; to ashes with his wit and brilliant prose. This book, although it would clearly violate the separation of church and state to have it read in schools, should nevertheless be read by young people (I read it when I was 18) who are interested in religion. Paine honestly looks at the bible, and finds it (correctly) to be a pack of lies.I won't quote from the book, but I can say that what you read in it will never be used by the religious right when they spout their drivel about our's being a Christian nation.We are lucky to have had an American as bold as Thomas Paine to write the truth about religion, I only wish there were people like that today."},{"Title":"The age of reason: Being an investigation of true and fabulous theology","review":"You have got to read this book. It is one of a kind. Many books have been written about the bible. This one, however, can be called the Genesis for bible criticism. Tom Paine's book is highly respectful with its subject, not rude in any sense. In fact, it simply lays out one man's opinion of a body of work that never made sense to him.It is a two part book, Age of Reason I and Age of Reason II. The first part was written without the aid of a bible. He refuted it strictly by memory! In part II he had access to the \\"Good Book\\" and successfully destablized its foundation. This is why his writing is so interesting. Paine makes a convincing argument that the bible cannot be a legitimate authority to live by.Overall, the book is well constructed and easily accessible. If anyone has read the Old or New Testament and has not read Tom Paine's Age of Reason, they have only got half the story. Buy this book. Read it. Talk about it with other bible readers.

It is my pleasure to recommend this book to any individual questioning the blind theology that we, as humans, are force fed from the day of our birth. The format of the first part of this book is composed of logic driven arguments as to the validity of biblical text. Paine uses the tools of reason and intellect to condemn the most influential text of the modern world with incredible precision. The second part of this book is the reaction to the average priests attempt to blindly nullify his arguments in the first part. With this Paine takes each section of the bible systematically and tears down the validity of every part of the new and old testament alike using the bible as its own weapon. A truly timeless and inspiring book."},{"Title":"The age of reason: Being an investigation of true and fabulous theology","review":"Thomas Paine:I believe in one God, and no more; and I hope for happiness beyond this life.I believe in the equality of man; and I believe that religious duties consist in doing justice, loving mercy, and endeavoring to make our fellow-creatures happy.But, lest it should be supposed that I believe in many other things in addition to these, I shall, in the progress of this work, declare the things I do not believe, and my reasons for not believing them.I do not believe in the creed professed by the Jewish church, by the Roman church, by the Greek church, by the Turkish church, by the Protestant church, nor by any church that I know of. My own mind is my own church.All national institutions of churches, whether Jewish, Christian or Turkish, appear to me no other than human inventions, set up to terrify and enslave mankind, and monopolize power and profit.I do not mean by this declaration to condemn those who believe otherwise; they have the same right to their belief as I have to mine. But it is necessary to the happiness of man, that he be mentally faithful to himself. Infidelity does not consist in believing, or in disbelieving; it consists in professing to believe what he does not believe.It is impossible to calculate the moral mischief, if I may so express it, that mental lying has produced in society. When a man has so far corrupted and prostituted the chastity of his mind, as to subscribe his professional belief to things he does not believe, he has prepared himself for the commission of every other crime. He takes up the trade of a priest for the sake of gain, and in order to qualify himself for that trade, he begins with a perjury.

Paine is NOT an atheist as claimed by fanatical believers. Paine is a Deist and an opponent of atheism. Paine dissects the Bible's origins, falsehoods, fables and contadictions. Paine had tremendous courage in writing this since religious belief is usually the most fanatical and anti-intellectual when it's fangs are extended. Paine wrote this to enlighten the human mind and show how organized religion warps the mind and causes reason and investigation to become trumped by superstition, metaphysics, and revelation. A great book to open the mind."},{"Title":"The age of reason: Being an investigation of true and fabulous theology","review":"The Age of Reason by Thomas Paine is a work of enormous weight. It is primarily a factually sound refutation of the Bible as being the \\"revealed word of God\\" as well as a passionate statement of his own religious belief, that of Deism. Paine must have been an extraordinary human being - certainly the attack of power-entrenched religious orthodoxy has been fatal to many that trod before him (as well as after) so I am firmly impressed by the man's courage. But beyond this I also \\"got\\" a profound sense of moral goodness - he speaks of the \\"Rights of Man\\" with such integrity that it violently stirred my own emotions.It would have been interesting to see what would have come from Paine had he known of the theories of Darwin, Einstein, Freud, as well as the modern theories of cosmology and physics, as it was these areas of natural science that inspired his belief in the Divine."},{"Title":"The age of reason: Being an investigation of true and fabulous theology","review":"Even though this book is not perfect, it has more than enough philosophical and historical value to qualify as a must read.The one thing that bothered me about the book is that Paine lets anger get in the way and it shows through in some of his weaker arguments and ad hom attacks. That aspect robbes him of some credibility, which is a shame because this book should be read and talked about.One of the most striking aspects of the book is not in the book itself but a reflection on it. Anyone who is exposed to Christianity in America is made aware of heroes of the faith who have accepted persecution and even death because they spoke out for Christianity. Well, here's a Deist who literally risked his life by writing this book. Did he do it for a heavenly reward? Apparently not because he wasn't sure that there was a heaven. He did it because of principles."},{"Title":"The age of reason: Being an investigation of true and fabulous theology","review":"Given the vitriol with which Christians have denounced Thomas Paine for more than 200 years, one may be under the impression, as I was, that he was an atheist. He was generally denounced as such, and Theodore Roosevelt's reference to him as a \\"filthy little atheist\\" was not atypical. But upon actually reading this famous tome of his, I discovered he was in fact a devout man of God. It was only Christianity and other organized religions he had a problem with, and he explains why.Paine was a creationist who believed nature is God's primary revelation of himself to humankind. In this revelation are all the tools we need, to understand, to behave, to treat others with respect and kindness, to stand in awe of the creator and worship him. Thomas Paine did not appreciate anyone belittling God by suggesting he behaved as \\"revealed\\" in those old writings of men who did dastardly things and then justified their behaviors by claiming God told them to do it! Paine could see that the biblical God was created by men the same way they created all the other pagan gods of the day. (Christianity was not the first to have a virgin birth, resurrections and blood sacrifices.)With no written description of God, and only the creation to go on, Paine was in the uncommon position of actually having to think for himself about what God must be like, what he expects of us, how we should behave. Thinking is work, but like most work, it can be invigorating and rewarding--written descriptions are severely limiting, confined to the words used, while one's imagination is limitless. (Similarly, the more literally one takes something, the more limited its application.) Unfettered by the feeble, misguided words of the ancients, Paine loved observing and imagining what God must be like.Those of us conditioned to getting our description of God through written material might at first think Paine to be at a great disadvantage. How silly, we are tempted to think, to imagine our understanding of God could be complete merely by looking around us. How could we possibly figure out that God wants us to have slaves, keep the Ten Commandments, offer sacrifices, flatter him more on Sunday (or is it Saturday?) and burn witches--all merely by observing nature? Then it dawns on us, and wow! If we believe God is good, then without these writings our imagination about his goodness is limitless. Throughout our lives, no matter how much we mature and grow in understanding, at any given moment we push the limits of God's goodness to the extremes of our imagination--never fully comprehending it, only approaching it. We are filled with awe and we are drawn to emulate that goodness. How silly all this stuff about a touchy biblical god who throws his weight around killing people at the drop of a pin if they don't offer the right sacrifice begins to look!Thus Thomas Paine was offended by the pettiness and absurdities of man-made religion. By observing God directly, he did not find himself in the awkward position of having to create excuses for God's supposed evil behaviors, his weird pagan-like fascination with blood sacrifices, his horrible temper or his morbid fascination with punishment--like stoning unruly kids to death, striking people dead for small infractions and imposing the death the penalty for every human being's mistakes, misdeeds or mere failures to flatter him (to say nothing of torturing them to death by endless fire). Paine wasn't saddled with the burden of explaining why the deity he worships doesn't want women in pulpits or gays in love. He's not stuck with having to defend fantastic promises that are (let's be honest) never kept, and prophecies never really fulfilled. Ironically, the only thing he ever had to defend was God's reputation--which Bible writers had dragged through the mud by attributing their own wicked pursuits to God.Paine's respect and adoration for God was pure, unadulterated by human contraption. In other words, he worshipped God without all the baggage. And all the while, Christians called him an atheist for not helping them carry theirs.It's worth noting that Thomas Paine's contemplation of God was not some kind of nebulous feel-good meditation. He was moved to action. In addition to defending God's reputation, Paine personally worked to end slavery, particularly with his 1775 essay, \\"African Slavery in America.\\" That makes Paine a better person than the biblical God, and not by a little; I mean, God isn't even neutral on slavery, he encourages it (emphatically and repeatedly, according to the Bible). And, of course, while Paine worked to end slavery, his biggest obstacle was Christians who defended the practice on clear biblical grounds. They got their understanding of God through a written description, while Paine got an entirely different understanding of God merely by contemplating God's real revelation, the creation.Would Paine still believe in God today? Who knows? When he died, Charles Darwin was but four months old. In that day, there simply was no plausible explanation for the origin of species.* Nearly everyone, including Paine, chalked it all up to God--the source of all things existing. Things of mystery have always been affairs of the gods.*(It is a common misconception among Christians that evolution attempts to explain the origin of life, but it does not.)But for the fact that Paine was not an atheist, one might consider The Age of Reason a foreshadowing of today's popular works by Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris and others. They and Paine all easily demonstrate how the writings that eventually got voted into the canon that is our present-day Bible could not possibly be a revelation from God. But unlike the others, Paine's purpose was to defend God's reputation, not doubt his existence.This book affords an additional plus. We get a fascinating glimpse of Paine's life and times in the 18th century, 200+ years ago. I was especially interested in his arrest over the nature of his writings. And while this review is a mere overview, Paine's meticulous tribute to \\"the age of reason\\" is a thing of real substance--you'll find detailed arguments not routinely employed by today's writers. You'll also get a more balanced view of deism than we usually get from Christians, who typically misrepresent it as a message of gloom and doom (God created us and then just \\"abandoned\\" us). The founding fathers of the United States were more deist than anything else, and thus not Christian, contrary to popular belief."},{"Title":"The age of reason: Being an investigation of true and fabulous theology","review":"Thomas Paine's &gt;&gt;The Age of Reason&lt;&lt; is a work of matchless clarity, boldness, and courage in an area the author obviously feels passionate about. Written more than two hundred years ago, it exposes the Bible for what, in my belief, it really is: A collection of myths and legends so arranged to enable certain clergy to &quot;terrify and enslave man,&quot; as Paine himself put it. You need not read any modern book on atheism or comparative religion or critiques of Christianity, for this classic work reveals so many of that religion's absence of foundation. Most of the objections about the Bible that were raised by Paine have not, to this day, been addressed by Biblical scholars and Christian apologists. This book is must reading for all skeptics of religion, as well as for all people who call themselves Christians who want to examine critically what they profess to believe."},{"Title":"The age of reason: Being an investigation of true and fabulous theology","review":"Thomas Paine makes as powerful and argument as one might hope to make against the idea that the Bible - both the Old Testament and the New Testament - can possibly be direct revelations from God. His logic is very sound that revelation only occurs first to one person, and after that to believe in revelation is to put a great deal of trust in the person to whom revelation was supposedly delivered. He also makes fine textual criticism of many parts of the Bible. While some of his analysis and criticism is not well-founded, the whole of his argument against revelation seems forceful. (five stars on that) Where I dissent with Paine is his overall bitter diatribe against the Christian religion itself (two stars on that). There is much yet good in the Christian message, and I wonder if Paine did not give enough credit to the Quaker belief system, which was undoubtedly formative for his father and for himself. Paine does not describe much about Deism as an alternative, save that it is faith in knowledge of God through Creation. One should read this book for its good (and not so good) arguments - but don't acquire the Nuvision Press copy. It is chalked full of embarrassingly bad typos that should have been fixed before publication."},{"Title":"The age of reason: Being an investigation of true and fabulous theology","review":"After the American Revolution, Tom Paine went to England on a hopelessquest to promote an invention. While there he was inspired to write TheRights of Man, his greatest political tract. The British government tookoffense, and Paine only just escaped arrest for sedition, crossing thechannel to revolutionary France. The French, whose own revolution owed nosmall debt to his writings, gave him a hero's welcome, but not much timepassed before he fell out of favor with the revolutionary government there.Aging, ill, and out of favor, his mind turned to philosophy and he began toput down &quot;my thoughts upon religion.&quot; He sets forth two themes at theoutset. First, contradicting the modern notion that he was an atheist, hewrote, &quot;I believe in one God, and no more; and I hope for happiness beyondthis life. I believe in the equality of man; and I believe that religiousduties consist in doing justice, loving mercy, and endeavoring to make ourfellow creatures happy.&quot; But a second theme dominates most of the book: &quot;Ido not believe in the creed professed by...the Protestant church, nor byany church that I know of. My own mind is my church. All nationalinstitutions of churches, whether Jewish, Christian or Turkish, appear tome no other than human inventions, set up to terrify and enslave mankind,and monopolize power and profit.&quot; And with that he deployed the full powerof one of the most amazing rhetorical voices ever raised, with no smalleraim than to destroy the credibility of all religion, and especially that ofthe Christian denominations. He completed the first part of the book theday the French arrested him; it was published while he spent months in acell waiting to be guillotined. Released at last, he sat down to completethe work. The second part is a detailed and savage deconstruction of theChristian Bible. When Paine wrote, the idea of examining the Bible as atext objectively, let alone critically, was unheard of. Paine finds many ofthe internal contradictions and barbarities of the Bible and lays them outwith withering scorn. After going through the Bible &quot;as a man would gothrough a wood with an axe on his shoulder, and fell trees,&quot; he lays out ina few pages a positive vision of the Deity he believes in and of a possibleafterlife. These quieter pages are touching and have an astonishingmodernity. However, Paine's contemporaries could not grasp the idea ofloving God while hating the Church, and decided that he was an atheist.Returning to the States, he was hounded and vilified the rest of his life,eventually dying in poverty. Finally, even his body was lost, and there isno Paine grave today."},{"Title":"The age of reason: Being an investigation of true and fabulous theology","review":"In \\"The Age of Reason\\", an angry, well-researched, and surprisingly witty book, Thomas Paine makes the case for deism.

Included in this edition is a very thorough biographical introduction to Paine, written by Philip S. Foner in 1948.The problem is that Paine's work depends largely on two basic assumptions, neither of which applies today. First, most of his criticisms of Judeo-Christianity are aimed at Biblical literalism. For instance: Matthew and Luke disagee about Jesus' ancestors; therefore the Bible is not divinely inspired. But many Christians today acknowledge some Biblical imperfections, and say that the underlying message is what's important. So errors of chronology and inconsistencies would not disprove the Christian religion. In fact, many more liberal Biblical scholars have devoted themselves to finding and explaining Biblical imperfections.I say this not because I disagree with Paine that Judaism and Christianity are false, but only because his critique is insufficient to deal with religion as it is practiced today. This book is sure to baffle any fundamentalist, though.The second problem is Paine's assumption that deism is the \\"true\\" religion. He bases this on the order of the world and universe, and because conditions on Earth are so amenable to man that a higher power seems likely. Paine was writing before Darwin's theory of evolution, however, which would have provided an alternate explanation for this. And explorations into black holes and the like have shown us that the universe is much more chaotic than we once thought. I can't help thinking that Paine would be an atheist, or at least an agnostic, were he alive today.Nevertheless, Paine's defense of science and his intellectual courage are outstanding. His book is well thought out and a lot of fun to read. We can't judge him by our scientific standards today; the criticisms are just something to bear in mind as you read the book, which you certainly should."},{"Title":"The age of reason: Being an investigation of true and fabulous theology","review":"I must agree with \\"troybert\\" that Rickythereader has an obvious agenda in his \\"review\\".Little Ricky is similar to the trolls who haunt progressive weblogs ready to defend their flawed pet causes and equally flawed heros with a plethora of misinformation, propaganda and outright lies. In this case with his 4 \\"reviews\\" (all 4 cut and pasted from one book review to another) of Thomas Paine's writings (specifically targeting Age of Reason) proves it is quite obvious that little Ricky is nothing more than Amazon.com religio-troll.First off Ricky -- what is the deal with your bizarre obsession of Paine's leaving school at the age of 12? Paine was born into an impoverished family in pre-industrial age England. The fact he left schooling at the age of 12, at which time he went to work as an apprentice with his corset-maker father, is neither extraordinary nor indicative of the level of the man's intellect at the time he wrote Age of Reason. Your constant harping on that theme alone throughout your review (meaning bitchy, intellectually bankrupt harangue) is reason enough to question your objectivity as well as well as the maturity of your cognitive thinking abilities (assuming they even exist in some measurable form or level).Secondly -- it's painfully clear you have either never read \\"Age of Reason\\" in it's entirety (both Part 1 & 2) or you read it with such a polluted pre-conceived bias towards the writer and subject as to leave no doubt as to the outcome of your faux \\"review.\\"I'd like to specifically address the absurdity (as in hilariously child-like absurdity) of the following statement by little Ricky:\\"A very interesting thing to note about Paine's beliefs is that if you apply his beliefs to his own work then you would PROVE in Paine's view point that HE never existed. Paine states that you cannot believe that Paul wrote the books of the New Testament attributed to him therefore the Bible is not true. This same principle can be applied to Paine's work to challenge Paine's very existence. None of us personally met Paine or verified that his writings were his own; we only have writings that we are told were written by Thomas Paine by others, and that the writings contained Paine's beliefs. If you apply this type of reasoning to Paine's own work then you would have to conclude that Paine's work might be a complete fabrication, and that there is no proof that he even lived that does not come from hearsay or documentation of other men.\\"IMFAO!! What a crock of imbecilic drivel! Paine's beliefs, in a nutshell, were rightfully questioning of the blind credibility granted to the \\"supposed\\" writers of the 4 Gospels by Christianity and it's purveyors (the clergy). As it turns out, and if you had any shred of honesty or capacity for reasoning you would acknowledge, even the most credible Theologians now take it for granted that the Gospels were not written by the individuals with the 4 names ascribed to them, Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. In fact by all available and examined evidence it is entirely probable the Gospels were written hundreds of years after the events they described supposedly took place. Paine simply noted that the anecdotal and contradictory writings of the Gospels (kind of amazing in itself when you consider they've been imposed upon the world as the divinely inspired recounting of the death of God's son and savior of mankind) ought to provoke suspicion in the minds of those with the ability to think and reason for themselves.The asinine proposition that perhaps Thomas Paine never \\"even lived\\" or \\"never existed\\" because he questioned the authenticity of the authorship of the Gospels has got to be one of the stupidest things I have ever read in my 45 years of living on this planet (oh wait -- maybe I never really lived or existed on this planet either because I too have questioned the authenticity of the Gospel's authors -- ROFL!). Using little Ricky's pre-kindergarten logic, it stands to reason that Paine's literary and political contemporaries, such as Thomas Jefferson, George Washington, Ben Franklin, Edmund Burke, Gouverneur Morris and many, many others, all of whom mention Paine in their own writings, also never lived or existed. Imagine that . . . a who's who of America's founding fathers historically re-classifed as nothing more than imaginary characters simply by guilt of association/recognition of the infidel Thomas Paine.In the end Ricky I ask you this -- is it not too subtly ironic that the title of Paine's incredible work \\"Age of Reason\\" was written over 200 years ago with unthinking, sanctimonious mental midgets like you specifically in mind? Will wonders never cease?"},{"Title":"The age of reason: Being an investigation of true and fabulous theology","review":"There has been a unique failure on the part of the educational system and the Left in America, which has left too many people with the mistaken impression that the Founders were a monolithic block of &quot;God-fearing&quot; Christians who intended to make this a nation based on Biblical principals above all.While not a Founder in the strictest sense, Paine's work had a profound impact on many of them, and his &quot;Common Sense&quot; laid the foundation for the American Revolution. His contribution to the cause of American Independence is certinly on par with that of Franklin, Jefferson, and other great thinkers who articulated the goals of the Revolution. By clearly and concisely stating an opposition to hereditary monarchy, Paine stirred the spirit of the patriots who would later put his words into practice. Would that they had done the same with &quot;The Age of Reason.&quot;&quot;The Age of Reason,&quot; while a little optimistic in its title, is a splendid indictment of Christianity and all other religions who purport to hold The One And Only Truth in their musty tomes. His belief in Deism, which was echoed by Jefferson, may seem a little dated to us now, as the rise of Atheism as a legitimate alternative (though the Christian litmus test for President still lurks among us) has made the need for a position between organized religion and Atheism largely unnecessary.This book should be required reading for all who would carve their sectarian inclinations into law. From politicians seeking to demonstrate that they are &quot;God's candidate&quot; to fundamentalists who would place religious laws on the walls of courthouses, our nation is in a dire need of a cool drink of Paine's wisdom.It is a good thing that he is not with us now- the posturing that politicians on both sides give to superstition and mysticism in their quest for votes would kill him again."},{"Title":"The age of reason: Being an investigation of true and fabulous theology","review":"Unlike so many books pointing out some of the absurdities of fundamentalism, this volume is neither shrill nor dry. Paine wrote one of the funniest, liveliest, wittiest volumes on religion there ever was. With a gifted eye for nonsense and logical inconsistency (allow Paine to walk you through the Bible and it will never seem the same to you again. He is able to point out so much that others have missed), Paine uses the scriptures as a basis for what amounts to being one of the funniest monologues ever written. He hammers home his arguments with a razor sharp intellect and a gift for the concise, epigrammatic, hilarious statement.It is too bad that Paine was better at working for others (the early colonies of the USA) than for himself. He died quite poor, almost completely forgotten and neglected, usually drunk, and often in the company of women who were beneath him. His fiery temperament was more suited to conflict and great causes than to retirement. Without a cause, he easily fell into dissolution. As so many other great men discover in their later years, the stimulation of the carnal appetites serve as a poor substitute for the excitements of their younger, more productive days. If it were not for the gift of a farm, he would have starved.The US owes him a great debt as his other writings galvanized the colonies and are pretty much the reason why we are no longer a part of Great Britain. I, for one, tip my hat to him."},{"Title":"The age of reason: Being an investigation of true and fabulous theology","review":"When reading the Bible, read it in a literal and logical manner. Taking each sentence of the word of God to be gospel and you will probably come to the same questions and conclusions that Thomas Paine, the author did in 1794.Make no mistake, this book will not be enjoyed by many. It is an attack on Christianity and the Bible but not an attack on God, which the author professes a belief in.Chapter after chapter breaks down the different books of the Bible and disects their words. How do they contradict themselves and each other? Can we prove or disprove that the books of the Bible were written by those who they are attributed? Read this book to find out.This book is for the person who can think for themselves and not accept everything that is spoon fed to them. I highly recommend it for those that can stomach a thought that might be different from what the masses believe. For those who like to analize and ponder. For those who have questions on religion and not faith. Read this book and enjoy it."},{"Title":"The age of reason: Being an investigation of true and fabulous theology","review":"Meticulous examination of the Christian religion and it's bible. It takes apart the bible piece by piece and leaves it in shreds. Anybody who isn' afraid to exercise the mind should read this book. And by the way to the guy who had that quote from Ben FRanklin condemning Paine's work, Ben Franklin died in 1790 but Paine wrote The Age of Reason years later so that quote you have is an absolute lie."},{"Title":"The age of reason: Being an investigation of true and fabulous theology","review":"And so do I.

Still Paine uses a few words that have different connotations like \\"fabulous\\" as meaning \\"as in a fable, meaning unbelievable\\" whereas its modern usage is more positive. All in all, this was quite illuminating.This is a must read for freethinkers everywhere, and especially those who think the founders of this country were all fire breathing Christians."},{"Title":"The age of reason: Being an investigation of true and fabulous theology","review":"Here is Paine's famous book-by-book attack on The Bible's authenticity and (to a lesser extent) case for Deism. It is informative and readable, well presented and (mostly) well reasoned.There are perhaps a half dozen or so times where his vitriol overtakes his reason, and the heat of his hatred for Christianity becomes rather tiresome, but other than that, I think his criticism holds much water.As to the science, I think that outside of a few times where he strays past the limits of the history and archaeology of his day this book holds up surprisingly well today.I would like to have seen more positive arguments for Deism as opposed to negative arguments against Judaism and Christianity (and Islam to a much lesser extent) but I think, probably, he was writing to an already Deist audience."},{"Title":"The age of reason: Being an investigation of true and fabulous theology","review":"Great read,The age of reason has been around for 220 years and I just got around to reading it. Should have read it 50 years ago.A bit repititive at times, but well written, in a language we can all understand and enjoy.Many will object because many are fixed in their ideas about religion.

To be born in America often means you profess some brand of Christianity. Christianity is certainly not all bad, but it is based on considerable superstition and myth.As \\"Age of Reason\\" reveals, the Bible is an interesting book, but not the infallible \\"Word of God\\". That is a total shocker to \\"evangical\\" Christians, but only because they have been brainwashed and their minds cannot be open to any ideas except those they have been taught.Thomas Paine was ahead of his time. He was a thinker with the ability to reason clearly. This book, if read with an open mind, could help our citizens to think more rationally about their responsibility for our country and our World. We need to wake up to the fact that no one is coming from outer-space to miraculously solve our problems and save us.We have minds and capabilities, and we need to get busy. Thankfully, we have scientists and engineers who understand this and are hard at work.Unfortunately our religious leaders and politicians are on a different track and have another agenda. It is an amazing game we are playing, and I pray America will not be the big loser. I believe that was Thomas Paine's prayer as well."},{"Title":"The age of reason: Being an investigation of true and fabulous theology","review":"one of the things thomas paine sets out to do is show you that the bible's authorship is spurious. another thing he will do is ask you to consider the plausibility of miracles. is it more likely nature would go out of her course or that man would tell a lie? thomas paine's main message in the age of reason is this: the bible disgraces god. it is full of lies, contradictions, errors, and doubts. and since doubts are the opposite of faith, of what value is the bible anyway? in the end thomas paine embraces science since the only way we can honestly know god is to study his creation.i think this book is valuable to believers and nonbelievers alike. paine is a believer himself, so there is no disrespect, yet he crushes believers' oldest weapon while advocating science which is something nonbelievers can take comfort in."},{"Title":"The age of reason: Being an investigation of true and fabulous theology","review":"Thomas Paine was a brilliant thinker, pamphleteer and some say blasphemous. However, this book is by far the most thought-provoking document I've read in a while. He discusses his personal belief in deism, and refutes Christian dogma and teaches the viewer to question things, such as the concept of \`mystery' and the fallacy of believing something just because others claim it to be true (revelations). He gives his opinion on major biblical/historical figures such as Moses, and the murders of innocents which occur throughout the old testament \`in the name of God.'In fact, it is just such elements which need to be questioned and have been used to brutalize the \`enemy' for centuries. There are two sides to every story. Paine's writing and gift for words is expressive and thought provoking. I'm glad I read this book, and I will do so again, because it was too deep to understand in one session.One thing to consider when reading Paine's world, is that in the world and time in which Paine lived Religion and dogmatic practice held sway over the populace. It was very different back then, and for Paine to write something like this would have him ostracized for life and would alienate many. Thus, I'm heartily convinced that Paine was also a brilliant and brave individual who wrote what he thought regardless of the consequences."},{"Title":"The age of reason: Being an investigation of true and fabulous theology","review":"The thoughtful reader will enjoy this classic.

Paine, a deist, had no respect for the god of the Judeo-Christian belief system, nor for the religion itself, and in this classic work makes points concerning the Bible and the history of Christianity that, to this day, have not been touched by Christian apologists. Truly a masterpiece."},{"Title":"The age of reason: Being an investigation of true and fabulous theology","review":"Thomas Pain's approach to every subject is from all sides.

Therefore, the bible can not be trusted as an accurate account for the things written in it.Furthermore, this book illustrates that the god of the bible is probably a human invention. We can say this because the bible is contradictory and its authors are unknown (which gives the bible no rational authority), and the god portrayed in the bible is a mad man (giving no moral authority).The author then suggests that Deism, a belief that god is everything and looking to nature as ones account of him, is more rational approach to defining god."},{"Title":"The age of reason: Being an investigation of true and fabulous theology","review":"In the Bible, some statements are literal, others are figures of speech. Therefore the various interpretations.Mr. Paine takes almost every statement in the Bible literally and then comes up with his criticisms. This has caused some to consider him an atheist. The book is primarily a critique of the Bible, but where he states his own views, he says that he believes in God and he hopes for happiness beyond this life. So he is not an atheist.His previous writings were of a political nature. When he decided to take on the Bible, he was moving out of his usual field, therefore his authority here is questionable."},{"Title":"The age of reason: Being an investigation of true and fabulous theology","review":"Paine writes a brief, cogent destruction of established religion, and appoints Creation as the true Word Of God.

Paine is a master at putting together the most logical reasoning. He compels an individual to think for himself.Many will find Paine's arguments about religion, Christianity and the other major religions disconcerting. He believed in God but not the god depicted in the Scriptures, not the god of the Isrelites, the god that slew the enemies of Isreal.He challenges the reader not to accept doctrine and dogma without exposing it to the application of reason. His arguments are powerful and not for the weak of heart.

Paine (and Allen), however, departed from the cautiously nuanced approach to religious issues adopted by his peers and vociferously rejected Judeo-Christian tenets and scriptures. In &quot;The Age of Reason,&quot; Paine outlines his objections to theism and his belief in deism, and he dissects the inconsistencies in both the Old and New Testaments.Paine published the book in two parts: the first he hurriedly finished in January 1794 when he realized he would be arrested during the French Revolution (passages were in fact written from the Luxembourg Palace in Paris, where he was imprisoned). The second part was written the following year, and he responds to the critics of the first part with a no-holds-barred attack on the veracity of the Bible.Paine presents his basic belief that &quot;it is only in the creation that all our ideas and conceptions of a word of God can unite,&quot; and later in the book he says that &quot;the creation is the bible of the deist.&quot; To Paine, the Bible is the word of man, not the Word of God, and he confronts many of the literalist beliefs proffered by the clergy and worshippers in his day. Many of his arguments, once shocking and blasphemous, are now taken for granted. For instance, he analyzes internal evidence in the books allegedly written by Moses, Joshua, and Samuel to show that it's impossible for Moses, Joshua, and Samuel to have written them--a view that most Christians and nearly all biblical scholars acknowledge today. In other ways, he is way ahead of his time, pondering the minuteness of our world in the immensity of the universe, speculating that other planets around other stars may well hold other intelligent species, and mocking the resulting conclusion that &quot;the Son of God . . . would have nothing else to do than to travel from world to world, in an endless succession of death.&quot;Paine believes that God made a complex multi-world universe (rather than a single world) so that it would serve as a textbook for humankind: &quot;As therefore the Creator made nothing in vain, so also must it be believed that he organized the structure of the universe in the most advantageous manner for the benefit of man.&quot; It is through this &quot;revelation&quot; of nature that believers can know God: &quot;The principles of science lead to this knowledge; for the creator of man is the creator of science, and it is through that medium that man can see God, as it were, face to face.&quot;Even if one disagrees with Paine (and many obviously do),&quot;The Age of Reason&quot; is an essential book both historically and philosophically. It should be read whether you hope to provide support for your own beliefs or to discover what non-Christians thought two centuries ago. It's inevitable that every reader will approach this book with an agenda, but even Christians should wrestle with Paine's arguments--since many of them are still heard today."},{"Title":"The age of reason: Being an investigation of true and fabulous theology","review":"It is evident to me that the staying power of Paine's Age of Reason is strong-- I need only look through the mixed opinions here at Amazon to see how dramatically it impacts those who read it. For me, it was a great wake-up call. I read Age of Reason at the beginning of this year and didn't know much about what to expect. From the first few pages I knew that I had found a book that reflects how I feel about religion. Paine offers a sensible alternative to atheism and the vast supply of revealed religions that abound in the world. To be logical, Paine points out, you need not give up a belief in a Higher Power. But you also don't have to sell your soul to charlatans and holy books written hundreds of years ago by men, not gods.The first half of Age of Reason outlines Paine's own beliefs as well as those he rejects. He gives reasons for every point he agrees or disagrees with and it is clear to the reader how Paine feels. Paine wants to spell out what his thoughts are so that he won't be misjudged by his peers. (Jefferson went through a similar ordeal-- because of his connections with France, he was labeled &quot;a French infidel and atheist&quot; neither of which was a true statement. See _The Religious Life of Thomas Jefferson_ for more info.)In the second half, Paine sets out to show the Biblical discrepancies to those who wanted to prove his ideas false by using the Bible as their &quot;evidence&quot;. In a relatively small number of pages, Paine debunks and demystifies (in my opinion) a fair amount of 'Christian' theology and scripture. If one man can do it so well in only a few pages, what does that say for revealed religion? That question is for each of us to answer individually and Age of Reason is required reading for anyone who is serious in doing just that."},{"Title":"The age of reason: Being an investigation of true and fabulous theology","review":"If the title above seems like hyperbole, I am prepared to defend it: Thomas Paine was one of the most important figures of the American revolution, his pamphlet &quot;Common Sense&quot; did more to bring the colonies to revolt than any other document. After the revolution he went to France believing the French revolution to be the next step in the development of the freedom of mankind. While there he was condemned to death by Robespierre and detained pending execution. Believing that his death was imminent, Paine wrote Part One of Age of Reason, which is a compelling critique of the Bible and the faults of Christianity. His analysis is thorough, detailed and compelling, which is particularly impressive since he did it entirely without access to a Bible! This topic will offend many (which explains Paine's current demise from the pantheon of revolutionary heroes) but it should be read both for its analysis of the Bible and for appreciation of one of America's founding fathers."},{"Title":"The age of reason: Being an investigation of true and fabulous theology","review":"\\"Of all the systems of religion that ever were invented, there is none more derogatory to the Almighty, more unedifying to man, more repugnant to reason, and more contradictory in itself, than this thing called Christianity.\\" [Age of Reason, conclusion chr.]This statement sums up beautifully what Paine set out to do with his iconoclastic Age of Reason. While we have good reason to believe that a good number of American revolutionaries were non-traditionalists about religion, Age of Reason leaves no doubt Paine's feelings towards Christianity. His goal with this book is to show why the religion of \\"revealed Christianity\\" should be abandoned.The first of two sections of AoR is devoted to showing how foolish the very belief in such ideas as revelations and miracles are - two things Christianity is premised on. Paine has a particular bone to pick with the idea of revelation. Something can only count as revelation, Paine says, to the person who directly recieves it. From there, it is only hearsay gotten second-hand. Thus, the Bible is not revelation, but hearsay. And miracles? Can they not be (a) things we don't understand yet; (b) mistakes in observation; or (c) lies, if we are told about them second-hand? There is no reason they cannot be any of these three.The second part of the book goes into exacting detail to show that the Bible was likely not written by those originally claimed as authors. Was there any of the Bible written by Moses? Exegesis gives reasons to reject this as absurd. Samuel? The same applies. And as we should well know, the New Testament was written much later than would have been necessary to have any first-hand knowledge of this man called Jesus.The secnod half, to be honest, may have been controversial at the time, but is hardly so now. Religious scholars seem on-board with the idea that the Bible and particularly the New Testament contain little if any first-hand accounts of anything.And that is what makes Paine so angry: that we are taking books with no confirmed authorship, and whose honesty may easily be doubted, as the revealed word of God. Paine is a deist who obstinately holds that the best way to know God is through nature - His Creation, if you will. If God created the universe, then why do we need a book to tell us about God when we can just look at that universe?To some - this author included - many of Paine's arguments will not be new. I've seen many of them elsewhere, from Bertrand Russell's \\"Why I'm Not a Christian,\\" to Sam Harris's \\"The End of Faith\\" to George Smith's \\"Atheism: Case AGainst God.\\" What makes Paine so special, though, is his rhetorical flair. Writing in an age where language was to be flowery and sentences were to be long, Paine writes in a remarkably terse and modern tone. He is obviously passionate about the subject and that makes for an exciting and invigorating read.For anyone who wants a better idea at one of the 'religous' currents in America circa 1800, this is an exciting book, right up there alongside fellow deist Thomas Jefferson's own \\"Jefferson's Bible.\\" And if you are a Christian who wants some food for thought, read this with... both eyes open."},{"Title":"The age of reason: Being an investigation of true and fabulous theology","review":"Thomas Paine believed in a creator. He saw all around him the evidence of a creator. Within himself, he felt the inspiration of a creator. But he was repulsed by what he read in the Bible. I am in full agreement with Mr. Paine that the god depicted in the Bible and the man-made systems of religion which claim divine inspiration for authority are an insult to the creator. This book, whether one would agree with its conclusions or not, at least will inspire the reader to think about the books and teachings to which men tell us to bow. Paine analyzes the logic of revealed religions with the critical thinking he was given and encourages us to do the same. And why shouldn't we? The fact is, most people I have met have thought more about what kind of car to buy than about their religion. They have taken the religion of their parents as mindlessly as they put on socks. And most organized religions don't push the issue as long as the tax-free money keeps coming in. Thomas Paine states clearly and unflinchingly the arguments against revealed religions. And Paine's writing stands the test of time without the need of apologetics."},{"Title":"The age of reason: Being an investigation of true and fabulous theology","review":"Tom Paine's excellent thought provoking book, The Age of Reason, did much to help me clear my mind of superstition and develope a much more realistic idea of the Creator.Paine shows there is a profound difference between &quot;revealed&quot; religion and God. He points out that all the different &quot;revealed&quot; religions have their own various &quot;holy&quot; books and all claim the other &quot;revealed&quot; religions and &quot;holy&quot; books are false.Deism is offered as an alternative to both &quot;revealed&quot; religion and atheism. Deism is a reason-friendly spiritual philosophy/religion that teaches belief in God based on reason and nature, not on any of the books written by men. It's a revolution in religion! It's spiritual, not dogmatic!Paine makes clear that if we want a better world WE NEED TO DO IT! We can't pray and dictate to God what needs to be done. We need to use our God-given reason and correct the problems we all face.The Age of Reason also makes clear that the best way to serve God is to serve our fellow human beings. Being kind to others is key to Deism.I'm very grateful to Tom Paine for having the courage to write this wonderful book. It has really helped change my life for the better. I'm now very active in the World Union of Deists and feel very postive about it!"},{"Title":"The age of reason: Being an investigation of true and fabulous theology","review":"This is the best book on freethinking that has walked the face of the earth. Many religious people say his arguments can be figured out by a three year old. Well, I have a rebuttal: Do we need to read the bible to know we shouldn't kill others? The more ironic thing, is that the religious conservatives know they have they basis for their claims, and when someone uses facts to prove them wrong, they can't handle it.Paine points out that the Catholic religion was more cruel than the Greek religions. The reason is because in Greek times, religious people welcomed philsophers and scientists. In the days of Christianity, the free thinkers and scientists were burned at the stake. The Age of Reason means you think outside of oppressive thinking, which generally happens to be religion. Sorry, that's a fact and you can read history to see that more people have had their lives and freedom taken away in the name of God than anything else. It still goes on today."},{"Title":"The age of reason: Being an investigation of true and fabulous theology","review":"I have been a freethinker for a year now, and I find the topic of religion as fascinating, especially now because I am not a part of it.I have read many books from various skeptical authors like Ingersoll, Doherty, Acharya S, Twain, and Barker. I always avoided Paine because I thought 1700's literature might be a little dry and difficult to read. I was also getting to the point where I wasn't really expecting to get any new insight or critique of christianity. I WAS WRONG. Even if you have lots of good skeptic books, buy this one for the following 3 reasons.1) Thomas Paine is a great writer! He is witty, humorous, and insightful. I only raised my eyebrow one or two times because of the language. (Shew = Shown btw)2)Thomas Paine did not have the benefit of carbon dating, and a lot of the biblical documentation that skeptics take for granted today. He critiques the bible using the bible itself. His critiquing of biblical history and authorship book by book is eye candy to any skeptic. For example:[If Moses wrote the pentatauch in third person then isn't] \\"Moses ridiculous and absurd: for example, Num 12:3 'now the man moses was very meek. Above all the men which were on the face of the earth' If Moses said this of himself then instead of being the meekest of men, he was one of the most vain and arragant coxcombs...If he was the author, the author is without credit, because to boast of meekness is the reverse of meekness, and is a lie in sediment.\\"Paine also uses clever internal dating techniques to show these documents were not written when they were supposed. How could Moses have known about the city of Dan (Gen 14) when its name wasn't changed (from Laish) until 331 years after his death (Judges 18). These little inconsistancies fill the second part of his book.3) This book, especially the first part, tells about the history of paine's unique life and times in which he lived (especially france) through his own words.Buy this book! If you like it, Buy any book by Robert Ingersoll they are all solid gold. I also recommend Dan Barker's \\"Losing Faith in Faith\\" for any beginning skeptic. Barker changed my life for the better.\\"Where freedom is, there is my home\\" -Ben franklin\\"Where freedom is not, there is mine\\" -Thomas Paine"},{"Title":"The age of reason: Being an investigation of true and fabulous theology","review":"Thomas Paine's book against Christianity is a classic to Free-thinkers for its revolutionary courage and thought. I loved it for the honest, simple, eloquent language Paine brought to the work, and the countless errors and absurdities he found both in the Bible and the Church orthodoxy. The author gave the reader his opinions on religion, but his opinions consisted of far more than simple statements about what he thought of the doctrines of the Church. He gave his reasoning behind his denial of the virgin birth and mosaic account, and each reasoning is a blow to the religion's reasonable contentions. His belief in Deism and therefore a belief in God may be categorized as showing faith, but many do not realize the politics attached to the work. He wanted to take power away from the Church hierarchy while leading others from reactionary athiesm (believing in no God because of the belief was corrupted by the Church). Also, athiesm was not a rational conclusion during this time period because Newtonian science showed an intelligent system to the universe. The best recommendation for this book comes from those who did not give it 5 stars. They obviously disagree with the book's conclusions in some way. The atheist or agnostic cannot get over the fact that he accepted a God who revealed himself through science. The Christian says he missed the &quot;true meaning&quot; of the religion. They both remain silent about the evidence Paine brings against the Bible because they know he is correct, and so do I."},{"Title":"The age of reason: Being an investigation of true and fabulous theology","review":"This is a book which was written in 1795 but surprisingly enough is as clear and easy to read as books written today. The book consists of two parts, the fist is a discussion of deism as a rational religious belief and he second part consists of a textual analysis of the bible.The second half is probably the more interesting part to read today. Payne goes through and compares the internal logic of the text of both the old and New Testament and Old Testament. The four gospels vary significantly in their account of a range of issues which Payne suggests proves that they were written in isolation from each other and suggests that their origin is hearsay. One example he raises is the account that suggests that when Jesus died the tombs of saints opened and they were returned to life. This rather significant event is not mentioned in the other gospels and that suggests that it was not true. He uses a similar approach to other gospels. In regard to the Old Testament he suggests convincingly that the suggestion that Moses wrote the first give books of the bible cannot be true. The key to understanding this is a close examination of the text. These books not only describe Moses life but also his death. The writing is inconsistent with personal authorship in other ways. (The text for instance suggesting that Moses was modest. If one was to make such an assertion about oneself it would not be consistent with the nature of the assertion)The book is very short and apart from the discussion of the bible it is an interesting work in the context of history. It was written after the revolution but before Napoleon proclaimed himself emperor. Payne had little idea of what was to come and how quickly Catholicism would be re-introduced in France. An interesting book and the critique of the Bible is one of the foundations of modern scholarship in the area."},{"Title":"The age of reason: Being an investigation of true and fabulous theology","review":"This is a wonderful book. I wish I would have read it earlier in my life. In the Age of Reason Paine is trying to free human thought from the bondage of Organized religion's scare tactics and superstition. Think what the world would be like today if we were Deist and quit arguing and killing over religous text. Paine's arguments are well organized and easy to read. I also believe this book should be taught in schools. I strongly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The age of reason: Being an investigation of true and fabulous theology","review":"This is an excellent book, very analytical and exacting. It'll open the eyes of many good Christians, if they will only open their minds to the truth. I strongly recommend this book to anyone that's interested in the truth about the Bible."},{"Title":"The age of reason: Being an investigation of true and fabulous theology","review":"Wow. That is how I felt after just a page or two. Here was someone who had deep faith (like myself) explaining in a clear and intelligent manner all the questions I have had since I was five years old (the age of reason! ) about the christian religion. If you have ever questioned why Moses, a supposed &quot;man of God&quot; - ordered his troops to &quot;kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman that hath known a man by lying with him; but all the women-children, that have not known a man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves,&quot; and other acts of violence, murder and mass murder are upheld as &quot;The Word Of God&quot; in this culture, this book will help you sort it out. Paine's words ring so true: &quot;what can be greater blasphemy than to ascribe the wickedness of man to the orders of the Almighty?&quot; Have you ever wondered why Christianity holds that great men and woman of faith, produced by different cultures through history, who inspire us with their good lives and great devotion to God, must, according to scripture, burn in hell, because they were not Christians? Whomever said, &quot;All great men are the same religion&quot; was of the same mind as Paine. Whatever faith you are (I happen to be a pagan) if you have deep faith but cannot shut out common sense, logic, justice and reason, you will share this man's faith. For me, as a pagan, I understood Paine's idea that the only True Word of God is creation, not one of the hundreds of man's written mythologies from around the world. He points out beautifully how creation itself, in all its beauty and savage intensity, shows the face of God far better than the flawed and violent history of the Jewish race. A blade of grass, he points out, cannot be altered or mistranslated, etc. Thomas writes: To charge the commission of the acts upon the Almighty, which, in their own nature, and by every rule of moral justice, are crimes, as all assassination is, and more especially the assassination of infants, is matter of serious concern. The Bible tells us, that those assassinations were done by express command of God. To believe, therefore, the Bible to be true, we must unbelieve all our belief in the moral justice of God; for werein could crying or smiling infants offend? And to read the bible without horror, we must undo everything that is tender, sympathizing, and benevolent in the heart of man.&quot; I think this book explains well why so much killing has been done in the name of Christianity. If you have an open mind - if you are interested in hard questions that are not easy to face if you ascribe to the Christian faith - if you know in your heart that the &quot;Word of God&quot; is more than the rules and history of a violent middle eastern people, and if you have felt that &quot;God&quot; is far to wonderous to be as petty and confusing as Christianity makes him/her/it out to be, then you will love this book. Read it!"},{"Title":"The age of reason: Being an investigation of true and fabulous theology","review":"It discusses his beliefs in which he thinks the New and Old Testament are not true because it is from here say, which is the word of man and not the Word of God. He wonders how people can believe something written in a text and not something that was personally told to them. His biggest argument was how we can believe in something we have never seen. This is a good book to read because it explains many beliefs and misunderstandings that you may have about the bible and of various religions."},{"Title":"The age of reason: Being an investigation of true and fabulous theology","review":"Thomas Paine's Age of Reason was intended to spark a revolution in the world of religion in the same way that Common Sense helped fuel the political Revolution in America. They are both written very plainly and are wildly accessible to most readers. The big difference was that Paine's posturing in Common Sense reflected (or at least tapped into) the sentiments of the average colonist. On the other hand, the personal honesty of Age of Reason did not appear right for this planet.Were the Age of Reason an essay about deism, it would harldly be notable. Paines asserts his deist beliefs in the first few pages, spends no time justifying them or arguing their merit and gets right to the primary thrust of the work: assaulting the Bible and what is sometimes called \\"organized\\" religion. The shock level of Paine's work can be easily gauged by considering the shock level that it generates in the typical reader today. The fire simply leaps from the pages! I guarantee it. Open it anywhere. Start reading. See what happens.Some of Paine's criticism are downright silly on their face - like complaining that one verse suggests it was \\"dark\\" and another suggests it was \\"morning\\" (as if it could not be both). But others are altogether amusing. The differences in the Gospels, for example, are often attributed to the fact that different authors are likely to remember - and emphasize - different things. There is sense enough to that. But only one Gospel mentions graves opening and dead people walking around in the streets after the Crucifixion. Paine humorously guesses that such an incident should probably have been remembered by more than just one writer. Age of Reason is full of fury, but it does provide a few good chuckles like that along the way.Whereas Common Sense calls for specific steps to aid in the political Revolution, Age of Reason does not outline a path for the future. As a result, it can leave readers with a sense that Paine was simply rambling, albeit in his usually entertaining way.Having written all of that, I must write this: It is certain that many Christians would be deeply offended reading Age of Reason. While I understand and respect that, my personal view is that this work has as much potential to make strong believers as it does to push readers in other directions. On top of all that, I think it is sobering (and perhaps useful) to observe that Paine, who, for the most part, rejected the Scripture, appeared to have far more interest in it, and far more knowlegde of it, than the average Christian today. Indeed, it would be my guess that most of the irritation and annoyance that this book would cause in a believer today would be the direct by-product of an inability to \\"give an answer\\" for the \\"hope\\" that lies within them."},{"Title":"The age of reason: Being an investigation of true and fabulous theology","review":"Paine, who questioned the authority of kings and established the greatest country on earth, now investigates the authroity of priests, churches and scriptures. His simple but powerful premise is, that if God speaks to me it is revelation; but if you tell me He spoke to you, your assertion is heresay. Hence all scriptures of the world religions are also heresay. The only revelation he heard was what he could see--nature.His space-age insight that since there are many worlds, and life is likely on more than ours, an effective savior would have to hop from planet to planet sacraficing himself for fallen man or fallen aliens is hysterical and brilliant.This book is very unique, because Paine, unlike his contemporaries who shared his views (e.g. Jefferson, Franklin and Washington) dared not speak them. Even outspoken Paine waited until he neared execution before exploring the limits of religion from the vantage point of age in prison.His courage and effort have brought me a great deal of comfort. His methods show me how to analyze current issues in religion, morality and politics. He gives me a better yardstick with which to measure morality, churches and human behavior. Both tumbs up."},{"Title":"The age of reason: Being an investigation of true and fabulous theology","review":"For the first time in my life, I realized how often I had allowed others to tell me what I believed. Few books have ever had such an incredible impact on my life. Am I still a Christian? Yes. I am grateful for Thomas Paine for turning my blind faith, into a faith with my eyes wide open."},{"Title":"The age of reason: Being an investigation of true and fabulous theology","review":"Paine does an excellent job debunking many of the spurious claims found in the bible. He also clearly shows the many similarities between Christianity and pagan mythology. Many believers in the bible do not follow every tenent or believe in every story as it is told i.e. Adam &amp; Eve, Noah, etc. Do most Christians really believe it is a good idea to &quot;turn the other cheek&quot;? The light of reason causes most people to at least wonder about these philosophies and stories. This is in essence what Paine does in this book. In the end, the Bible does not stand up to reason.It is interesting to note that despite all the criticism towards Paine from religious people, today and in the past, he was one of the first and most influential abolitionists in America - in a time when many religious Christians owned slaves or felt it was justifiable through the bible!"},{"Title":"The age of reason: Being an investigation of true and fabulous theology","review":"We could use this American forefather in our Age Of Emotion, but he would never find a publisher and if he did people wouldn't read what they don't want to hear. Paine is direct, factual and relentless. Even in this short book his condemnation of scriptural religion becomes tedious in his effort to be complete. To Paine, scriptural religions - Judaism, Christianity and Islam - are the study of \\"opinions and fancies of men\\" confusing the message of God, which he says, is to be found in nature, available to all, unhindered by translations, rewritings and Church censorship.His knowledge of ancient mythologies and understanding of how the early Church evolved as a direct overlay of the Roman Empire with assumption of the Roman pantheon as Saints of the Church is impressive for 1794. He precedes our modern day Dominic Crossan by 200 years when he reports there was nothing new in virgin births or miracles in the ancient world - a common occurrence. To believe such events as resurrection from the dead Paine finds no different from any other superstition. To Paine Jesus was a heroic figure, peerless among men, but a man all the same, made into a God by those who loved him.Part 1 is concerned with the unreasonable like prophesy, which he shows to be hindsight not prediction. Likewise, Biblical moral conflicts of human sacrifice: \\"If I owe a person money and cannot pay him\\", writes Paine, someone else could assume the debt for payment, averting debtor's prison. But \\"if I commit a crime... moral justice cannot take the innocent for the guilty, even if the innocent would offer itself.\\" Part 2 is concerned with inconsistencies or impossibilities in the Bible itself. Like Moses writing of his own death, or the city of Dan which did not exist until 331 years after the Bible says Moses died; God's promise to save king Ahaz from Assyrians in Isaiah, while God slaughters him with Assyrians in Chronicles. The list is long, suitable for critiques, but tiring. Paine can also be amusing. Reviewing the Garden he notes the snake \\"enters into familiar conversation with Eve, who is in no way surprised to hear a snake talk.\\" With these complications, and a list of reason violations, Paine writes that scriptures are \\"atheistic blasphemy\\". If you want to know God, he says, learn science as it is the true theology, revealing God all around us.Reading scriptures literally, as we do today, Paine reveals the obvious. But if Joseph Campbell's mythological tips are accessed we can see more to the stories than simply God's murder of innocent first born or his too-human characteristics of jealousy and revenge. Though it may be hard to see past the carnage of scriptures there remains a mystical element, like art, communicating past the painful present, penetrating the mystery of being alive and having to die, written by people without our clutter and with time to think about such things."},{"Title":"The age of reason: Being an investigation of true and fabulous theology","review":"This book is one of my all-time favorites. It has helped me feel better about being an agnostic. When I confront Christian friends with the arguments Paine raises, they never are able to give a solid answer. This is without exception.The amazing thing to me is that Paine wrote this before Darwin, before the space age, at a time (around 1800) when it was almost unthinkable to attack the Church. It shows that Paine had guts, as well as an abundance of brains."},{"Title":"The age of reason: Being an investigation of true and fabulous theology","review":"To be honest, I was disappointed by this book in many ways. I don't know whether his other writings were in the same style, and I didn't notice, or if it's just in this book, but he seems like he's trying to impress his reader with his grammar. Unfortunately, like so many people who use this tactic, he simply ends up looking ignorant. For example, at the end of the first paragraph in the Preface of the second part, he writes, \\" ...that the same danger was approaching myself.\\" I have to admit, these sort of mistakes are the most annoying to me, but it's still inexcusable to use that sort of language to impress readers.As he admits in the second part, he didn't have a copy of the Bible with him at the time he wrote. He seems to only try to shoot down Christianity, regardless of the actual merits of his accusations. For example, in the first part, he discusses the word \\"prophesy\\" meaning simply making poetry and uses a passage from Samuel about Saul to prove this point. Upon hearing this, I immediately looked into our Oxford English dictionary for its roots. Well, it turned out that poetry and prophesy did at one time mean the same thing, but the Greek \\"prophet\\" was one who directly spoke to God, so the common interpretation is correct. Paine, while he could certainly have researched this and definitely saw the need to, simply relied on the reader to take his word for it.After I've said all of this, Paine, when not dealing with specific facts trying to denounce Christianity, certainly makes some very valid points, especially about the Bible being the perfect Word of God and Faith. His language and reasoning, in most parts, is certainly as passionate and persuasive as in his other works. If you're looking for some argument material to dispute your Christian buddy, definitely look here, but if you're looking for the truth, you may want to seek it somewhere else or take this with a grain of salt as far as the factual basis for some of his attacks on Christianity go."},{"Title":"The age of reason: Being an investigation of true and fabulous theology","review":"Paine who failed out of school at the age of 12 was not one of the best thinkers of all time. He joined the American Revoluntion immediately prior to its onset, and he met with the founding fathers and expressed the ideas of the American people of the time in Common Sense. Because of the fame he received from Common Sense he attempted to influence Christian nation he was living in. Although some of the other founding fathers were also deist, Paine's writtings in the Age of Reason (which contradicts his earlier statements)lead to his downfall. He attempted to take advantage of his limited fame and failed.Some of Paine's arguments state that he can't accept the revelations of others because he cannot be assured of THEIR credibility. This comes from a man that failed out of school at 12 years old, failed at every job he attempted, and is only remembered for his statements in support of the American Revolution, which he only was apart of for a few years before it took place.Much of Paine's arguments contain fallacies. His belief of an Age of Reason is not supported by logical or reasoning abilities. One example is the logical fallacy Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc (after this therefore because of this). One of Paine's arguments is that Satan was punished by being sent to a pit; Paine then states that the Greek god Jupiter punished his opponent (giants) by confining one under a mountain (Paine claims resulted in volcanoes). Paine claims that BECAUSE the legend of Jupiter imprisoning his rival allegedly preceded the concept of Satan being imprisoned that the Christian belief in Satan must have been derived out of the Jupiter legend. Paine's assumption excludes the fact that earthy crimes committed throughout all ages have had punishment or prison associated with them, and the claim that the Jews would have had to study Greek mythology to create their own beliefs is a complete hypothesis on Paine's part.Paine's statements are wishy-washy to say the least. He makes statements that the Bible is only hearsay and has no merit, and then at other times makes statements based on Biblical passages as though they were a matter of fact. He states that Jesus was a great teacher, and that he (Paine) is going to stick with the philosophy of Thomas (doubting Thomas) and demand to see proof of everything. If Paine's theories were true that the Bible was only hearsay, he would have no way of judging what Jesus taught as his (Paine's) beliefs do not allow for Jesus or Thomas to have even existed.A very interesting thing to note about Paine's beliefs is that if you apply his beliefs to his own work then you would PROVE in Paine's view point that HE never existed. Paine states that you cannot believe that Paul wrote the books of the New Testament attributed to him therefore the Bible is not true. This same principle can be applied to Paine's work to challenge Paine's very existence. None of us personally met Paine or verified that his writings were his own; we only have writings that we are told were written by Thomas Paine by others, and that the writings contained Paine's beliefs. If you apply this type of reasoning to Paine's own work then you would have to conclude that Paine's work might be a complete fabrication, and that there is no proof that he even lived that does not come from hearsay or documentation of other men.In LIFE AND WRITINGS OF THOMAS PAINE it says: \\"Deism teaches us that God is a God of truth and justice. Does the Bible teach the same doctrine? It does not.\\"This concept of God being a God of Justice and Truth is taken from the Revelations of the Bible and not from the Deist's use of Reason. By simply observing Creation to understand God as Deist claims you would not come to the understanding of God as a God of Justice and Truth. The world is not naturally just. If you base your religion on observing nature you are more likely to conclude that God is growing people in order to eat them, as that is what is observable in nature. Human's raise animals for food and are not concerned about providing the animals with truth and justice. These traits cannot be determined by observing the movements of the sun or the actions of man.Observing the nature of man; to rob, rape, and kill would appear to be a natural state of man, as these actions have been recorded throughout all history and still exist today. If Deists hold to the belief of judging God by observing the creation without giving any thought to Biblical Revelation then there is not cause to label such actions as sin. Revealed religion is what labels these instincts as sin. Paine's view originates in his Quaker up bringing, which he then perverts and intermixes with his concept of Reason to make up his odd belief and questionable belief system.Paine also rests some of his arguments on the new definition that he gives to the word Revelation. He redefines the word to meet his desires. The problem with this argument is that when debating the usage of a word relating to a topic thousands of years earlier it is necessary to use the definition of word at that time. By changing the definition of the word thousands of years later you do not invalidate how it has been used for centuries. This argument is also a logical fallacy called the Straw man in which Paine creates his own new definition of the word and argues against his own definition and not the actual topic.Much of Paine's view on Reason comes from ethnocentric thinking that He (educated to the level of a 12 year old boy) has a superior ability to think than those who have lived in the past. Paine views himself as an enlightened thinker when in fact the opposite is true. He values the usage of Reason in gaining wisdom, but the Reason that Deism promotes is ignorance. It involves a lack of study or research, and is simply the concept of \\"Believe whatever you reason without considering anything other than your own opinions\\", and leaves man to his own devices. The problem is that the Bible documents the results of man being left to his own devices, and if REASON were really being applied then an enlightened thinker would STUDY and learn from the mistakes of those of the past to prevent themselves from falling into the same snares.There is nothing enlightened about reasoning through ignorance. Much of Paine's problems with Christianity are not actually with the Word of God (as Paine claims they are), but are against man's hypocrisy and use of religion wrongfully. The Bible is also against these things, so Paine's attacks on the Bible are misdirected. Paine's argument that Christianity is wrong simple because other religions exist is foolish. One would not assume that all foods are poisonous simply because some of them are. If you do not want to eat poisonous food the answer does not lie in blindly making up your own recipes and biting into them hoping you wouldn't die, but lies in studying the good and bad recipes to determine where the poison is in order to use the correct recipe that will allow you to live; that is how REASON is to be used intelligently. If you are an enlightened thinker then you would analyze, evaluate, contemplate, understand, and reason to determine the truth. Making up your own philosophy based on what feels good to you is not enlightenment, and it is not even a new way of thinking; this error is commonly documented in the Bible.Paine's arguments show only a superficial understanding of the Bible. If he were to put effort into studying the Bible and applying reason to it then his questions and objections to it would be answered. He would also be able to answer why some religions are false ones and why they are so. As it is Paine argues that all religion say they are right and since they all cannot be right Paine assumes that none of them can be right. This is another error in his reasoning. Certainly there are an infinite number of examples of people doing things wrong, but someone else being capable of doing it right."},{"Title":"The age of reason: Being an investigation of true and fabulous theology","review":"By all means read this book, if you want to hear the skeptical side, but dont take it seriously. Paine argues that since the bible was given to us he has no knowledge of that personally and thus has no reason to accept it as being true. Obviously Paine cant believe anything anyone tells him. After all, why stop at the bible? He then argues about the supposed contradictions in Genesis. One that comes to mind, is that he claims that light was created before the sun, and hence is a contradiction. But the bible does not mention that the light was from the sun, it simply said there was a light. Which could have been Gods presence. All his other arguments can all be easily refuted, by anyone who has even a little knowledge of theology. He then claims that the God of the bible doesnt exist, but he replaces him with the deistic God. This God has all the great attributes except knowledge. Is there anything more ridiculous? God is perfect being. He cannot be lacking in any perfection, least of all knowledge. This book is a glaring example of the authors ignorance. However, what is even more shocking is the high reviews this book has received."},{"Title":"The age of reason: Being an investigation of true and fabulous theology","review":"I found Thomas Paine to be an interesting study on the road to a lifelong exploration of our founding fathers. It was in fact many of his ideas of governance that laid the foundation for our founding documents, at least those presented in his pamphlets &quot;Common Sense&quot; and &quot;The Rights of Man&quot;. I read the other pamphlets and decided as he did to make this my last before moving on to other greater minds.Unlike most self-proclaimed scholars today who only read, study or quote the traditional 10 or 15 founders. I am fully aware that there are some 250 - 300 actual founders both men and women, who must be considered to get a true feel for the great history of the American birth.Of coarse they are purposely obscured by the left to move their hedonistic agendas forward. In fact there are many other great contributors and minds listed in books like &quot;America's God and Country&quot; by William Federer. Or &quot;Original Intent&quot; by David Barton as well as &quot;Our Sacred Honor&quot; by William Bennett who lived prior to, during and after the Independence and Constitution era, who had even more profound philosophies that significantly helped to shape those 250 plus and their decendents thoughts.After completing this book just one in a series of Thomas Paine Pamphlets. I realized that although most of our founding intellectuals, at least the vast majority of them, were kindred spirits in moral, ethical and ideological attitudes with my own and the vast majority of Americans. Yet there were some like Paine however, that I would have definite disagreements with, if we were to have a sit down discussion back then or even today.Paine was so filled with the spirit of Independence, freedom, liberty, representative government, self-proclaimed reason and affection for his own personal idea of God, that it is very difficult at first to understand the overwhelming intolerance, self-centeredness and near psychotic hatred of the Word of God. Hate is the only word that adequately describes his view of Biblical matters, and that is perhaps why I found this book an embarrassment to his obvious intellect in other areas.In all his other pamphlets I find a profound wisdom and intellectual nature. A nature that seems to drain from him, as if he had slashed his own wrist in writing this book, and let his brilliance seep out with his blood, due to his rigid and unrelenting attempt to discredit both the old and new testaments.The comments on the back of the book pretty much sum up his ridiculous attack, but give the researcher a good look into the mind of some of the modern day anti-religion extremist of the liberal left thinking icons in the Democrat Party.Yet I did not do what most, I assume do, as did many of the original founders when they got into his ranting and raving about time, names, events and verbiage. Which was to throw the book down and ridicule his reasoning.Instead I stayed the course and remained engaged and found it and him fascinating. To see a man of such intellect on other political matters betray some of his own principles and concepts were intriguing to say the least. For instance he would marvel and preach the power, omnipotence, unquestioned ability and worthiness of praise of his vision of God. Yet in the next paragraph or chapter begin to put rules, regulations and restrictions upon that all-powerful God he had just created, because of some Biblical tale he wanted to debunk.That was very odd for a man of such care in journalistic, political and intellectual acumen in previous works. In any case for the strong of heart and faith, this is still an important read to understand the history of America and our founders.My faith was in fact not shaken a smidgen after finishing it. I actually found that it was even more strongly reinforced than before and after this I am pretty sure my faith will be able to withstand just about any attack. His logic is just plain flawed and only those dupted by a fanatic loyalty to Paine would be gullible enough to buy it hook, line and sinker.I actually found myself slightly laughing at his onslaught as if he were a child throwing a tantrum and holding his breath in his anger &quot;until he died&quot; as many children threaten. I just waited for him to fall over faint from ranting and then start breathing again. My faith perfectly in tact and dismissing this misguided work as one giant brain fart, by an otherwise great man."},{"Title":"The age of reason: Being an investigation of true and fabulous theology","review":"After all I'd heard about Thomas Paine, and after all the quotes I'd read against Christianity from his book, I had always assumed that Paine was an atheist, or at least agnostic. But when I picked up this book I was surprised to discover that he was a Deist. (On the first page he writes: &quot;I believe in one God, and no more; and I hope for happiness beyond this life.&quot;) So I read with interest exactly what Paine's famous 'reason'able views were, and why so many people hailed him as such a hero. But it soon became apparent that his views and conclusions weren't very reasonable at all, and many of his arguments can be easily refuted.Firstly, Paine's views about his Deity's 'Scripture' are far from reasonable. Paine says he does not believe the Bible is the Word of God because it was written by man, and it could have been altered or counterfeited. He then tells us what he DOES believe to be the word of God. He writes: &quot;Do we want to know what God is? Search not the book called the Scripture, which any human hand might make, but the Scripture called the creation ... which no human invention can counterfeit or alter&quot;. Okay, let's read some pages from Paines' Scripture called creation. What do we see? Suffering, cancer, disease, pain, starvation, earthquakes. We can obviously see that Paine's Deity is a sadist, or even evil. But Paine holds that his Deity is good. I can also see nothing in Paine's Scripture which tells us whether there is one, or many Creators, or whether Their intentions were to create good or evil. There is also nothing in his Scripture which promises &quot;happiness beyond this life&quot; which Paine so hoped for, (and I pray to God that he got it).I have just illustrated that Paine's Scripture can be as equally altered or misread as the Bible, and its message to mankind is even more fallible than the message in the Christian's Word of God. It is through FATH that Christians believe the Bible is the Word of God. As it happens, the Bible completely acknowledges the fallenness of Creation, and it also reveals insights into why suffering exists in creation. The reasons for 'suffering' in Creation can be found in the Bible's view of a self-limiting God, (the divine &quot;self-giving&quot; is central to the Christian faith). An infinite Love will not manipulate the beloved, (in this case, Creation), and from the Christian perspective, God's omnipotence is understood as God's capacity to enter into love with all its costs. So just as God cannot create square circles, He also cannot prevent 'pain' from being a consequence of self-giving Love.Paine spends a lot of time reflecting on the dogma of the Church, and he concludes that there is no 'spirit' to Christianity. Nothing could be further from the truth. Paine ought to have been aware that the Church was originally founded as a man-made framework in order to 'embrace' the Spirit of God in such a way for man to be able to focus in an ordered, disciplined manner. However, over the years, due to OVER-discipline, and due to egotistical, narrow-minded fundamentalists, the focus has gradually shifted from the Spirit to the framework and regulations itself. Paine seems completely unaware that the heart of Christianity resides way deeper than the framework itself. The dogma is no more spiritual, vital or alive than a mud brick - and can be equally as damaging as having the said mud brick shoved in one's face. It is the Spirit of God that the heart of Christianity focuses upon.Paine's arguments against the validity of the four gospels are negligible. If four different people sat at four different sides of a football stadium, and watched exactly the same event, and then wrote an essay on the event 70 years later, then I would expect to find a number of minor contradictions in the four essays - even though the event was completely true. As it happens, the core elements of all four gospels complement each other. Where is the problem? Paine wilfully invents problems where there are none. It is through spiritual FAITH that a person accepts the Christ event as true, for it is certainly not possible for a Christian to scientifically prove the event, just as a scientist cannot disprove it.To conclude, while reading 'The Age of Reason', it struck me that Paine's views aren't very 'reasonable' at all. Quite the contrary.Jesus Christ - He's a righteous dude."},{"Title":"The age of reason: Being an investigation of true and fabulous theology","review":"I was challenged to read this by a friend and thought it would bring up some intersting questions to debate. I was hugely disappointed with the quality of Paine's arguments. It was written before the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls and without the benefit of modern scholarship, so the arguments are antiquated. It is more of a rant than a scholarly essay on reason. It's probably something people should read simply because Paine is so well-respected, but I recommend something by William Lane Craig instead."},{"Title":"The age of reason: Being an investigation of true and fabulous theology","review":"I feel that many of Paine's comments and conclusions in 'The Age of Reason' are irrational, and are quite UN-reasonable. One such example is Paine's refutation of the four gospels. He highlights the cosmetic contradictions that exist in the gospels and concludes: &quot;The disagreement of the parts of a story PROVES the whole cannot be true.&quot;This assertion is completely false, and his case against the gospels is far from convincing. Think about it logically. If you were to take a significant event, and were to take four different people who KNEW the event were true, and then asked them to write a separate account 70 years after the event occurred, then it would be EXPECTED to find cosmetic contradictions in the four accounts. Paine spends his time nit-picking the cosmetic contradictions and then concludes that the event must have been false. Paine seems completely oblivious to the fact that the underlying message in the gospels is undeniable.Do any of the gospels assert that Jesus was not resurrected from the dead? Do any of the gospels claim that Jesus did not perform miracles? Do any of the gospels deny Jesus' deity? It is this underlying message that Christians have faith in.One event which Paine highlights as &quot;proof&quot; that the gospels cannot be true, was the account from Matthew 27.51 which the other gospels omit: &quot;The earth did quake, and the rocks rent, and the graves were opened, and many bodies of the saints which slept arose, and came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went into the holy city and appeared unto many.&quot;Paine then says &quot;Had it been true, it would have filled up whole chapters of those books, and been the chosen theme and general chorus of all the writers. ... The writer of the book of Matthew should have told us who the saints were that came to life again and went into the city, and what became of them afterward.&quot;Here, Paine completely misunderstands the nature of the gospels, and he reads these words from Matthew as scientific literalism. There are many paragraphs in the Bible which contain profound spiritual truths and should not be taken literally. See, for instance, Matthew 10.34, when Jesus says, &quot;I did not come to bring peace, but a sword.&quot; St. Paul is influenced by Jesus' spiritual terminology in Ephesians 6.11 when he says, &quot;Put on all the armour that God gives you so that you will be able to stand up against the Devil's evil tricks.&quot; ... &quot;Accept salvation as a helmet and the Word of God as the SWORD which the Spirit gives you. Do all this in prayer.&quot;So if Paine were to continue his line of &quot;rational&quot; analysis of the gospels, then he ought to have pages asking question such as: &quot;Why didn't the writer of Matthew describe the type of metal which formed the sword?&quot;, or &quot;How much flour and water was used in the bread which Jesus referred to as his 'body'?&quot;, or &quot;Why didn't John say whether he meant a bed-side lamp or a candle light when he said that the Word is the 'light that shines on all mankind'?&quot;It is clear that Matthew's words that &quot;the saints which slept arose ... and went into the holy city&quot; is referring to a profound spiritual event, rather than a literal, physical event.In Luke 17.21 Jesus says &quot;The Kingdom of God does not come visibly. No one will say 'Look, here it is!' or, 'There it is!'; because the Kingdom of God is within you&quot;. What would Paine's 'rational' analysis have been? &quot;Was Jesus referring to my liver, or the chicken I ate yesterday?&quot;More importantly, this quote from Luke undermines Paine's argument that Jesus was wrong when he prophesied that the Kingdom of God would come within the life-time of the people he was addressing - a popular argument from atheists.The main problem about Paines' (and many other atheists) refutations of the Bible stems from their refusal to break out of literalism. The inherent nature of the Bible is deep and it reveals spiritual truths which shouldn't be read as scientific, literal accounts.Paine then highlights the apparent 'contradiction' in the OT and NT's view of God, and he continues to scoff at Christians who believe the Bible is the word of God. He asks why the God of the Old Testament would encourage the extermination and massacre of whole nations, while the God of the New Testament preaches love, harmony and forgiveness?Here is my answer:Just as the history of mankind reveals a history of evolution, so does the Bible reveal an evolutionary UNDERSTANDING of the nature of God, according to the people's capacity and insight - until the fullness of God's revelation in Jesus Christ.In this sense, the Bible is not so much a contradiction of two opposing views of God, but rather the emergence of an evolving understanding of His very nature. God remains the same - man's insights have progressed.This evolutionary trend is apparent throughout the Bible. Moses' reaction to the people's harsh attitude of the day (i.e. a 'life for an eye' and 'life for a tooth'), was that of &quot;an eye for an eye ... a tooth for a tooth.&quot; Jesus says in Matthew 5.38: &quot;You have heard that it was said, 'An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.' But now I tell you: do not take revenge on someone who wrongs you.&quot;Christians do not hold that the Bible was written directly by God in magical, spiritual ink. Instead they freely acknowledge the 'humanness' of the prophets and the writers of the Bible. Therefore it comes as no surprise that the Bible is fallible. The Bible was inspired by God in the sense that it contains central issues of wisdom and spiritual insights about the Plans of God and about the nature of God.To me, Paine's attempts to undermine Christianity ring hollow."},{"Title":"The age of reason: Being an investigation of true and fabulous theology","review":"If anyone sincerely thinks that Christianity can be undermined with a dated pile of poop like Paine's effort here, then it's time people started wizening up to reality.The weakest argument I have ever heard is the argument against &quot;faith&quot;. Faith is inherent to the human condition. The only way anybody would have a faith-free understanding is to be infallible - to know everything, which is a characteristic given only to God.Christians believe in Christ, not on account of any authority, but because He Himself instils such faith in us. True faith is when someone finds something deep, and experiences it as being REAL. If another has not searched for or discovered it, or has not experienced it, then so be it. But there is nothing more closed-minded or dogmatic than to assert that the Christian faith is &quot;wrong&quot;.&quot;In the beginning was the Word&quot;. If you believe &quot;In the beginning was 'nothing'&quot; then that is your faith. If you believe &quot;The Universe just IS&quot; then that is your faith.Jesus Christ just IS. That is the Christian faith. If God, who exists beyond the framework of science itself, dwelt within Jesus Christ 2000 years ago as an act of the ultimate sacrifice of all time, then would you really expect a scientist to come and prove it?The quote &quot;If we cannot accept the Bible, then we cannot accept Christainity&quot; is one of the most narrow minded assertions I've ever heard. Who cannot accept the Bible? Thomas Paine? Just because Paine cannot accept the Bible means Christianity is debunked? If anyone doesn't understand the Bible, then it's Paine.He takes figures of speeches' literally, he reads deep spiritual themes as if it were a physician's text book; he chalks up numerous passages as &quot;contradictions&quot; as much as he would say a parent is self-contradictory for allowing a child to eat with his fingers while demanding an older child to use a fork and spoon.Should we be expected to rely on the authority of skeptics and the likes of people who deny the necessity of 'faith', when the matter concerns the source from which believers are to draw the truth for their lives?Let's start getting real. Let's start growing up in faith. And as for little Tommy Paine?

If men are so wicked with religion, what would they be without it?&quot;Samuel Adams wrote to Paine that his book was &quot;repugnant to the true interest of so great a part of the citizens of the United States.&quot;President John Adams wrote, &quot;The Christian religion is . . . the religion of wisdom, virtue, equity and humanity, let the Blackguard [scoundrel] Paine say what he will.&quot;Benjamin Rush said Paine's book was &quot;absurd.&quot;President John Quincy Adams said that in view of this book &quot;Mr. Paine has departed altogether from the principles of the Revolution.&quot;Patrick Henry called it &quot;the puny efforts of Paine.&quot;John Jay, the first Chief Justice of the US Supreme Court, wrote, &quot;As to The Age of Reason, it never appeared to me to have been written from a disinterested love of truth or of mankind.&quot;The Founding Fathers rejected what Paine wrote in this book.

I was disappointed with this book as Paine states that Jesus Christ was \\"a virtuous and amiable man\\" and that he sees no reason for not believing that people like Mary, Joseph and Jesus existed. Where did Paine get his info that Jesus was virtuous and amiable? He doesn't say. He provides nothing in the way of evidence to support the notion that Jesus Christ was a real person.At least he points out the purpose of religion: to terrify and enslave mankind. I think he wastes too much time on the absurdities of that tedious and unpleasant book, the old testament. In fact, in one footnote he admits that the old testament is \\"too ridiculous for criticism\\". So why waste so much time on it?I found the letters to Samuel Adams at the back of the book more interesting and perhaps he could have covered some of the topics of these in his book, e.g. the act of prayer as an abomination that indicates that the person who prays is the sort of person who either distrusts God or who wishes to dictate to him.Overall, not bad."},{"Title":"The age of reason: Being an investigation of true and fabulous theology","review":"Paine was right on then in the context of his time.

It doesn't say God just created light. That preceeds the verse when God said that he seperated the light from darkness with that light.Any open-minded person would realize that. Then, later in Genesis 1:14-19, it seems as if God repeats himself. The easiest explanation for this is that he/she/it doesn't exist.

I personally feel that Paine's attitudes were primarily a reaction against Christian fundamentalism and dogma, and it is clear that Paine failed to appreciate that the true spirit of Christianity resides far deeper than the dogmatic framework of fundamentalism and regulations.At the time this book was written (in the 1700's), Christian fundamentalism and its narrow minded message of eternal damnation for all non-Christians, was promulgated at a far more extreme level than it is today. Of course, there are still fundamentalists today, but I feel many Christians are waking up to the fact that dogma, Biblical literalism, and narrow minded regulations are far from what the true spirit of Christianity is all about.In the 1700's, it was asserted by almost all Christians that every other world religion was &quot;wrong&quot;, and that all non-Christians would spend an eternity without God - even though I feel that many of these fundamentalists had failed to find any kind of spiritual peace in their dogma in the first place. Contrary to what Paine believed back then, I feel many religious folk who know anything about spirituality happily accept that all religions are in touch with the same thing - the Word - or whatever other label we may choose to call Him. Christians (such as myself) believe that God made the ultimate divine revelation through Jesus Christ, even though many Christians do not believe that Christianity is the ONLY path to God. Rather, they believe that the WORD is the only way. (There's a difference, which doesn't contradict Jesus' message in John 14.6).Spiritual faith is an issue which should be greatly respected, and Paine himself possessed a lot of faith in believing that there is one God, a life after death, and that his Deity was good - without any kind of Holy Scripture to base his faith upon. (There is certainly nothing in nature which reveals these issues - Paine claimed that Creation itself was his Deity's scripture to mankind).With regard to the Bible, Paine failed to appreciate the nature of figure of speeches and metaphors, which many Christians clearly see as reflecting deep, spiritual truths. Indeed, it is quite obvious that Holy Books such as the Bible ought not be approached in the same way a scientist would approach a literal account of the make up of a plant cell, for instance. Many of Paine's objections to the Bible can be easily refuted by simply breaking out of literalism.Indeed, a number of reviewers below who claim that the Christian message is a &quot;myth&quot;, themselves possess a lot of faith that Jesus was a liar and that the four writers of the gospels were also liars who made up an unprecedented story just for the sake it.Paine failed to appreciate the spiritual meaning of the Christian message, which is a message that I personally find makes a lot of sense. 'Sin', (which is anything 'not-Godly'), is inherent to mankind due to our natural, fallible ways. So God made the perfect sacrifice in order for us to enter into communion with Him without us being 'spiritually dirty', (for want of a better phrase). Hell, according to the Bible, is a spiritual realm where God is not, and the descriptions of Hell reveal exactly what Jesus has saved us FROM.Paine's book is useful because it reveals that many people's outlook toward the Christian faith is directed more at the dogma, biblical literalism, and narrow minded regulations. Really, the heart of Christianity is oriented toward spirituality, inner-strength, inspiration, fulfilment and liberation. It was this spiritual heart that Paine, and many other people, have failed to appreciate and have failed to discover.To me, this book is good for revealing a doubter's perspective, which fails to appreciate the deeper side of Christian spirituality."},{"Title":"The age of reason: Being an investigation of true and fabulous theology","review":"Just buy it....that's all I can say.."},{"Title":"The age of reason: Being an investigation of true and fabulous theology","review":"In his book, &quot;The Age of Reason&quot;, Thomas Paine, attempts, with some success, to destroy the two Western religions, i.e. Christianity and Judiasm. His major thrust is to undermind the Bible, by pointing out some irregularities in the text. He also attacks the morals of the Hebrews in the Old Testament(i.e. slaugtering the people of Canaan), and those in control of the Christian religion. These points are convincing, and I have not yet read a rebuttal of them, but not convincing enough to discredit either religon. On the downside, he gives himself way too much credit for liberating us from such &quot;faults&quot;, and many of the things he attacks don't seem quite as ridiculous as he believes them to be. Also, I find it interesting to see that Mr. Paine's 'Republican Religion', that is Deism, is all but dead, at least in form, yet Christianity and Judiasm continue along as they have for centuries. As a Christian, I found the book intellectualy stimulating, but nothing earth-shattering."},{"Title":"The age of reason: Being an investigation of true and fabulous theology","review":"Thomas Paine in his work considers Christianity as pure myth. His reasons for doing so are rather weak as he attempts to validate his work by apparent contadictions. Paine and others of his ilk (Voltaire, Rosseau) embraced the French Revolution and its logical conclusion in the Reign of Terror. The madness only stopped when Napoleon ended the revolution. So much for &quot;Free&quot; thinking men who believe that man is the measure of all things."},{"Title":"The age of reason: Being an investigation of true and fabulous theology","review":"The greatest thing about &quot;The Age of Reason&quot; is that it makes the reader think rather than blindly follow the herd. However, there are serious problems with the book from there on out that make it inherenty untenable.Consider Paine's argument that he can't accept the Bible because it is someone else's revelation and therefore hearsay--using this logic, we can't accept what Paine says as fact because the ideas presented are his own revelation to himself, meaning that it's all hearsay to us, his readers.Furthermore, Paine's argument in favor of &quot;reason&quot; in accepting or rejecting religion is fatally flawed. First of all, subscribing to a supernatural belief system, by its very nature, is an act of faith--reason is not even relevant when you're taking something on faith. And secondly, Paine himself is relying on faith rather than reason when he claims that God is evident through the creation of nature. How does he know God made nature? Where is his proof? How does he know it didn't get there all by some great cosmic accident? The answer is: he can't know. He's taking it on faith that God made nature--just as much faith, in fact, as a Judeo-Christian uses to believe in the word of the Bible. Deism, which still embraces a belief in God, is an odd stance to take for someone who spends an entire book ripping another belief system to shreds.Indeed, Paine's hostility toward Judeo-Christianity makes him more suited to be an outright atheist than a Deist, and one has to wonder whether Paine would have been an atheist had he lived today, with all the scientific/evolutionary information available to him that was not available at the time of his writing. Either that, or he would have become a Buddhist, since Buddhism requires no belief in anything supernatural and asks its followers to focus only on the here and now, because that's all there ever is. This approach would have suited Paine very well.As for the rest of us, I believe that all of us can truly only call ourselves agnostics. We can want to believe in a God, but there is no way of proving his existence, neither through nature nor a supposedly holy book.And as for the Bible itself, Paine is just as off-target in trying to interpret the Bible factually and scientifically as are the fundamentalist zealots who take every word at face value. A holy book is to be looked at for the lessons it teaches, not taken as literal and not analyzed for mistakes and contradictions. Both approaches are ludicrous.Paine also proves in this book that he's somewhat of a hypocrite. He quotes liberally from the Bible to advance many of his views in &quot;Common Sense,&quot; yet here he trashes that same Bible as superstitious nonsense. Apparently the Bible was useful to Paine only when it helped to promote his own cause.If nothing else, though, &quot;The Age of Reason&quot; does dispel the myth that all of our Founding Fathers were fundamentalist Christians. I'm sure that some were, but many--Jefferson and Franklin included--were in the Deist camp with Paine."},{"Title":"The age of reason: Being an investigation of true and fabulous theology","review":"I rate it as a very interesting critique of the Bible.

He wrote what he only believes without even hesitating about what other people might think about his opinion. He was very specific and sticks to his decision. He conveyed the message to the people about what he belief and disbelief.The age of reason is divided into two sections. The first section, the writer mentioned about how he believed in one God and he completely disbelief in any Church and talked about his thoughts upon religion. The second section deals with the Old and New Testament and the overall analysis of them.In the first part, Paine talks about what he believes and why should he believe something without having enough evidence or proof. According to him, he only belief in one God. He does not believe the creed professed by any church. Every other church possesses some mission from God that is communicated to human being and they have certain books to follow. Paine disbelief them all because they are not the actual word from Almighty, but instead the message is conveyed by people from generation to generation. His argument is clear and precise. The churches do not have any evidence to prove that they are the actual words of God and he does not have any authority to believe them all. He made a good argument when he said that it is false to call the science human inventions but rather it is the application of them that is human. Human being only discovers the principles but cannot make it. His second part mainly emphasized that the bible is an ancient fables written by different authors.This book is concise and is very easy to read it.

We should make every effort to become better \\"human beings\\", a level which I think we have not yet reached, by behaving in a just and moral manner and avoid following and believing in man-made superstitions and supernatural acts and believes.Ignorance is a man's worst enemy for freedom and man's best tool to control.AC.CHB"},{"Title":"The age of reason: Being an investigation of true and fabulous theology","review":"Cuban poet Jose Marti must have been thinking of individuals like Thomas Paine when he wrote: &quot;Animals follow the herd; men their free thought.&quot; In &quot;The Age of Reason,&quot; Paine asks us to break away from the &quot;herd&quot; of theistic religion and follow our free thought. But to accept this challenge, one must be willing to swim against the current of religious &quot;group-think&quot;; to give up the reassuring and dogmatic belief-system that replaced Santa Claus and the other fairytales of our childhood. And there is the rub! Paine uses the internal inconsistencies and factual errors in the Bible to expose it for the man-made fabrication that it is. And since his arguments are devastating and unanswerable, the only recourse for his detractors is to engage in ad hominem tirades against him or to challenge the propriety of his endeavor. Indeed, in his own time, Paine was made to endure unconscionable hardships and humiliations for challenging the foundations of the clericalist establishment.A more exhaustive expose of Biblical self-incrimination is presented in Joseph Wheless's book &quot;Is it God's Word? However, Paine's book, written more than 200 years ago and directed at the general public, is a historical landmark of religious dissent.Paine's religious views share much in common with the &quot;cosmic religious feeling&quot; described by Albert Einstein as linked to the &quot;sublimity and marvelous order which reveal themselves in both nature and the world of thought.&quot; Paine's book dares us to consider that yes, Virginia, there is a God, but not one with long hair and a beard who punishes little children for not saying their prayers at night."},{"Title":"The age of reason: Being an investigation of true and fabulous theology","review":"I have seen reviews here and elsewhere about Thomas Paine being ostricized, rejected, and living in poverty as a result of this book. They all could not be farther from truth. Paine lived in a rather nice cottage in New Rochelle, NY, its still there with his historical museumm, and several monuments throughtout town. Benjamin Franklin did not write anything in response to this book given the fact that Franklin died (1790) two years before Paine even began to write the Age of Reason (1792), not to mention Franklin himself was a deist as stated in his own autobiography. This book was the highest selling book in America in 1794, 1795, and 1807. Yes a few of our founding fathers did not like the book, and a few did. If you are curious about something you should find out for yourself, make your own decisions, or think with your own brain. Paine was a bold man who was brave enough to state what he believed in; unlike most herd minded Americans who let a Political party, a church, or their uneducated peers think for them. Read the Book, even if you disagree with it you might learn something."},{"Title":"The age of reason: Being an investigation of true and fabulous theology","review":"The Age of Reason is a brilliant defense of freethought and freedom of religious belief. Paine is NOT an atheist as claimed by fanatical believers. Paine is a Deist and an opponent of atheism. Paine dissects the Bible's origins, falsehoods, fables and contadictions. Paine had tremendous courage in writing this since religious belief is usually the most fanatical and anti-intellectual when it's fangs are extended. Paine wrote this to enlighten the human mind and show how organized religion warps the mind and causes reason and investigation to become trumped by superstition, metaphysics, and revelation. A great book to open the mind."},{"Title":"The age of reason: Being an investigation of true and fabulous theology","review":"Paine was a revolutionary thinker, one of the most expanded minds of his time. The Age of Reason is a monument to freethought - not atheism - but freethought. Paine was not an atheist, but a deist, and this book goes miles towards freeing people who want to hold on to God-belief while rejecting constricting, human religion. I myself am an atheist and don't agree with him on deism, but for so many mystics and agnostic theists today who seek another way to harmonize philosophical God-belief and intelligence, this is THE book to have. The points that are made are keenly insightful. This work paved the road for so many freethinkers to travel. This book is a classic.(JH)www.ministerturnsatheist.org"},{"Title":"The age of reason: Being an investigation of true and fabulous theology","review":"I just quickly want to say: It is because of [certain] people ... that you should read this book. We all have to deal with them on a daily basis. Intolerance of any dissenting opinion. Thomas Paine was a great man who did not bow to \\"The Emperor's New clothes Crowd\\". He has helped me not to also."},{"Title":"The age of reason: Being an investigation of true and fabulous theology","review":"After reading this work, the reader comes away thinking that Paine not only finds the concept of YHWH impossible, he finds it downright blasphemous. Paine obviously was fearing the theocrats that plagued the world then (and indeed now). Given that this work was put together in the 18th century, it also is notable how long many of the questions about Biblical errency have gone unanswered. It still stands up today."},{"Title":"The age of reason: Being an investigation of true and fabulous theology","review":"With The Age of Reason, Thomas Paine sets out to argue against the truth of the Bible from a perspective of deism. His main argument hinges on the fact that most parts of the Bible are based solely on hearsay and are published by anonymous authors whose credibility is unknown. At times his refuations seem a bit lengthy. The mere fact that the Old Testament history spans such a long period of time (well past the life-span of a single man) plus the fact that it mentions Moses' death is sufficient to prove that Moses did not write these histories. But Paine points out every pain-staking detail just to be sure. He does the same with the texts attributed to various other people, noting that their word usage and descriptions of certain historical events rule out the possibility that they wrote these texts. He also points out that the Gospels were written many years after Jesus's lifetime, and that there is no reason to suppose the writers were eyewitnesses.Of course, throughout the book Paine also offers all sorts of other evidence. He points out many of the injustices of the Bible, from Elisha's causing she-bears to devour children to God's commands for the chosen people to kill women and children. Now, he does not issue a logical argument about how such attributes are incompatible with an all-powerful, all-good deity, but he brings them up to show a sort of instinctive reason to doubt that a being that could create such a wonderful planet could also commit such evil. (Nevermind that this planet contains such wonderful things as parasites and viruses!) Another of Paine's argument is that \\"to prophesy\\" originally meant \\"to sing\\" in the Bible, and the predictions of the prophets weren't meant to apply to descriptions of events hundreds or thousands of years into the future, but to very recent events in the prophets' lifetimes.Overall, The Age of Reason casts much doubt on the truth of the Bible, although it does so in a very common-sense manner. Paine is very rigorous in bringing out the contradictions and exposing doubts about the book. Anyone who accepts the Bible's truth with unwavering certainty, or even anyone who feels a lingering doubt about it, should definitely subject their beliefs to Paine's quick criticisms. A healthy dosage of skepticism never harmed anyone, after all."},{"Title":"The age of reason: Being an investigation of true and fabulous theology","review":"I accept Thomas Paine into my heart as my personal Lord and Savior! Before I even read the &quot;Age of Reason&quot; I knew what I believed, but I did not know there was a word to define my beliefs: Deism. Those who still adhere to organized religion do not know what they are missing. When you read Thomas Paine, you simply can not ignore the clear flawless syllogisms that prove revealed religion false and useless. So, parents, if you want your children to grow up as moral, spiritual, logical individuals, you should expose them to Deism and read Age of Reason to them before they go to sleep. That's what I'm going to do."},{"Title":"The age of reason: Being an investigation of true and fabulous theology","review":"Paine's writing is rich with stunning clarity. He was one of America's most brilliant and inspiring writers. That is if you don't read any of 'RICKYTHEREADER's reviews. RICKYTHEREADER has reviewed exactly four books on the amazon website, all about Paine and all delving into proselytizing (over 50 mentions of the bible or Jesus between the four reviews). Further, he's obsessed with the fact that Paine failed out of school at the age of 12. Does this mean we must discount his body of work? Einstein was a slow learner, perhaps that 'lightbulb' idea wasn't quite as good as we all thought. Hey, think what you want, but disliking someone's views has little to do with the quality of their work. Especially of someone as deservingly revered as Paine. If he's such a mediocre writer, why did RICKYTHEREADER dig into FOUR of his books? I love Paine, but I've not read that many! My message to RICKYTHEREADER: Love God if you wish, but don't write reviews with an agenda. Write a review of the work."},{"Title":"The age of reason: Being an investigation of true and fabulous theology","review":"Thomas Paine is my hero and I can never express how much I admire his intelligence and courage. It could not have been easy for him given the fact that even today, people are still rediculously closed minded.I dare anyone to say that this book does not make sense.

Challenge any of your xtian friends to read it and you will certainly have a lively debate."},{"Title":"The age of reason: Being an investigation of true and fabulous theology","review":"Great book. Reading this reminds me how much we've lost the art of language. If you've ever felt that something was off with Christianity you owe it to yourself to read this book. Paine methodically points out the inconsistencies he sees in an ancient religion that seems more like mythology. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The age of reason: Being an investigation of true and fabulous theology","review":"You won't see Thomas Paine's face added to Mt Rushmore. Although he played a great role part in the founding of this nation and its principles of government, some give him credit for writing a huge part of the Declaration of Independence and his genius in writing is readily displayed, he just wasn't politically correct enough for the role of a \\"Founding Father\\".In writing the Age of Reason, he sat down while waiting impending fall of the guillotines blade and dashed off a few thoughts on religion as he saw it being used for profit, power and political gain by exploiting humanity for decades. He believed in God, but not the mythologies created by man. I would also recommend The Faiths of the Founding Fathers, by David L. Holmes if you're interested as to why deism was so popular at the time."},{"Title":"The House of the Arrow","review":"A.E. W. Mason wrote a good many books, of which his romantic adventure &quot;The Four Feathers&quot; may be the best known today. In his own time, however, he was famous as a successor to Conan Doyle, and his detective, the great Hanaud, was much appreciated by readers in early 20th century Britain. Mason chose a different track than some: where other writers made their detectives less eccentric than Sherlock Holmes, Mason went in the opposite direction: Hanaud is French, an egomaniac, a part of the official machinery rather than an aristocratic amateur, and accompanied by as many as two Watsons! In all of this he may have inspired Agatha Christie to make her detective a foreign policeman, Poirot. Making a foreigner the hero was risky in the xenophobic days of Empire, but Mason succeeded.A number of the Hanaud books are currently available, at least used. The most famous of them, and the best by far, was this book &quot;The House of the Arrow&quot;. In its time it was the most celebrated detective story in English. It still rewards reading by fans of the golden age. I realize that it is out of print. But I leave this little review as a signpost for potential readers. If you like this sort of thing, and you come across it online, in a library, or in a used book shop, by all means pick it up. It was recommended to me when I was 10, and I didn't find a copy until I was 16, but I am glad I did.

I found the tips a bit 'old hat' and the illustrations very old hat, the sort of tips and techniques you could easily pick up in an hour's search on the net, AND with better colour examples.Still, to keep things in perspective, the book IS 5 years old and it shows.Buy it if you want a cheap second-hand book for your shelf.

What a disappointment! First, this book came out in 2001 (probably written in 2000) when Photoshop Elements (PSE) first saw light, and Windows XP still was a promise on the horizon. Of course we now have PSE version 2 (as well as XP); the \\"free trial software\\" on the CD, likewise, is badly outdated [PhotoImpact now is in ver 8, rather than ver 6 offered]. Not good, but not fatal thus far, because PSE commands haven't changed all that drastically in the new version [the former 'square marquee', for instance, now is named 'rectangular marquee']. But, really unpardonable, are the assumptions, errors and omissions in the tutorials themselves. In the first technique alone I found two inexcusable faults: (a) author blithely talks about 'options' that pop up in the 'options bar' when you select a tool - well, he just forgot to tell me to first turn on the 'options bar' in the Windows menu, so I had to go through the Help menus to learn that fact. (b) in adding a border to the bottom of the image, you are directed to the 'canvas size' dialog, where a complicated 3x3 grid just begs for explanation of 'anchor point', rather than for \\"getting the hang of it\\" all by myself. And, not so incidentally, if one wants to add a lower 0.25 bottom border to a 10\\" tall image, the proper new height is 10.25 -- not 10.75 as printed. Clearly, this book was written hastily and without thorough proof reading. Equally clearly, I stopped after chapter 1 to find a more compassionate tutor - PSE's Help topics and built-in tutorial will do quite nicely to get you started. The center-bound color plates, moreover, were a nice bonus in the digital camera book, but a minus in a photo-editing tutorial where color plates should appear right with the applicable text. Not the least, the black and white vignettes reproduce poorly on the pulpy (?recycled) paper. I may be overly harsh on this author, but he's shown that he CAN write a superb tutorial - let's hope the forthcoming second edition corrects the shortcomings of the first edition. Overall: a less than successful recipe collection, that rises to a decent cookbook on occasion. There must be better, and more current, tutorials around - I haven't found one yet."},{"Title":"50 Fast Digital Photo Techniques with Photoshop Elements 3","review":"I really can't recommend this book - the information is dated and succeeds in very few places. There's 50 examples here, but they're so elementary that you can't really call them &quot;techniques&quot;. I think the &quot;help&quot; search menu in Elements could do the same job.I bought this book hoping to learn some techniques to better my digital darkroom, but the book was so poorly organized and assembled, I was left feeling jipped. For example, the author might as well have left all the b&amp;w example images off his pages - the center color examples are better, but really should've been intermixed with the corresponding chapters. I'd look at the example images and since they were in b&amp;w, you often couldn't tell the difference between the before and after images.Also, nearly 5-10 of his techniques are basically about applying filters. Ooh great, go to filter-sharpening - wabam. Thanks, but that's not why I thought I was buying the book.Perhaps I'm being too harsh on this book, but I really can't escape the feeling that something just wasn't &quot;right&quot; with the way this book flowed.

I bought PS Elements and only had very limited knowledge of how to take advantage of the features. After going through each and every one of the 50 techniques I feel very confident.

All of the projects are quick and practical, and his results are really artistic. Two tables at the end of the book compare the commands of Photoshop Elements to Photoshop LE 5 and Photoshop 6; and to Paint Shop Pro 7, Photo-Paint 10, and Photoimpact 6, so you can also use the techniques with those other programs. I highly recommend this book, which is the best &quot;hands-on&quot; book on a graphics program I have ever used.

None of these techniques are hard to follow, and all can be accomplished with a variety of image-editing programs, not just Photoshop. It is, in fact, geared more towards the lower-end Photoshop Elements than the full program.

It also helps present the depth and power of the PS Elements application.For those who use other photo editing applications, the author has included an Appendix to provide translation tables for popular photo editing applications other than PS Elements.Using various creative techniques described in the book, I've created some *awesome* images from my personal slide library (scanned using a film/slide scanner).

My intention at the time of ordering was to buy a book to learn more about hardware features of digital camera, and how to combine different settings to get the best shots. I thought: \\"I've got an excellent Canon G2 camera, and the photos it makes are just too fine to edit them with any image processing software\\". Nevertheless, I ordered this book because it had a very good rating.To my surprise, the \\"complete digital photography\\" did not came out to be of any use for me, because my limited (as I thought before) knowledge of digital camera features was really quite good, and this book (and I guess oll of this kind) is oriented on ONLY THE BEGINNERS in d-photography. Besides, the CD supplied with the book contained images of poor quality.Contrary to this book, the \\"50 fast digital photo techniques\\" came out to be very useful, as it adresses few but VERY USEFUL methods to greatly improve the quality of a digital photo, including advice how to eliminate color cast, a very new (to me) way to make the photo more sharp etc. The great thing about this book is that it contains a CD with 100 photos of a very high quality and size: 50 original photos, and 50 \\"corrected\\" photos. There are 50 lessons in the book, and each lesson addresses one specific photo. There is also a very particular instruction how to correct the original photo by YOURSELF to get the final image.Finally I should say that because I have to shoot too many photos without having enough time to set proper settings on the camera, this book helped me to make an excellent photos of those original shots wich I wanted to delete before."},{"Title":"50 Fast Digital Photo Techniques with Photoshop Elements 3","review":"What a great way to learn the basics of photo editing!

Based on a series of lectures, this small book is easy to read and full of insight and wisdom, gleaned from his many years of experience as a therapist, and devoted to the work of C.G. Jung. Richard Chachere is wonderfully warm and down to earth in his presentation, and the images of the film resonate vibrantly anew with Chachere's interpretation."},{"Title":"American Beauty: Jungian Reflections (Jungian Reflections on Literary and Film Classics)","review":"Richard Chachere's Jungian Reflections on the film, American Beauty, is the deeply personal conversation you never had with your best friend or your mentor about certain universally-shared fears and fantasies you mistakenly believe are yours alone. It is a touchstone of familiar and provocative images from film, literature and the arts that symbolize the dysfunction in our relationships. It is about looking hard at one's own complexes. In the end, and perhaps most importantly, it is about the truly beautiful in life and about the heroic but often undeveloped quality of the human psyche. A must read for anyone at work (and at play) in the psychic garden of perfect roses and painful thorns."},{"Title":"American Beauty: Jungian Reflections (Jungian Reflections on Literary and Film Classics)","review":"this is that rare book in jungian circles, and realy clear explanation and working out of a way of looking at at film that is not only very interesting but gives the reader much nourishing food for thought. his explanations of the negative side of our personalities, the self limiting voices in our heads is realy so clear and elucidating. highly recomended."},{"Title":"American Beauty: Jungian Reflections (Jungian Reflections on Literary and Film Classics)","review":"This book resonated with the search I had started for what lies deep inside me, with the search to be whole, to be honest.

Mr. Chachere offers the reader a clear reflective mirror and a delectable menu of insights with which to view the film anew and to explore what it might have to say to us about ourselves and our relationships. This is Jung brought home. Based on a series of lectures given to a live audience, the book is both timely and timeless in its wisdom and easy to read in its simplicity and warmth. Jungian concepts are brought down to earth,and well-illustrated with art and example. Most accurately, Chachere's reflections can serve as a doorway worth exploring, a doorway to saner and more human living and loving."},{"Title":"Death at the President's Lodging","review":"My favorite Inspector Appleby mysteries take place in an academic setting. This subset of his mystery novels is undoubtedly a byproduct of the many years that Michael Innes (whose real name was John Innes Mackintosh Stewart) spent laboring in the halls of academia. Among the seats of learning where he taught are Queen's University in Belfast, and the universities of Oxford, Adelaide, and Leeds.The author could not help but involve a legion of eccentric, pompous, and even murderous professors in the death of the president of St. Anthony's College (modeled after the colleges at Oxford University). Their academic spats and bumblings are a good part of what makes this book readable. Innes is wickedly funny when it comes to poking fun at the habits of his donnish colleagues and undergraduates.&quot;Death at the President's Lodging&quot; starts out as a locked room mystery where the only suspects are locked into the college grounds for the night. The president's body is found in his own library, but we gradually learn that the corpse was subject to a great deal of postmortem perambulation as his colleagues try to establish their own alibis and manufacture evidence that points to their academic enemies. Nothing is as it first seems, not even time of death.A trio of undergraduates provides the comic relief as they chase one of the suspects (supposedly at an archeological dig in the Middle East) across the English countryside and finally deliver him to Inspector Appleby in a large wicker clothes basket (shades of Falstaff!).As Inspector Appleby winds his way through the skeins of plot and counter-plot created by great intellects gone murderously askew, his intuition is played off against the rather unimaginative plodding of local Constable Dodd. Dodd is a bit of a dry stick compared to the irrepressible Appleby, who in his very first appearance in this mystery (published in 1936), is already showing signs of what his successor at Scotland Yard refers to as his 'waywardness.'Enjoy Inspector John Appleby's literary debut for the hijinks of the undergraduates, the plots and counter-plots of their devious professors, and the erudite style of their donnish creator.

Dr Josiah Umpleby, President of St Anthony's College, has been shot and Inspector Appleby is sent to help local authority, Inspector Dodd, discover the murderer. The mystery is very much an academic exercise, with Appleby outlining possible suspects, motives and methods. Of course, there are many red herrings and much confusion, involving professional arguments, academic digressions and many misleading clues. The book is a little dry at the beginning, but if you enjoy novels set in this era and this type of academic mystery, then you will really enjoy it.Appleby is a very intelligent, well read hero, whose abilities in deduction consist more in considering and working out the clues, rather than in action. There is a wonderful scene at the end, where Appleby, in time honoured fashion, addresses the Fellows of the College and outlines what and how happened. Finally, there is also an excellent bibliography and synopses of the author's books. The next in the Appleby series isHamlet Revenge (Inspector Appleby Mystery)and I am sure I will be reading on."},{"Title":"Death at the President's Lodging","review":"The President of St Anthony's College is found shot dead in his lodgings. Inspector John Appleby, once a student of St Anthony's and now of Scotland Yard is sent to investigate and finds himself in the middle of a very complex investigation which will test all his considerable investigative powers. It will also test the deductive powers of the most observant reader. At first it seems as though there are at least ten possibly suspects not to speak of the passing murderous vagrant who may or may not have been able to get in.The author brings to life the pre-war world of academia with its rivalries and jealousies and its collection of powerful intellects. Compared with modern crime fiction a lot is expected of the reader who needs to be able to appreciate the literary references as well as the occasional Latin quotation not to speak of keeping tabs on the whereabouts of all the suspects at the relevant times.I enjoyed reading this fascinating and complex crime novel first published during the Golden Age of British crime fiction. It gives modern readers a glimpse of a long vanished way of life and culture. If you enjoy Dorothy L Sayers and Agatha Christie then you will probably enjoy Michael Innes. This is the first book in his Appleby series."},{"Title":"Death at the President's Lodging","review":"I'm a fan of Dorothy Sayers and Rex Stout; I like genteel mysteries. I was hoping Innes would be an author I could add to my collection.The opening is very nice and the beginning was promising - the President of the College lies dead and all sorts of strange clues abound! But the characters never developed at all nor did they have any interesting hooks to them. Most importantly, Inspector Appleby was vanilla bland. As a result, I lost interest quickly as to who was where at what time and whatnot.I soldiered through to the end and was sorely disappointed. I won't give anything away except to say that the solution to the mystery was so convoluted and contrived, I almost believe it was self-parody. All in all, not a great read. A mystery can either have great characters and atmosphere OR it can have a satisfying puzzle to solve (and hopefully both). Death at the President's Lodging, unfortunately, had neither."},{"Title":"Death at the President's Lodging","review":"My favorite Inspector Appleby mysteries take place in an academic setting.

I'm not suggesting Innes bursts the boundaries of his form like Borges or Chesterton. On its most obvious level, this is a typical product of Golden Age detective fiction - conservative, obviously ideological, a puzzle-like mystery solved by a socially and intellectually superior detective, archly written, set in a socially acceptable milieu (an Oxbridge college) full of the right people, with amusing instances of outright snobbery. But if he doesn't burst his genre's limits, Innes certainly seems to nag at them. Because, in his almost complete abstraction of plot to the exclusion of meaningful character or locale ; in his filtering of third person objective narration with the voices of the narrated; in his continual self-referentiality; in his meaningful allusinism which both focuses on the genre, but also well away from it; in, most importantly, casting doubt on his detective hero and offering a very unsatisfactory solution, Innes seems to be edging towards a position that would allow Borges to launch his metaphysical fantasies, thus undermining the very fundamentals of the genre he's working in."},{"Title":"Los Angeles: Where Anything Is Possible","review":"For the person who's never been to L.A., LOS ANGELES Where Anything is Possible by Larry Brownstein will offer both a macro and a micro view. You'll be exposed to several, yet very different, angles of the L.A. skyline. Mr. Brownstein works like a painter in the way he captures the lights of the cars, the streetlights, and the building windows. He also takes you up close to people and sites, and he'll help you see much more at Venice that just the obvious.For me, living in the suburbs of Los Angeles, the thrill of familiarity resonated when I recognized places I had been-\\"Hey, I've been there!\\" At the same time, I hadn't seen what Mr. Brownstein sees. He captured my imagination and introduced a different perspective. His shot of Griffith Observatory in the Architecture section lends a feeling of quiet that I hadn't observed there before. Now I want to go back and see if I can see what he showed me. His beautiful shot of Santa Monica pier with motion blur of the Ferris Wheel and the dancing lights reflected in the water made me question if I had seen the same pier with my own eyes.How many times can a common sight in Los Angeles such as the Theme Restaurant at LAX be photographed? Larry Brownstein captured it in more than one photograph here that had me looking carefully-there was something new in this shot. Whether it's the unique sunset shot of Randy's Donuts on Manchester Blvd. or a sunny happy view of Six Flags Hurricane Harbor with the old roller coasters we know in the background, this book displays common sights in L.A. in a charming, uncommon way.I shared this book with my neighbor who, being new to California, didn't know what the Disney Concert Hall was (on the cover). As he looked at it, I saw a grin come across his face as he said, \\"Hey! This is where I got married!\\" His enthusiasm was evident as he pointed out the exact spot in the Greek Orthodox Cathedral where he stood with his wife as bride and groom, \\"I don't know HOW he got that shot!\\"The book is organized into sections: Sights & Landmarks, Parades, Festivals & Celebrations, Architecture, Amusement Parks, The Beach, Shopping, Sports, and Cars. Some shots make you want to go out and find the detail (like the tile work around Watts Towers), and other shots simply make you smile like the Society Ladies in the Doo Dah Parade.This book is a great gift for friends and relatives who have never been to L.A., a souvenir for those who've just left, or a memento/going-away gift for someone moving out of state.

Strengths of the book include: (a) For each vocabulary item an English word derived from the Greek is put in brackets; this helps vocabulary building and creates familiarity with the language. (b) Somewhat technical discussions are put in boxes so that students realize the information is not essential. The student can gloss over, skip, or come back to these boxes at a later time. (c) The student begins reading actual New Testament Greek from John's Gospel in Lession Six. Thus the student feels a sense of accomplishment and &quot;light at the end of the tunnel&quot; as she progresses through each lesson. Explanatory notes accompany the readings from John's Gospel."},{"Title":"An Introductory New Testament Greek Course","review":"I finally purchased a copy of this book on Amazon here, which I wish I had done many years ago. This course is on Greek of the New Testament, and Prof. Gignac informs the reader of many things about how the NT's Greek came to be the way it is. This answers many questions that rise in the student's mind.Perhaps there may be too much detail, but often this is contained in the boxes of information, which you may look at and then concentrate upon the text, or pass up. Sometimes there ought to be more information in these boxes, to really explain well what is being gotten at, or perhaps the information should be in an appendix at the end of the book.Using this NT Greek book will exercise your mind and help you to learn Greek, but you must pay attention to all the information, and store the paradigms in your mind. This is true of any Greek primer, and there is no way of getting away from the work of storing the details of the forms in your mind, in order to really learn Greek. The inductive courses(like Athenaze and the Cambridge Greek course are alternative means, in which you get into reading, and along the journey you acquire the forms, but you still need to learn the information about all the Greek forms.I liked this book. Having it when I studied Greek many years ago would have answered questions that rose in my mind.In the text and at the back is a chapter on bilingualism in Greek of the Bible. That is, the Semitic background of the NT is gone into, due to the Hebrew?Aramaic language that the apostles and their companions had learned as their first language. Gignac includes many points about how this shows up in the Greek of the NT(and the LXX). I reckon others will have different points of view on this, but I cannot think of many other primers that deal with this.I recommend the book, but for someone learning at home, if you have not had a book on Greek, you would be well off to have a book that gives you answers to exercises, so that you can check yourself. For that I would recommend David BlacksLearn to Read New Testament Greekintroductory course, or the nice introductory book that Kinchin Smith and MelluishANCIENT GREEK: A FOUNDATION COURSE (TEACH YOURSELF)gave us(the latter of which is directed toward all ancient Greek, not just the NT."},{"Title":"An Introductory New Testament Greek Course","review":"I have the pleasure of studying under Fr. Gignac at CUA, and this textbook is a terrific introduction, especially for those who plan to acquire NT Greek for work in textual criticism as opposed to simply acquiring reading comprehension. As the other reviewer pointed out, most of the more techinical linguistic discussions are boxed off, so the absolute beginner does not have to worry him- or herself with these at the outset. However, the information they provide are valuable for acquiring the ability to read other forms of Greek besides Koine, by discussing how particular forms developed from their Indo-European roots (and some simple comparisons with analogous forms in Latin and occasionally English or Sanskrit). The text is rigorous, and the diligent student will be reading actual NT Greek quite early on, which provides a sense of encouragement that is so helpful in studying a new language."},{"Title":"An Introductory New Testament Greek Course","review":"As a beginning student who was not in a formal classroom setting, I wasn't too fond of it. While the text does have some good qualities, I can't recommend it. The format had an outdated 1970's look to it--seems to have been printed from a typewritten manuscript with the accents added by hand. This is harder on the eyes than newer textbooks with bullet lists, shaded textboxes and wider margins to help guide the eyes.My biggest gripe is with its presentation of the verbs. The first chapter to deal with verbs covers the entire system of Greek verbs. Subsequent chapters do break it down, but still much too compact for my needs. I'd like to see more examples, especially contrasting the tenses; also want more coverage of participles, infinitives...everything.Text is best suited for someone in linguistics wanting an overview of NT Greek, or as a review grammar. Beginners should look elsewhere - or at least have a second grammar on hand to compare (e.g. Mounce -Basics of Biblical Greek Grammar)."},{"Title":"An Introductory New Testament Greek Course","review":"Not really a review, just an error I noticed by accident.

It was either this one or the Bantam collection edited by Moses Hadas - a mass market edition. I'd read the Bantam one, and it contains a number of the plays by each, plus an Aristophenes comedy, in a perhaps slightly stiff translation. It was actually tough to ascertain the contents of this Penguin book, as no shop seemed to have it, and there was no \\"look inside\\" feature for it on Amazon, so I went ahead and bought it. I'm not disappointed.It contains less plays than the Bantam: Just Aeschylus' Agamemnon, Sophocles' Oedipus Rex and Euripedes' Medea. It also has a nice intro about Greek Tragedy, and selections from Aristotle's Poetics. Having fewer plays than the Bantam, it feels a lot less crammed. I was pleased by the selection, as I personally think they're the single best play of each playwright. Decent translations.So...if you're looking for something to serve as a nice sampling of Greek Traj, perhaps for someone new to the genre, without running the risk of overwhelming, it's a good choice."},{"Title":"Greek tragedy;: Emendations, interpretations and critical notes,","review":"This review focuses on the Kindle reading experience of this e-book, rather than on the literary merits of the e-book.In a word, the Kindle experience is dreadful. Don't waste your money on this e-book.The poor (non-existent?) post-scan editing of the e-book means it has plenty of errors. This criticism is equally true of every other low-priced e-book I have bought from Amazon.More importantly, none of the numerous end notes can be immediately accessed in the same one-click way you can look up the meaning of a word using the Kindle dictionary.To get to any desired end note, the reader has to use the Kindle's clunky, frustrating \\"Go To Location\\" functionality in a laborious trial and error process. Kindle \\"locations\\" have no obvious relation to actual pages, which makes the search process even more frustrating.But why get so worked up about end notes? Why not just ignore them?Unfortunately you can't just ignore the end notes if you want to appreciate all the nuances of the plays in this e-book. The plays are full of topical references to Greek gods, to notable figures of the time and to current affairs - all of which would be well known to contemporary audiences. Without that knowledge the modern reader simply cannot appreciate much of the worth of these tragedies.Most readers of ancient classics are not just casual readers. They have a different motivation and will certainly want to access end notes to help them get as much out of the text as they can.The end notes are invaluable in providing all the needed explanatory background to appreciate the jokes and allusions. And there are hundreds of end notes, so it is obvious how important they are.Exactly the same criticism can be made of any other e-book with end notes - or of any e-book where the reader wants to refer frequently and quickly to different parts of the e-book to consult maps, diagrams, tables and the like.Kindles are great for reading slabs of text from beginning to end, but frustratingly hopeless for reading books where you want to refer frequently to different parts of a book."},{"Title":"The dead bird (Young Scott books)","review":"In 1964 I found this book in a library in Augsburg, Germany while searching for a way to explain to my 5 year old daughter the sudden death of her 3 month old brother. I checked the book out and read it to her that afternoon. The simple story of a group of children finding the dead bird and burying it with a little, sincere and heart-felt ceremony was comforting to her, and with the last picture of the children playing nearby and falling leaves beginning to cover the little grave she was able to understand the finality of death. She said, &quot;And we'll always be able to remember Matt when we want to, won't we, Dad?&quot; This is the only &quot;real&quot; Childrens' book about death that I have ever seen. It should be in every pre-school and kindergarten library; no, in every library!"},{"Title":"The dead bird (Young Scott books)","review":"I bought this book in a discount bin (along with William's Doll, another inexpensive paperback classic!) many years ago when my older kids (now 13 and 14) were toddlers.I brought it out recently when my father died and it sat all week in our shiva house, where it evoked a whole range of reactions from all the adults my 3-year-old daughter asked to read it to her (over and over and over, which should tell you something).While many adults reading the book were taken aback by the format of words appearing on pages with no pictures (and vice versa), kids have always seemed to understand it intrinsically: the format forces you to hear the words, pause, see the picture, then pause again before the next words.This format uniquely allows kids breathing room to think their own thoughts about the pictures and the story.Other adults were appalled that the children were dealing with death all alone, and that the book actually used the word \\"dead\\" without euphemism. Again, that's a-okay in my book: the right words are the only words I try to use with my kids, even if those words are not always lovely. There'll be time enough later on to learn the thousand euphemisms for death.A few practical folks just pointed out that it's not advisable for anyone to handle dead wildlife. Of course not. I make a point of telling my kids that if they find a dead bird (especially in this era of West Nile) that they're to come show me.In any event: the book. The simple, childish illustrations by Remy Charlip are timeless and unforgettable and complement the simplicity of the storyline perfectly.The last page of the book adds so much simply by mentioning that the children do eventually forget about the dead bird. In the final picture, they're playing ball in a nearby field. It's a beautiful day: life goes on.Death is part of life, but it's not what life is all about. Life, especially for kids, is about the ballgames, and the grief / mourning process is how we get ourselves back to that normal.Unlike other books for kids about death, it doesn't deal at all with the specifics of dying OR losing someone you love. It simply begins when the bird is dead. Those are important themes, but for younger kids, I have found it so helpful to break it down: the conversation about death does not HAVE to be the conversation about dying, if that makes any sense.Piece by piece, kids eventually make sense of the world around them. Books like this one really help."},{"Title":"The dead bird (Young Scott books)","review":"I've known this book since my kids were small, 40 years ago.

While perusing the stacks of English Literature holdings at my library, I literally bumped into this book with my elbow, saw that it was misshelved, and also noticed the fact that Ray Bradbury had seen fit to write an introduction to it. How could I not examine this little book, given such circumstances? It proved to be a most fortuitous meeting, as I quite enjoyed my short adventure at Headlong Hall.Peacock, it seems, was a venerable man of letters, a man of great wit and fancy who catered not to the popular imagination but principally produced works of prose and poetry for those of a scholarly, even antiquarian, mind. Headlong Hall, first published anonymously in 1816, is the first of Peacock's several novels; the book exists not so much to tell a story as to engage in discourses upon a myriad of subjects with something of a satirical air. Seeing as how Peacock wrote during the first half of the nineteenth century, some of his satirical passages relate to politics and social thinking I am wholly unfamiliar with in this day and age, but there remains plenty to delight those who love a good display of sagacity. Peacock could not only pontificate about all manner of subjects, he could land jibes from both directions upon the lot of them. There is a taste of Plato in his delineations of philosophical debates, yet the entire pageantry of pedantry found in Headlong Hall is always tempered by the affability of the host (Squire Headlong) and the liberal distribution of spirits among all parties. Don't expect to fall in love with any of the book's characters or engage your emotions to any significant degree (despite Peacock's insertion of a modicum of romance) with the story, for this is a book of ideas as represented by somewhat satirical characters.What you have in Headlong Hall is a gathering of intellectuals by Squire Headlong, who has developed a desire to be seen as a man of taste. He seems to enjoy nothing better than a spirited debate among the learned - he doesn't really care what anyone has to say, though. Everyone gets to talk, and it doesn't really matter that no one actually listens because the parties involved consist predominantly of the types of men who enjoy hearing themselves talk in the first place. By way of example, you have Mr. Foster, a \\"perfectabilian\\" who extols the wonders of progress in the world, and Mr. Escot, a \\"deteriorationist\\" who lauds the goodness of the \\"natural\\" man, impugns progress at every turn, and basically consigns all of mankind to the compost heap of history. In between these two, there is Mr. Jenkinson, a \\"statu-quo-ite\\" who finds balance in everything. There are other parties joining in the fun, including a scattering of writers and critics, but those aforementioned afford one a good sense of the story's nature.It's amazing to see a writer argue opposite sides of any given debate so effectively. Peacock has no trouble tolerating a fool, although he tends to poke a little fun while doing so. Peacock himself was seemingly no fan of popular ideas or the boastings of high-minded intellectuals, but it is hard to identify what he himself believes from the pages of this novel. I should also mention the prose itself, for it can be rough going at times. Peacock was a most educated man, and he uses more than his share of \\"big words\\" that mean nothing to me (who among you can readily define such words as philotheoparoptesism or osseocarnisanguineoviscericartilaginonervomedullary and use them in a sentence?). He also liberally sprinkles Latin and Greek quotations in the text, most of which (at least in the edition of the book I read) are not translated for the modern reader. Overall, though, Headlong Hall is a most extraordinary short novel that will appeal primarily to those with a scholarly bent and an appreciation for subtle humor and satire."},{"Title":"Headlong Hall","review":"Headlong Hall, an almost 200-year-old satire by Thomas Love Peacock, is the name of the ancestral home of the Headlongs, Welsh gentry of ample means and some intellectual ambition. Squire Headlong has invited a slice of the English beau monde for a country house party. The guests typify popular and competing philosophies of the day: the man who thinks life is a constant process of improvement, his hell-in-a-handbasket opposite, mister status-quo, a minister committed to religious conviction but not action; and a variety of others.The action is a slapstick device for gently but firmly skewering the fashionable intellectual pretensions of the day, most of which are equally at home in the 21st Century. The landscape architect, a novelty in 1815, can easily be replaced with any zealous enthusiast of today. The only real surprise I found was the comparative youth of the characters; but in a time before antibiotics seriousness came early in life.The writing is typical of the time and will seem stilted to the modern reader; but if you are comfortable with Jane Austen, you will have no trouble with Mr. Peacock, although I did need a dictionary at hand. As with most satires, it is a pleasantly short confection, only about 80 pages; and the footnotes are a joke unto themselves."},{"Title":"Money Making Marketing (How to Make Serious Money with Your Own Mobile Food Business) Volume 2","review":"I OWN HOT DOG CARTS you pull or push around i rather be small then own what this talks about ..its all about finding a good place 2 set up this big trailer type concession stand i would say start out small do not get bigger unless your sure you can dish out all that money and make more back JUST REMEMBER IT COST MONEY TO MAKE MONEY"},{"Title":"Beat Psoriasis: Simple and Effective Treatment--The Natural Way (Thorsons Health)","review":"I was underwhelmed.

Leacock, who died in 1944, became arguably the most prominent Canadian humorist of his day (and probably of all time). What is ironic about that claim is that Leacock worked for most of his life as a professor of economics. We do not usually equate economics with humor, preferring to think of that profession as one of bow ties and supply and demand charts. Throw that presumption out the window and pick up a copy of \\"Sunshine Sketches of a Little Town,\\" Leacock's best known work available through the New Canadian Library series.For me, one of the funniest sections of the book was the introduction written by Leacock, where he gives you some background about himself and his profession. This short piece of writing quickly gives you an idea of the type of humor you will find in the actual sketches: a very sly, very quiet and clever type of humor that often takes a while to sink in. Leacock does not rely on rim shot jokes or manic posturing in his writings. Instead, he creates the fictional Canadian town of Mariposa and populates it with small town archetypes that are wonders to behold.All of the characters are hilarious in their own way: Mr. Smith, the proprietor of the local hotel and bar, full of schemes to earn money while trying to get his liquor license back. Then there is Jefferson Thorpe, the barber involved in financial schemes that may put him on the level of the Morgans and the Rockefellers. The Reverend Mr. Drone presides over the local Church of England in Mariposa, a man who reads Greek as easy as can be but laments his lack of knowledge about logarithms and balancing the financial books of the church. Peter Pupkin, the teller at the local bank, has a secret he wants no one to know about, but which eventually comes out while he is courting the daughter of the town judge. All of these characters, and several others, interact throughout the sketches.Leacock has the ability to turn a story, to make it take a crazy, unexpected twist even when you are looking for such a maneuver. That he accomplishes this in stories that rarely run longer than twenty pages is certainly a sign of great talent. By the time you reach the end of the book, you know these people as though you lived in the town yourself, and you know what makes them tick.Despite all of the crazy antics in Mariposa, Leacock never lets the reader lose sight of the fact that these are basically good people living good lives. There seems to be a lot of feeling for the citizens of Mariposa on the part of Leacock, which comes to a head in the final sketch in the collection, \\"L'Envoi. The Train to Mariposa,\\" where he recounts traveling back to the town after being away for years, with all of the attendant emotions that brings as recognizable landmarks come into view and the traveler realizes that his little town is the same as when he left it years before.I suspect there is a historical importance to \\"Sunshine Sketches of a Little Town.\\" These writings first appeared in 1912, a time when many people living in the bigger Canadian cities still remembered life in a small town. In addition to the humorous aspects of the book, the author includes many descriptive passages concerning the atmosphere and layout of Mariposa, something instantly recognizable to anyone who grew up in such a place. Nostalgia for the simpler life of the small town probably played a significant role in the book's success.I look forward to reading more Stephen Leacock. While much of the humor in the book is not belly laugh funny, it does provide one with a deep satisfaction of reading clever humor from an author who knows how to tickle the funny bone. You do not need to be Canadian to enjoy this wonderful book."},{"Title":"Sunshine Sketches of a Little Town","review":"Perhaps the finest comment about Stephen Leacock in the last half century is that &quot;he is aWill Rogers for the 90's.&quot;Rogers, of course, is one of the most beloved of American humorists -- he was killed in1935 when his plane crashed near Point Barrow, Alaska. Leacock died on March 28, 1944.Like Rogers, he had been Canada's favorite humorist for decades.Sunshine Sketches is about Orillia, Ontario, Canada, where Leacock had his summer homeon Brewery Bay (he once wrote, &quot;I have known that name, the old Brewery Bay, to makepeople feel thirsty by correspondence as far away as Nevada.&quot;) His home is now maintainedas a historic site by the town of Orillia. I lived there for almost 30 years, and the people of Orillia are still much the same as Leacock portrayed them in 1912.These stories about various personalities in town were printed in the local newspaper in the1910 - 1912 era, before being compiled into this book which established Leacock's literaryfame. The people portrayed really lived, though some are composites; the events are of akindly humorist looking at the foibles of small town life. Once they came out in book formand soared to national popularity, everyone in town figured the rest of the country waslaughing at them because of Leacock's book and he was royally hated in Orillia to the endof his life.Gradually, and this took decades, Orillians came to recognize that genius had walkedamongst them for several decades. (It's hard to recognize genius when your own ego is soinflated.) Orillia now awards the annual &quot;Leacock Medal for Humor&quot; -- Canada's top literaryprize for the best book of humour for the preceding year.Leacock died when I was six, but I did know his son, who still lived in town. I deliveredpapers to the editor of the &quot;Newspacket,&quot; Leacock's name for the Orillia Packet and Times(where I worked) and the rival Newsletter. The Packet had the same editor in the 1940's aswhen Leacock wrote about him in 1910.But the book is more than Orillia; it is a wonderfully kind and humorous description of life inmany small towns. The American artist Norman Rockwell painted the same kinds of scenes;it is the type of idyllic urban life so many of us keep longing to find again in our hecticurban world.Leacock realized the book was universal in its description of small towns, and in the prefacehe wrote &quot;Mariposa is not a real town. On the contrary, it is about seventy or eighty ofthem. You may find them all the way from Lake Superior to the sea, with the same squarestreets and the same maple trees and the same churches and hotels, and everywhere thesunshine of the land of hope.&quot;True enough, which gives this book continuing appeal nearly a century after it was written.All great writing is about topics you know, and as a longtime resident Leacock knew Orilliawell. As for Leacock himself, he wrote, &quot;I was born at Swanmoor, Hants., England, on Dec.30, 1869. I am not aware that there was any particular conjunction of the planets at thetime, but should think it extremely likely.&quot;He says of his education, &quot;I survived until I took the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in1903. The meaning of this degree is that the recipient of instruction is examined for the lasttime in his life, and is pronounced completely full. After this, no new ideas can be impartedto him.&quot;In reviewing Charles Dickens' works in 1934, Leacock wrote what could well be his ownepitaph: &quot;Transitory popularity is not proof of genius. But permanent popularity is.&quot; The facthis writings are still current illustrates the nature of his writing.In contrast to the sometimes sardonic humor of modern times, Sunshine Sketches reflectsLeacock's idea that &quot;the essence of humor is human kindness.&quot; Or, in the same vein, &quot;Humormay be defined as the kindly contemplation of the incongruities of life, and the artisticexpression thereof.&quot;Granted, this book is not what he recognized to have widespread appeal to modern readers.In his own words, &quot;There are only two subjects that appeal nowadays to the general public,murder and sex; and, for people of culture, sex-murder.&quot; Yet, anyone reading this willremember scenes from it for much longer than anything from a murder mystery.In today's world, where newspapers almost daily track Prime Minister Tony Blair's dash tothe political right, Leacock wrote, &quot;Socialism won't work except in Heaven where they don'tneed it and in Hell where they already have it.&quot;He described his own home as follows, &quot;I have a large country house -- a sort of farmwhich I carry on as a hobby . . . . Ten years ago the deficit on my farm was about ahundred dollars; but by well-designed capital expenditure and by greater attention todetails, I have got it into the thousands.&quot; Sounds familiar to today's farm policies ?It's what I mean by this being a timeless work.Leacock himself noted, when talking about good literature, &quot;Personally, I would sooner havewritten 'Alice in Wonderland' than the whole of the 'Encyclopedia Britannica'.&quot; This is his'Alice' and it well deserves to be favorably compared to Lewis Carroll's work.By all measures, it is still the finest Canadian book ever written."},{"Title":"Sunshine Sketches of a Little Town","review":"no hype. i couldn't stop laughing as i was reading this. and i mean laughing out loud. in a cafe. with everyone staring at me. but i didn't care. and i couldn't help it if i did. it's just too hilarious."},{"Title":"Sunshine Sketches of a Little Town","review":"This 1912 work uses sketches about the residents of a small Ontario lake town.

Sunshine Sketches easily exceeded such expectations. I was amazed with what skill Stephen Leacock could satirize the yokels & penny-ante frauds of his small, fictitious town, Mariposa - & yet, not generate a backlash, a reader's resentment that here was another cheap-shot artist (i.e., Jon Stewart of the Daily Show), shooting fish in a barrel.How could someone who had to make ends meet studying & teaching the principles of economics - a subject that will almost inevitably ruin any writer's creativity & wit - manage to write such wonderful comedy?A warning to those who haven't read SSLT yet - up until the chapter, \\"The Ministrations of The Rev. Mr. Drone,\\" it's smooth sailing - all low-key fun without the author touching upon the dark side of life's frustrations & tribulations.Rural Dean Drone of the \\"Church of England Church\\" then becomes the focus of the narrative, & it wasn't long before I was apprehensive that this was it - this suddenly gloomy, dour & pessimistic man's story has hijacked the book. \\"How long will this depressing drivel continue?!\\"Not for long. The detour was necessary in order to induce a sense of depression, so to speak, in order for the later renaissance of laughter to have a truer, better foundation. So if you start feeling as if you've unwillingly stumbled into F. Scott Fitzgerald's foreshadowing of eventual, gruesome tragedy, relax. Leacock knew what he was doing. All along."},{"Title":"Sunshine Sketches of a Little Town","review":"Leacock wrote in the introduction that Mariposa represented seventy or eighty different towns throughout Canada. The residents were composite characters of people he knew. Leacock did a great job of making the town seem alive. I wished I were there for the picnics, the cruises on the lake and the poker games. The plots of vignettes were good. The writing was too cute sometimes. His classical references were over my public school education at times. The characters were drawn fairly well. What the author did very well was the throw away descriptions of the characters. He would almost insult the characters he was describing in such endearing terms that I immediately felt drawn to the character.Leacock was amazing talent.

After spending considerable time selecting what you want out of life, Zig has you categorize your goals based on financial, family, spiritual, mental, personal, etc. Then, when you get done, he says something like, \\"Okay, now see if you goals are well-rounded. If they are not, then cut out some of your goals that make yourself off-balance.\\" This is difficult b/c many goals overlap, which is something he doesn't discuss. But why not have the reader select two goals from each category first??? Also, he ignores any research discussing how to deal with issues of teen sex and drug use.

True success comes from living a well rounded life and being successful in all areas of your life from family and personal relationships, to self image to money and career. I believe that this is a good overall approach to take and I found the book interesting and informative on this front.I personally believe that people often take success too seriously. Self help is ok, but just don't get all bent out of shape about it. Do what you love to do and be the best person that you can be in life. Success is not an event, but a continuing process. Ziglar makes this point in the book as well.The one annoyance I have with this book is that the author uses religion to make some of his points.

It advocates Christianity (use the bible as your business guide) and sexual abstinence as requirements for success. It uses pathetic examples and gives no real practical advice. You got to read this to believe what trash it is. A book that truly challenges the 1st Amendment! Pity I had to give it a star."},{"Title":"Success for Dummies","review":"The author states that one can get what one wants by helping others get what they want.He not from big city, is he?"},{"Title":"Success for Dummies","review":"If you're new to Zig Ziglar books and tapes, than this is one I highly recommend for starters. It summarizes all of Zig's 70 plus years of experience and is layed down in a format that is simple and easy to understand. It also includes most of the material that is covered in other of Zig's bestselling books, such as Over the Top, How to be a Winner and so on. It's a book truly worth owning!."},{"Title":"Success for Dummies","review":"I decided to check this book out of the library at a time in my life when I couldn't decide what I wanted to do in life. I had been out of college for two years, and couldn't seem to find a job in my field since I moved to Ga., despite my interviews. I was exploring different fields related to Special Ed. It sounds weird but, somehow while reading this book, I just knew what I was suppossed to be doing. Due to the series of questions he asked you about your goals. I highly reccomend this book to any one who can't decide where to go in life. Zig, told me that I wasn't really &quot;lost&quot; I just needed to find some direction in life. He was so right! I guess I just needed someone to tell me to wake up and decide what I was going to do with the rest of my life instead fo just subing all the time. Ironically, enough he guided me back on track to Special Ed, when I read the story about the man who found himself going back to the same career he used to do. I guess I just needed someone to tell me that for my life to feel on track, I needed to enroll in the TAPP (teacher alternative program), and be a Special Ed teacher instead of just being the aid like always. I really feel like God wanted me to find this book at this time in my life. True, Zig is relgious, but even if you aren't I feel like anyone could benift from his book. It has quite a few &quot;duh&quot; moments that a lot of people never think of. I have been hearing about Zig ever since I was like 9 or 10 and had always wanted to go to his seminars, but never had the chance. It is so true about what people think about him! Thanks Zig!"},{"Title":"Success for Dummies","review":"This book covers all areas of life that people need to address to be successful. I appreciated his coverage of the importance of spirituality. Although he is a mainstream Christian, he makes clear that spirituality can be found in other religions as well.The only thing I disagreed with were his comments about obedience being vital to success. I don't believe in absolute obedience. Obdience to organizations and authority figures should be relative. For example, if you have a religious authority figure who wants you to do something unethical or immoral, you should follow your conscience and remain obedient to God's law as found in the Bible. Human beings do not deserve absolute obedience as they are imperfect and prone to mistakes.Also, I thought he used too many examples of famous people in sports as positive examples. I do not play golf and couldn't care less about sports, but I still tried to find the positive in his statements (such as the value of personal integrity, the value of working together as a team, etc.) Is the person who is not rich or famous unsuccessful?"},{"Title":"Success for Dummies","review":"Zig covers all the bases in this book. Full of good stories and solid principles, Success For Dummies is worth reading and re-reading. It is laid out like all the Dummies books, so you can read small portions at a time, or browse through it and read what you want for now. It's fun to read and teaches a lot. I thought it was a surprisingly big book for only 17 dollars! I'm the author of the book, Self-Help Stuff That Works, and I can tell you, as an expert in the field, Zig teaches what works!"},{"Title":"Success for Dummies","review":"I did not purchase this book necessarily because I was searching for success, but because I knew it would be an interesting read. I truly enjoyed reading Success For Dummies because it was entertaining and helpful at the same time. Some self-help books are packed with too much information, too many strategies or just not arranged in a readable fashion. I knew I could rely on the For Dummies publishers to present the information in a way that would keep me reading. Zig Ziglar brings the reader in and through anecdotal evidence from his own life, convinces the reader he too, can succeed. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who is on the road to success and needs a little encouragement and entertainment along the way."},{"Title":"Success for Dummies","review":"This book is an inspirational roadmap in a well balanced and successful life. Zig Ziglar draws upon a wealth of personal experience to illustrate the importance of balancing the various parts of out lives to attain to true success, not just material success. The fault I find with this book is that its subject matter is not a good fit for the &quot;For Dummies&quot; format. Success in life is not a subject you can pick and choose, which is the essence of the &quot;For Dummies&quot; concept. This is a good book, but be prepared to read it cover to cover to derive the greatest benefit."},{"Title":"Success for Dummies","review":"There are a few books I think should be required reading for school children. This book is one of them. Not only should this book be required reading in schools, but in corporations as well. I would hope that reading would lead to study, and then application of the principals Zig presents. As Zig states early in the book, you don't have to apply what he is going to share. But it is of immense value to at least consider what he shares. Please take the time to read this book at least once. It will be worth many times what you spend."},{"Title":"Success for Dummies","review":"The words you say and the words you think do become the life you have. Success principles for all areas of life can be learned by anyone with an open mind and an open heart and Zig Zigler does try to help. In the words of the author: Most people think of success in terms of business and financial wealth but the real key to success means having a balanced life."},{"Title":"Success for Dummies","review":"No other book is needed. This is the ONLY guide you'll need to be happy, successful, and content in life.Zig, you ARE the best.Thanks you for a great masterpiece."},{"Title":"Success for Dummies","review":"After visiting Zig Ziglar.com and signing up for a free newletter, I entered a contest. What I won was more than just a free book. It was Mr. Ziglar's \\"Success for Dummies\\". No matter where you are in life, if your not satisfied - this is the book for you. He doesn't just entertain and lift your spirits and expectations(and he does this thoroughly), he gives you the pattern to fulfill your plan. God Bless Zig Ziglar - I am now living the plan."},{"Title":"High Wizardry: Young Wizard Series, Book 3","review":"The Wizardry series was intended to be a trilogy at first, this being the third and final book. It shows - but the events here lead up perfectly to the fourth novel.In it, Nita Callahan's bratty but highly intelligent sister Dairine takes the Wizard's Oath without realising what she's getting into and, with a software version of the wizard's manual, finds herself on a journey into deep space - with the Lone Power itself chasing her. As Nita faces up to many changes in her life, she and Kit follow her to a strange planet where an alien intelligence, locked in a planetary computer chip, has been waiting indefinitely for a sentient being to wake it up. Dairine, of course, has never baulked at anything but when she gives the motherboard access to wizardry, the story rises to a stunning climax with a totally unexpected twist. You may think it's unbelieveable, but remember the youngest wizards have the most power . . .A brilliantly constructed piece of storytelling, thoroughly enjoyable - all the more so when you discover there is a fourth book in the series."},{"Title":"High Wizardry: Young Wizard Series, Book 3","review":"After reading So You Want To Be a Wizard and Deep Wizardry, the first two books in the Young Wizards series, and enjoying them, I expected High Wizardry to be really good, but not this good. High Wizardry is very well written, and the story is exciting and original. It kept me reading as fast as I could until the end, when I felt horrible because the book was over. The story has no lack of action, unlike Deep Wizardry, which got a little boring and repetitive after a while. It shows a new way for wizardry to work, through a laptop computer, and also what what a wizard can do when a they have almost limitless power. It also shows a species making its Choice (what it will do about the Lone Power and entropy), which is nice because the readers never actually got to witness a Choice before. I got a look at Ms. Duane's idea of aliens and alien planets for the first time, which were not only very original but also hysterically funny. The climax was wonderful, and wrapped the story up nicely.I actually like it that Dairine is the main character of this book, even though Nita and Kit have less of a part. I find her more interesting and fun to read about than Nita, because she stands out to me from all the other characters I've read about. Nita seems a little boring to me, and Dairine has more character, which is necessary for a good story. After reading A Wizard Abroad and A Wizard's Dilemma, both of shich hardly included Dairine, I was very happy to see her getting a bigger part in Wizard's Holiday. Without her, I wouldn't have laughed nearly as much, and I found myself actually admiring her determination. Personally, I've never liked a character more.High Wizardry and the other Young Wizards books all make a wonderful guess at the answer to the \\"life and death\\" question. The idea that all the bad things in the world could possibly be fixed, if the Power that made them could be persuaded to change, is an optimistic idea, and I often find myself wishing that Ms. Duane's world were real.High Wizardry is a great book for anyone who wants to read an amazing, thrilling mix of fantasy and science fiction. I'm thirteen, but my dad read it and he liked it, too. I recommend reading So You Want To Be A Wizard and Deep Wizardry first, because this is the third book in the series, or else it might be confusing. Aside from that, if you're wondering if you should read this book, or the Young Wizards series in general, definitely do it. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"High Wizardry: Young Wizard Series, Book 3","review":"I *LOVE* this series! Here in High Wizardry, we spend some time with Dairine's Ordeal, and the deeper nature of Macchu Picchu (Peach to her...friends) is at last revealed. Where the &quot;So You Want To Be A Wizard&quot; was largely about action, and &quot;Deep Wizardry&quot; was more interpersonal development and self-realisation for Kit and Nita, this one switches to bring Dairine in, and is much more about Kit and Nita's emotional relationship. I especially love the scene on the Moon, before they set off. Gigo is one of the best new characters (until Neet's aunt), Peach gets a great scene, but don't think this is the end of the line for our favourite wizards!"},{"Title":"High Wizardry: Young Wizard Series, Book 3","review":"I really enjoyed So You Want to be a Wizard and absolutely adored Deep Wizardry; however, I found this book somewhat lacking. I thought the first half was pretty good, in which Darianne gets herself into a mess because she doesn't realize the responsibility that she is undertaking. However, I thought Duane should have continued the moralitly tale angle. Instead Darianne stumbles onto a deserted planet, converts it into a giant motherboard, and begins a new creation.I thought that Duane lost herself a bit in the climax of the story. It was comforting to achieve such a victory for the wizards, but I thought it all went a little too fast. Darianne changed from irresponsible brat to mother figure entirely too quickly and I just couldn't buy the transition.Furthermore, I think the characters of Kit and Nita are more fully developed and intersting to follow. Darianne was a really interesting side character in the first two novels, but she couldn't hold my interest throughout the entire book."},{"Title":"High Wizardry: Young Wizard Series, Book 3","review":"It should come as no surprise that Dairine, Juanita Callahan's sister, was due to become a wizard herself. What no one expected though was that Dairine would peek into Nita's manual and take the Oath herself. Without even reading the small print. Suddenly an 11-year-old human is one of the most powerful wizards in the universe, and the powers that be have some surprising plans for her. In short order she turns her brand new computer into the perfect spell assistant and heads off. First, a trial spin to Mars, and then whoosh! - She's off to her own ordeal.Dairine quickly discovers that she is being chased by the powers of darkness. In a mad run, she covers billions of light years until she finally comes to rest in what appears to be a dead planet composed of layer after layer of silicon. But appearances can be deceiving and Dairine discovers that the planet has become a giant computer chip, hovering on the edge of sentience. The young wizard and her trusty Apple III are the catalyst. Since Dairine is teaching the planet first to think, and then to create. Soon she is surrounded by silicon creatures, creatures to whom she has given the gift of magic, without considering the consequences.To each culture comes the lone power, the one that created death. And to each he offers a choice to accept his gift or choose otherwise. Never before has it been rejected right from the start, and it has no intention of this being the first time. A great argument is begun. But nothing is certain, especially around Dairine, and she and the Lone Power are quickly locked in a battle of logic and heart. And coming up behind as fast as they can are Kit and Nita. Three wizards facing a battle that could determine the future of the universe - and kill them just as easily.While none of Duane's Wizardry series are slow reading, High Wizardry goes by in a great flash, with a memorable ending. The book has much to say about behaving responsibly and accepting help, but it never preaches. Dairine may be a hero, but she still has much to learn, and that's the lesson she takes home with her. And Nita comes face to face with her own resentments towards a sister who is both younger than her and a better wizard. The book has a lesson for everyone it seems, even the Lone Power.\\"Never think We were made to be less than equals in the One. Someday you will surpass Us, and still be our equals, and both you and We will rejoice at it.\\""},{"Title":"High Wizardry: Young Wizard Series, Book 3","review":"Probably the emotional high point of the series, this book culminates in a great fiasco that spans the entire universe in its scope. It is mostly science fiction, but it takes a stronger look at the Christian mythos that the series has in the background of all the characters. Nita and Kit are played down a great deal, with Dairine stealing most of the \\"screen time.\\" For some this may be a let down, but how often can you do the same thing over and over again. I argue that this should be the last book in the series, since the next two books in the wizardry series never succeed in topping the dramatic events of this one."},{"Title":"High Wizardry: Young Wizard Series, Book 3","review":"A character who has constantly been in the background of the first two books in this series, \\"So You Want to Be a Wizard\\" and \\"Deep Wizardry,\\" has been Juanita (Nita) Callahan's younger sister Dairine. While Dairine has been a pest, as younger sisters (and brothers) often seem to be, Diane Duane was setting up Dairine for a special role. A role Dairine gets a chance to fill in this book.We discover early in this book that Dairine is an incredibly power wizard; much more powerful than either Nita or her best friend Christopher (Kit) Rodriguez. Dairine's book of magic comes not in the traditional form of a book, but as a lap top computer, reflecting the improving state-of-the-art of computers in 1990 when Duane wrote this book. Of course any computer owned by a wizard would have to be strange, and Dairine's computer exhibits characteristics that are decidedly different from any computer we mere mortals have experienced.Dairine's Ordeal matches her incredible power. She is tasked to bring an entire planet to self-realization and advancement to a higher state of consciousness and she takes on the Lone Power with the support of her newly created and found friends. I leave the details to the reader.This book has a different flavor from the first two books in the series. While the first two books had technology, this book exhibits a stronger science fiction or science fantasy influence. Even with that influence the fate of the Lone Power remains strongly metaphysical and just a touch incongruous with the science fiction nature of the story. The ending of the story relates, as with the previous two books, to the fate of the Lone Power, and thus must be metaphysical, and the ending confuses much of the effort Diane put into developing the science fiction aspect of the story.Excluding the ending, this book is a captivating read and further develops the characters in the series. While the second book stands acceptably well on its own, I recommend reading at least the first book in the series, \\"So You Want to Be a Wizard,\\" prior to reading this book. Knowing the principal characters is helpful in coming up to speed with the storyline.This book is another good entry in this series, but with a different flavor. A solid four stars."},{"Title":"High Wizardry: Young Wizard Series, Book 3","review":"High Wizardry is undoubtedly Duane at the top of her game. The characters are more complex than one anticipates in a young adult fantasy novel, and the writing more involved. Unambiguously some of Duane's very best work; High Wizardry is emotionally involving, thought provoking, intelligent, and well-informed, but in no sense a burden or chore to read."},{"Title":"High Wizardry: Young Wizard Series, Book 3","review":"The first time I ever knew that this series existed was when my mom brought home High Wizardry from the library. I was (and am) a Harry Potter nut, and she thought it might be of some interest to me. I picked it up at about 2:00 pm and didn't put it down till dinnertime. The book was fantastic, even though I still didn't know the first two existed.I got about halfway through it, and it became too confusing. I didn't know who the Lone Power was (yikes) and didn't even understand the whole concept of this type of wizardry. I was clueless. So, one night, I left it on the table, and my mom (thinking I was done with it) took it back to the library.About six months later, I was in a bookstore and the first book, So you want to be a Wizard, caught my eye. I bought it, and devoured it in about two days. Then I bought Deep Wizardry, and devoured that, too. I was excited then- remembering how good High Wizardry was and thinking it would be a lot better than it was when I read it the first time.It was.That's an understatement.I was captivated. I would not leave my book alone for more than five minutes. This book held me in its pages like none other has ever done. I stayed up hours past my bedtime, carefully eluding my mom's attempts to catch me reading.At school the next day, I got told off a few times for reading when I wasn't supposed to. (oops) There was one boy who even made fun of the title. (Oh, I get it! She's high on wizardry!)High Wizardry is the best book I have ever read. The last half is incredibly written and had me sitting on the edge of my chair. A few days of sorrow happened after I finished it- I had nothing to read... One last comment- do NOT read this book unless you have read the first two. It will (in the end) do nothing more than confuse you."},{"Title":"High Wizardry: Young Wizard Series, Book 3","review":"Nita has known about wizardry for a while.

With the help of a Wizard's Manual Laptop, Dairine finally gets the freedom she's dreamed of: she leaves Earth and heads out to explore the galaxy. Dairine thinks she's on a little vacation, but if she is on vacation, why are evil creatures following her? Why do the beautiful creatures she's created want to freeze all life forms?

Besides being a gripping fantasy, Duane weaves in most of the concepts taught by our science teacher.

There was a number of reasons for this.Firstly Dairane did not make a good viewpoint character, and she did not change or develop in any way. She starts as an overconfident brat and ends that way as well. Int the long run making her come to terms with not becoming a wizard would have made for a much more interesting character then what we got, the Super Brat who can take on the Lone power head on and win.In this book magic does not have a price, Even Nita and Kit approach things like pulp action heros rather then the children they are. There is no fear, no doubt that they will win, and no price to be paid at the end.By the end of the book the battle against entropy, which cannot be won, has been won. leaving behind nothing but shadows of evil.This time I'm not rushing to get to the next book, They have defeated the main event, what trouble could the shadows cause?There was nothing to make me keep reading here, no suspense, no danger, Nothing more then pulp action. And in the end I found myself pulled out of the world of the story. My suspension of disbelief broken as the very laws of the Universe that Duane took pains to create were undone in a single chapter."},{"Title":"High Wizardry: Young Wizard Series, Book 3","review":"This is the third book in the Wizardry series. This book focuses on Dairine, Nita's little sister. Dairine has always wanted to have magic in her life, so that she could go out and defeat the Darth Vaders of the universe. When she found out that her sister is a wizard, she wants to be able to do magic, too. When her family's new computer arrives, Dairine discovers that it can help her do magic. Her obsession with Star Wars inspires her to visit other planets, and the aliens chasing after her force her to travel to planets even farther away than those. Although Nita and Kit are searching for her, Dairine has to learn how to use her new magic before the Lone Power catches up with her. Her adventures will teach her that magic isn't just for fun and games.I really liked this book. Although there was more tech talk than I would have liked, I still feel like I followed along fairly well. It was really interesting, seeing how Dairine's mind works. She's definitely different from her sister. Her explorations of other planets were very vivid, and I really enjoyed those parts. The only real problem I had with this book was the end. Near the end, everything seemed to get very confusing, and it was not nearly as easy to understand what was going on. It would've been nice if the ending had been clearer.

Not only is Dairine far too smart for a ten-year-old, she also has recently become a wizard, and worse yet, a wizard with almost limitless power. When Dairine's computerized wizard's manual glibly sends her off on her novice adventure-her Ordeal-Kit and Nita end up chasing her across the galaxy, trying to catch up with Dairine before she gets into trouble so deep that not even her brains can rescue her.I read this book because there was some interesting parts in it. I liked this book because Dairine accidentally went on a big computer chip, and faced the Lone Power by herself. I read this book because I am interested in wizardry. I am a huge fan of wizardry books.My favorite part of the book was when Dairine fought the Lone Power by herself. She had love, saving her sister and Kit. Then after, Picchu,(Peach), had transferred from a bird to a human, Dairine and company went home. Her computer grew legs! I liked this part of the book."},{"Title":"High Wizardry: Young Wizard Series, Book 3","review":"This was a awesome book, that focused a lot of it's attention on Dairine, Nita's annoying younger sister. Since I myself have an eleven year old brother who irritates me quite a lot (though I'll admit he's not as bad as Dairine) I found myself truly resenting Dairine's character in the other books. But, since this book told a lot of the story from her point of view, I began to dislike her less, and finally in the end I realized I identified with her quite a bit. This book was definitely the best in the series, both in character development and in writing quality. The Lone Power is such a cool foe!

Duane treads far into the \\"rational fantasy\\" territory of Madeline L'Engle here; in fact, the book in places seems to be a direct homage to _A Wrinkle in Time_ with its rapid planet-hopping and planets based on philosophy. I'm tempted to call this science fiction or at least science fantasy.In a major shift, the hero of the story is Nita's little sister, Dairine, who has a knack for computer wizardry. The humor that was subtle in the previos novel, _Deep Wizardry_, returns in full force here for the first half-Dairine makes for a very humorous heroine. But toward the end the book bogs down in its own half-explained philosophy. This confusing finale keeps the book from obtaining the thrilling heights of the first two."},{"Title":"High Wizardry: Young Wizard Series, Book 3","review":"I really liked the first two wizardry books, so this one was a bad disappointment. The fanasty world of the first two seemed to have turned into a science fiction universe which was boring and unimaginative. The story was hard to follow and it was very annoying having Dairine as the main character as I never liked her and didn't want her to become a wizard. Rather then this bad end to a good trilogy I would prefer to think of So You Want to Be a Wizard and Deep Wizardry as a book and its sequel. The only reason I finished this book is because I wanted to read the whole trilogy-otherwise, it just wasn't intresting."},{"Title":"High Wizardry: Young Wizard Series, Book 3","review":"This is a great book to introduce you to Duane's work.

I had to wait a looooooong time before we went to Indy again, but when we did, I got the 2nd book. It was great. The next week, we went to Bloomington (a 3 hr looooong drive), where we went to their [local bookstore]. I saw the 3rd book, and I had to get it. (I also got The Chrestomanci Chronicles, Volume 2, which is a great book for other fantasy nuts.) We were going to a bunch of early music concerts, so I read in the car, at the restaurant, and before the concert because the book was so good. I finished it in one day, and I read the preview in the back of the book. Bigggg mistake!!! Now I want the next book reallllly bad!!!!! (A good thing I had The Chrestomanci Chronicles, Volume 2 to take my mind off of the next books.)Anyway, if you haven't read this book you should , even if you aren't a fantasy nut.

WIth a shock Dairine realizes her responsibilities as creator, and attempts at almost mortal cost to save her creation from the wrong choice.

Nita and Kit are more likable characters by far than Dairine, and I'm afraid that I don't understand why she needed a novel focusing on her. Why not a novel with a focus on Kit? Dairine's expertise in everything gave me a deeper appreciation of the other characters, who try hard, have flaws, have interesting relationships, and have limitations in their abilities, as opposed to a better understanding of Dairine as a person and a character. This book is good... but not the best in this wonderful series."},{"Title":"High Wizardry: Young Wizard Series, Book 3","review":"A quick plot summary (note that I haven't read any of the other books): Dairine, Nita's younger sister and a child progidy, took the Oath and is now going to go to her ordeal. I feel doubtful about how the whole magic system (Ordeals etc) would ever hold together, but never mind for now.Writing style: Nothing special. Undescriptive language, and I can see that at some points Diane Duane is hooked upon confusing readers beyond hope, but pick up enough non-fiction books and you will know what is being talked about and you'll even be able to spot the nonsense when the teleport spell is being cast! (Well, it's quite easy...)To those who claim the books are educational: Quite simply, they aren't. Diane Duane talks about topics which don't come up on school syllabuses (entropy) and then oversimplifies them so that you think you understand them or just writes lots of intelligent-sounding nonsense. They have random facts, but I doubt most people will remember the name of one of Saturn's moons just because it is mentioned.The main problems with the book are that, a) that parrot - what on earth was she thinking? (to those who've already read the book) and b) Dairine is simply too intelligent. No sane human being could name all the named characters in Lord of the Rings, all 50 states and their capitals, and all the past presidents and *particularly* not somebody who isn't even smoking anything. Her only fault through the whole book, however, is a very well-chosen one and you can find her admitting it in the airport chapters. Oh, and c) throughout the whole book, there are only about 5 times I laughed, maybe less. d) Diane Duane writes sentimental scenes very badly in this book and thankfully they are at a minimum.

Diane Duane does not usually give easy answers to her moral dilemmas but in this story both the dilemma and the story were too easy and the story dragged down by the rather overtly gooey overtone.As a convicted Christian I find the idea that the 'lone power' ie satan can be redeemed repellent- this stuff is poisoning kid's minds.

If the theology/morality wasn't so pointless, affectated and plain ridiculous (more on that in a second), it would still be a crime against humanity on the part of the publishers.The writing style is banal, flat and unimaginative, the characterisation is poorly thought out and unbelievable (Dairine suddenly transforms into a different person halfway through the book, and the parrot/goddess...don't get me started. Nita and Kit are as they always were, in their ways and in their relations with each other, and the Lone Power, unbelievably, goes through a completely ludicrous character change.) Also, it has a falsely sentimental overtone, the jokes are childish and- well, it just ... all round.About the theology.

You've gotta love Dairine. She's eleven years old, a genius who enjoys solving equations, a Star Wars-obsessed preteen, and -- oh yes. A wizard.Ever since she discovered her sister Nita's Art, she's been desperate to get it for herself. And little Dari can't just wait for the Powers That Be to present the opportunity to her. Of course not. Instead she finds Nita's wizards' manual and takes the Oath herself...right before being plunged straight into Ordeal, the test of initiation all wizards have to undergo before they begin errantry -- and for for atypical Dairine, the Powers have devised an atypical Ordeal, which involves nothing short of intergalactic planet-hopping with a wizards' laptop, until finally landing on an empty planet made almost entirely of silicon...In other words, a computer chip. A big, planetary, intelligent computer chip.And so her computer gets to work trying to communicate with the Motherboard, as the planet is called, and soon the planet's awareness is stimulated. Aliens with the minds of computers emerge, all of them wizards thanks to Dairine's intervention, and now comes the challenge that constitutes Dairine's Ordeal, the real reason she's here...For in the beginning of all species' existence, the Lone Power, inventor of death and entropy, comes to try to sell Its invention. And this computer species is no exception. Now Dairine, fighting not against Darth Vader but against the Lone One, fighting not with lightsabers but with logic, has to convince her \\"children\\" not to accept the Lone One's offer to stop the universe and thus cease entropy. She has to convince them not to repeat the Garden of Eden-like mistake her race, and all the others, have made before -- and if she fails, all of her \\"children\\" will die.I liked High Wizardry better than any of the other books in this series, though The Wizard's Dilemma and Wizards at War come really, really close. I love Dairine as a character, and though the series has some odd contradictions throughout it (the difference between Nita's and Dairine's Oaths, Dairine being described as a great sister in the first and a brat in the third, etc.) it is great as a whole.

Nita said.'Trouble?' said the Stationmaster, and led them off across the bright floor and showed them the place where several large pieces of the ceiling had been shot down. 'Trouble?' it said, pointing out the places where the floors were melted, indicating the blaster scars in the kiosks and the large cordoned-off area where maintenance people of various species were scraping and scrubbing coffee-ground-smelling residue off the floor. 'Oh, no trouble. Not really.'\\"- at the Crossings on Rirhath B, hereinAt a minimum, read SO YOU WANT TO BE A WIZARD (which introduces Nita, Kit, and to a lesser extent Nita's sister Dairine) before tackling this book. Ideally, you should also read DEEP WIZARDRY first, in which Nita's family found out that she's a wizard.HIGH WIZARDRY differs from the earlier volumes in the series in that Nita and Kit, while present and even leading off as viewpoint characters, are not the focus. The main character is Nita's younger sister Dairine, who as the story opens - on the day their parents have just taken delivery of a new computer - has just got hold of Nita's manual, said the Oath, and is waiting for something to happen. Dairine, in fact, becomes one of the first human wizards to receive the beta-test version of the wizards' manual on a computer instead of in book form, so (as with each of the previous two books) we have another way of accessing wizardry being introduced.The beta-test version of the wizards' manual. Think about that for a moment. This would be trouble even if a new-made wizard *didn't* face an Ordeal after taking the Oath, the problem for which he or she is a solution. Furthermore, since the youngest wizards are least likely to hesitate before attempting the supposedly impossible, wizards' Ordeals tend to deal with the toughest problems. And Dairine, just to make life interesting, would like to grow up to be a Jedi knight; she immediately dives into the bits of the manual that'll let her *really* travel. And thanks to the new version of the manual, it's set up in such a way that the wizard can access it without necessarily fully understanding how a spell will operate; she just has to be able to specify what she wants to do.HIGH WIZARDRY puts me in mind of CS Lewis' PERELANDRA, because the core problem that Dairine faces in her ordeal is that of a world whose newly awakened inhabitants - essentially intelligent machines - face their first critical Choice that will determine how their species' history will play out. And how does one explain to an AI that fixing the bugs in the universe is not necessarily a good idea?"},{"Title":"High Wizardry: Young Wizard Series, Book 3","review":"...at first because I liked the idea of Nita having an edge over her sister.

This work, a revision of the author's Ph.D. thesis completed at the University of South Florida, has much information that is not commonly known, such as many of the forerunners of the ID movement were atheists or agnostics. For example, the role of such people as Murray Eden (professor emeritus at MIT) and other ID forerunners such as Professor Michael Denton (p. 24) are discussed. Many excellent quotes are included that show the dogmatic attitude of the Darwinists, such as Gould's statement to Professor Johnson calling him (falsely) a creationist and then emotionally proclaiming \\"I've got to stop\\" your work, obviously by any means he can (p. 96). This is hardly the attitude of an objective scientist intent on searching for the truth about origins. Woodward, a college professor himself, documents the many unethical attacks by the so called science and university establishment against those who dare to question Darwin. Rarely are Darwin doubters given an opportunity to respond to attacks against them in the journals that published the attacks and, thus, few people have an objective understanding of the movement. Reading sections of this book at times made me ashamed to be a scientist. Woodward does note that many scientists have been objective and fair critics, even supportive of ID, such as University of Chicago Professor David Raup (I was a fan of his work long before I learned about his positive contribution's to ID). The book also tries to answer questions such as, why more and more people are having serious doubts about Darwinism, who they are, and why the ID movement is growing so fast. The motive for the growth of ID is clearly major \\"doubts about Darwinism\\" and the book covers these in some detail. Now what is needed is an objective book on ID by a professional historian."},{"Title":"Doubts About Darwin: A History of Intelligent Design","review":"... One oft-repeated story is that all challenges to Darwinism are merely religiously motivated and hopelessly unscientific. Science is about objective facts. Religion is about subjective values. Darwinism is scientific. Challenges to Darwinism are not scientific and so have no place in any public institution. This standard story is being upended by lawyers, scientists, and philosophers who claim that Darwinism fails the tests of good science. These thinkers, who are neither theologians nor preachers, make up the Intelligent Design (ID) movement, which is chronicled in this important book written by a professor at Trinity College in Florida.Woodward's account shows that the problem with the template of \\"religion versus Darwin\\" is that it simply doesn't fit the ID movement, although many detractors try to insist otherwise. The founder of the movement, Phillip Johnson, was, until his recent retirement, a Professor of Law at the University of California at Berkeley. While on sabbatical in the late 1980s, he studied the scientific case for and against Darwinism and concluded that the empirical case for Darwinism was surprisingly weak. He then presented his findings at a symposium held through his law school and was further encouraged to pursue his criticism of Darwinism. As Woodward amply documents, the proponents of this movement-which include a biochemist (Michael Behe) as well as a philosopher of mathematics (William Dembski)-have \\"doubts about Darwin\\" based on their investigation of the empirical evidence. Proponents of ID argue that Darwinism lacks crucial evidence, begs important questions, and often caricatures alternatives unfairly. ...The proponents of ID make their case against Darwinian evolution by pointing out flaws in the arguments and gaps in the evidence, not by citing religious texts. ..Rather, ID thinkers are a diverse group united primarily in their belief that Darwinism is not beyond the reach of scientific criticism. ... Chance and necessity alone, they argue, do not provide sufficient scientific categories for explaining the origin of complex living systems such as DNA and the bacterial flagellum (a microscopic rotary motor). The scientific and philosophical establishment is beginning to interact seriously with ID claims in academic journals and at conferences, although it is still often dismissed as \\"unscientific.\\"There are a growing number of books defending and criticizing ID, but Woodward's book is unique in that it assesses the history of this movement of the past decade-or-so from the perspective of the classical discipline of rhetoric. Given the book's rhetorical angle, the reader is treated to both the straight arguments for and against Darwinism, as well as an inside look at the personalities and persuasive strategies used on both sides of the debate. (For example, when noted Darwinist Stephen Jay Gould first met Phillip Johnson, he dispensed with pleasantries and said, \\"You're a creationist and I've got to stop you.\\") In Woodward's account, Johnson emerges as the rhetorical mastermind of ID, who, though an outsider to the scientific guild, nevertheless mastered the scientific case against Darwinism and helped develop a consistent strategy for the ID movement. His simple charge is that Darwinism is driven more by a commitment to a materialistic worldview than by the actual evidence of biology. If one admits the category of intelligent design back into science, the case for Darwinism crumbles-or so Johnson claims.While Woodward is a friend of the Intelligent Design movement, he lets the thinkers speak for themselves and is neither partisan nor unfair. Rather, without getting too technical, he frames the debate in terms of rhetorical strategies employed. In this way, the reader can discover the larger intellectual, historical, emotional, and cultural contours of this growing debate-which, I wager, is not about to go away any time soon.--Douglas Groothuis, Ph.D., is Professor of Philosophy at Denver Seminary and the author of \\"On Pascal.\\""},{"Title":"Doubts About Darwin: A History of Intelligent Design","review":"This book makes two important contributions to the contemporary Darwin vs. design controversy: 1) it chronicles the history of the growing acknowledgment of the scientific deficiencies of neo-Darwinian evolution and the rise of intelligent design theory, and 2) it also provides a unique, rhetorical analysis of the works of Michael Denton, Phillip Johnson, Michael Behe and William Dembski.Whereas Larry Witham's recent book \\"By Design\\" takes a more neutral tone and extends his narrative to include debates over cosmic design, Dr. Thomas Woodward is more sympathetic with the arguments and ideas of the proponents of the theory of intelligent design, and his book focuses more narrowly upon the issue of biological evolution. But this in no way detract from the book's credibility and effectiveness. Rather, Woodward's work has much to its credit and any serious reader should evaluate the history and analysis he provides on the merits.One need not have read the works of Denton, Johnson, Behe and Dembski to be able to follow Woodward's analysis, but a familiarity with the primary design proponents' books and arguments will enhance one's appreciation for the analysis he provides. Woodward also points out the importance of Charles Thaxton and his ideas for the development of intelligent design theory, and likewise provides readers with a concise introduction to rhetoric of science as an important intellectual field.If I had to be picky, I would say that this book is not entirely clear about the fact that there are critics of neo-Darwinian evolution, such as David Berlinski, whom one may not necessarily consider to be a proponent of intelligent design theory. Such a skeptic of Darwin might be more properly considered to be outside of the \\"Intelligent Design Movement.\\"The 1999 Kansas State Board of Education battle features so prominently in the early part of the book. It is true that this episode helped to give intelligent design theory and its main proponents much early publicity, but the main design proponents were not deeply involved in matters there. Leading proponents of design were much more active in the Ohio controversy of 2001-2002, which involved a more clear and careful approach to the teaching of Darwin's theory and a much more favorable result was ultimately obtained: while merely permitting local schools to include discussion of the theory of intelligent design, the State Board of Education adopted a benchmark requiring students to know why scientists continue to investigate and critically analyze aspects of evolutionary theory.In any case, this book is quite enjoyable and is recommended to readers. I initially gave this book 4 stars, but after further contemplation of the books merits and after following all of the accounts about the debates surrounding these issues, I have concluded that Woodward brings far more clarity to the issues at stake. At this point, I can only hope that Woodward will write a sequel, analyzing the history and main arguments presented by the anti-design crowd."},{"Title":"Doubts About Darwin: A History of Intelligent Design","review":"Doubts about Darwin is the first objective full length book about the Intelligent Design Movement (ID). The book is a revision of the author's Ph.D. thesis completed at the University of South Florida. The author is a college professor (as I am).

It is obvious that many people who write about ID do not have an accurate understanding of the movement. The motive for the growth of ID is clearly \\"doubts about Darwinism\\" and the book covers these in some detail. This work will be the standard work in this area for some time to come."},{"Title":"Doubts About Darwin: A History of Intelligent Design","review":"I am tired of reading reviews that rate the book simply based upon the reviewers bias whether it be pro-evolution or against. For that reason, I have found it necessary to write a review that actually discusses the contents of the book.Doubts was originally Thomas Woodward's doctoral thesis which was then turned into a book. He seeks to explain the origins of the ID movement. He makes it clear that one of his main goals is to show that ID is based on sound scientific data rather than an attempt to repackage creationism, as it is often accused. I picked up this book because I was hoping for a unbiased approach to ID. I was hoping to first read a book without any bias that could set the stage for future study. Unfortunately, that is not what I found in Doubts. It's quite possible that I may never find a book of this nature with such a polarizing topic as evolution.I will first tell the things that I like about Doubts. Although I believe that evolution should be taught, I do have a number of doubts regarding it. There are a lot of issues that have not yet been settled in my mind regarding its truthfulness. I agree with the ID people in that there doesn't seem to be enough transitional fossils. I can understand how a wolf and a dog might be related, or even a dog and a cat, but I find it difficult to relate an animal with a fully-functioning digestive system with an animal like an earthworm. Doubts succeeded in presenting even more such issues. In truth, Doubts did not present any issues, but rather it spoke of the issues brought forth by others such as Behe, Johnson, and Denton (to name but a few). I definitely have a lot of questions that beg to be answered by the Darwinists.Doubts also succeeded in bringing to light the dogmatic nature displayed by some of the Darwinists. It is unfortunate, but clearly evident, that some scientists use Darwinism as a method of justifying their atheism. If scientists forward a view/theory based not on empirical evidence but rather upon philosophical predilection, then they are guilty of the same dogmatism they decry in the creationists. When scientists start pushing atheism, they have left the realm of science and entered into the realm of religion. Science is ill-equipped at dealing with the existence or non-existence of deity. Previously, I was under the impression that scientists generally observed this delineation, but Doubts has caused me to question whether science is doing a good enough job of minding its own business.Lastly, Doubts succeeds in pointing out the key issue of this whole debate. Ultimately, the question is the axiom of naturalism held by science. Naturalism requires that science only investigate natural cause and effect. Naturalism precludes science from making theories that involve deity, for deity lies outside of this natural sphere. The ID movement claims that naturalism impedes science and that non-naturalist theories should be allowed. Evolution finds this to be ridiculous. But ultimately, that is the issue at stake.Having given my positive views of Doubts, I ultimately feel that it is a poor book. Since it was adapted from a doctoral dissertation, it suffers from the thick over-inflated writing style that is so common in the scientific community. Things that could have been stated in a few simple words are expressed in a long string of obfuscated gibberish. The author finds it necessary to constantly explain the value of analogy and various other methods of rhetoric ad nauseum.Poor writing is excusable, especially in a scholarly work, but blatant bias is not excusable. Woodward claims to be writing an unbiased history of ID, but one needs not dig too deep to find his strong pro-ID bias. Again and again I was approached with examples of Woodward presenting rebuttals by the ID movement while failing to give the Darwinists the same opportunity. Successes of ID were inflated with superlatives while their failures were glazed over as quickly as possible as if one of his doctoral had required he include their mention. I can never trust a work that claims to be unbiased when they can admit no fault with one side, yet that is what is presented in Doubts.He also fails to effectively defend his primary thesis, that ID is a scientific movement rather than a theistic movement. Woodward goes out of his way to point out ways in which ID uses empirical evidence for their anti-evolutionary stance. Nevertheless, he fails to point out the dichotomy induced by such things as the wedge theory. The wedge theory is where Stephen Johnson (one of the founders of ID) states out-right that the long-term goal of ID is to get theistic principles taught in schools and universities. Again and again, through Woodward's own representation of the facts it feels that the ID movement is simply trying to conceal a strong theistic motive under the shroud of empirical validity. I agree with the judge of the Dover case, when he ruled that ID is simply a thin-veiled attempt at bringing God back into science.Once again, I should note that I believe in Intelligent Design in a theistic sense. I believe that God created the universe and that God's hand is in the evolution and continued existence of this world. Nevertheless, I believe that science has no business dabbling in non-naturalistic explanations to natural phenomenon. Such explorations provide us with nothing.Therefore, I do not recommend this book. If you want to get the ID view, read a book by the founders of ID. Read one of the books that are unabashedly biased, rather than a book that tries to hide its bias. I have no problem with a book being biased. Any book trying to put forth a particular argument is going to be, by necessity, heavily laden with bias. Rather than read this book, read Darwin on Trial or Of Pandas and People. Doubts does little more than explain the contents of those books."},{"Title":"Doubts About Darwin: A History of Intelligent Design","review":"Are intelligent design proponents disinterested pursuers of the truth, honestly persuaded that the mainstream theory of evolution has serious problems? Or are they closet theocrats, trying to sneak a religious theory into the schools by covering it with a scientific veneer? Barbara Forrest and Paul Gross argue for the latter in Creationism's Trojan Horse, while Woodward presents the former view.Woodward is very interested in the rhetoric of science and how this affects its pursuits. However we may see science as going after truth, in practice it is done by human beings in a social setting, and persuading one's fellow scientists can involve more than showing them the evidence.And Woodward is not above using rhetoric for his own ends, with his word choices frequently betraying his pro-ID bias. Teaching Darwinian evolution in schools is always \\"dogmatic,\\" intelligent design is treated as \\"heresy\\", and critics of ID \\"scoff\\" at it. On the other side, the criticism of evolution by ID proponents is frequently \\"withering\\". However, Forrest and Gross are similarly biased in the other direction, so we'll let this go.Woodward presents the genesis and growth of a movement, starting with Michael Denton's Evolution: A Theory in Crisis, which inspires Philip Johnson and Michael Behe into skepticism about evolution. Then Johnson writes Darwin on Trial, which brings in people like Dembski, Meyer, and others. And of course Behe writes his own book, Darwin's Black Box, which brought in the key ID concept of irreducible complexity, to go with ID's only other key concept so far, Dembski's design inference. The second-hand coverage is less than satisfying, and I think my time might well have been better spent reading primary sources, like Denton or Johnson, rather than this retelling.Of the two books, Woodward presents the better-written and better-organized story. That doesn't mean that it's true, though. What becomes interesting is what he leaves out. There's no mention of the Discovery Institute's \\"Wedge Document,\\" which clearly states that the goal of undermining evolution is to restore Christianity as an influential force in society and government. And Woodward vehemently denies that creationism and ID have anything in common, when it's now known that the very first ID book, Of Pandas and People, did a sloppy cut-and-paste to remove every mention of creationism and replace it with intelligent design - at exactly the same time that the Supreme Court decided that creationism could not be taught in schools. He also refers to the Kansas state standards of 1999 simply as \\"deemphasizing the teaching of macroevolution\\" without bothering to mention that they were co-authored by the president of the Creation Science Association, who believes in the six-day-creation story of the Bible.What is important in the end, though, is not motivations but the truth. Mainstream evolutionary biologists must address any legitimate scientific issues that ID proponents bring forth, which they have done. (So far, at least in the mainstream view, none have held up to close scrutiny. Irreducible complexity was dealt satisfactorily with by mainstream biologists over 80 years ago, and the design inference is too context-dependent to be meaningful.) Meanwhile, it would be nice if the IDers would stick to the world of science until their hypotheses have greater support. As Eugenie Scott of the pro-evolution NCSE notes, the proper process for a theory to make its way into the schools is for the proponents of the theory to publish scientific works and argue them out with fellow scientists, not, as ID has done, make their very first publication (Of Pandas and People, as mentioned above) a high school textbook. That leads to a not unreasonable suspicion that the goals of the ID movement are not primarily scientific.Woodward sees a growing ID movement (more rhetoric: he refers to an \\"explosion\\" of interest in ID, by which he means that those interested grew from a handful of scientists to a couple dozen). That remains to be seen. As even the \\"Wedge Document\\" notes, the bedrock of ID must be scientific publications, and that is where ID has been seriously lacking so far, with only a handful of scientific papers to its name so far, and that's with a generous reckoning. Meanwhile, in the political arena, ID has seen numerous setbacks, from Judge Jones's decision in the Kitzmiller v. Dover case that ID is not science (hailed by evolution supporters and derided by ID supporters, of course) to the loss of supporters in the Kansas state school board that led to the evolution-friendly standards recently being adopted. Meanwhile, the ID movement has retreated from wanting to be taught in schools (as indicated by the Pandas textbook) to wanting to \\"teach the controversy\\" to wanting to \\"discuss the problems.\\"Whatever one's opinion, though, it's clear that the controversy isn't going away any time soon. It remains to be seen, though, just what form the controversy will take. However, to best follow the controversy, read the relevant works themselves rather than books like these, which stand aside and observe the controversy."},{"Title":"Doubts About Darwin: A History of Intelligent Design","review":"Having closely followed Intelligent Design for the past eleven years, I expect any new books in this genre to simply add to my ID knowledge base. THATS NOT WHAT THIS BOOK IS ABOUT!The &quot;big picture&quot; is critical to an in-depth understanding of any complex endeavor. Since I am by nature a detail person, I must work extra hard to &quot;see&quot; it. However, even hard work won't help you if you lack the analytical tools needed to &quot;step back&quot;. This book has provided me a framework with which to understand the ID movement. I'm actually going to re-read some of the key works that were highlighted with the new vantage point that I have.&quot;Doubts about Darwin&quot; practically turned its own pages! I could not set it down. Not only is the author good at rhetorical analysis, he is an excellent rhetor. (I didn't know the word 'rhetor' before I read Doubts). I especially enjoyed the book within a book. I felt that I was learning on two levels. As he provided rhetorical analysis, he was explaining the process to us. And the footnotes were quite informative. I had to stop and read most of them as I was zipping along. That probably kept me from getting literary indigestion, I was reading so fast!This is a good read and I heartily recommend it."},{"Title":"Doubts About Darwin: A History of Intelligent Design","review":"I was fully prepared to be underwhelmed by this book, after seeing that it was primarily a re-work of the author's Ph.D. work. I've seen how such books tend to be informative but often not a very compelling read. I was happily surprised to find that Doubts about Darwin has that unique combination of intrigue and education that made it hard to put down.I see this as (at least) a 4-in-1 book: (1) A thorough history of the Intelligent Design movement, (2) a broad review of much of the key literature in the field - you'll figure out which authors or books you'll want to read next, (3) a light and interesting on-going lesson in rhetoric and how it plays a key role in this issue, (4) a good introductory education on the ID topic itself that gives enough understanding to appreciate the debate.The description of the initial encounter between Phillip Johnson and SJ Gould may be worth the price of the book, and is a microcosm of the larger ID debate. Woodward gives unique, up-close views like that as he tracks the goings-on over the years.If I had to make a criticism, I'd say that Woodward spent quite a bit of time on Johnson's Darwin on Trial book. I could have been satisfied with a bit quicker pace in that section, but he obviously felt it was a cornerstone work in this engagement and worth a closer look, which I can understand. Generally he strikes a good balance, with 40 pages of small print notes in the back to keep the main story flowing. (But I found myself frequently drawn to the notes for more details anyway.)If you have any interest in getting a handle on this debate, or just like seeing what happens when the ideas of one group of smart people collides with the ideas of another, I don't expect you'll be at all disappointed with the Doubts book."},{"Title":"Doubts About Darwin: A History of Intelligent Design","review":"I have in my library a copy of William Paley's \\"Natural Theology\\" published in 1837 (one of many editions.) Paley was the originator of the \\"watchmaker\\" analogy, which was a basis of the argument from design for the existence of a creator. If you find a watch on the ground you do not believe that it arose by chance; its complexity proves the existence of a watchmaker. Similarly the universe, in its complexity, beauty, and perfection, could only have been designed by a conscious and creative will-a Creator. To Paley this of course meant God.\\"Natural Theology\\" and a similar book on the evidences for Christianity (also written by Paley) were very popular in their day. They were used as texts in many universities including Cambridge where Charles Darwin was a divinity student. He read them with much interest and was impressed by their tight arguments. Until his voyage on the H.M.S. Beagle he was in fact a follower of Paley. But his observations on the voyage, and the conclusions he found he had to draw from them, destroyed his faith in the argument from design, and after the publication of the Origin of Species, Paley's ideas fell in to disrepute.When Darwin found that the evidence forced him to reject Paley's arguments, he was acting as a scientist. Scientific ethics, indeed the whole idea behind science, demands that you follow the evidence rather than your personal beliefs and preferences.The subjects of the book under review, proponents of Intelligent Design (ID), take a different view. It is less important, they think, to follow the evidence, than to make sure that people believe the right things. If the evidence does not fit their preferences, they discount the evidence. Their chosen weapon in this war (for they see it as a war,) is rhetoric-the art of persuasion by any means possible. It is the method of the lawyer or politician, not the seeker of truth that all scientists (despite their very human flaws) are supposed to be. It is a struggle, not for truth, but for power.I find myself here, as a scientist, in an interesting position. I cannot and do not wish to refute the whole idea of a creator. For all I know there might have been one (I was not there when the universe was formed, but then neither were the ID people.) In truth the belief in a creator does not have the rigor of a scientific theory, as it cannot be really tested at all (despite what the ID people say, evolution can be tested - at least indirectly.) The existence of God or any other primordial creator simply cannot be proven or disproven. How would you test for existence of God? What experiments could you devise for that purpose? A concept that cannot be proven or disproven belongs not in the realm of science, but of faith, despite the current attempt to make it sound scientific.This brings me to an irritating point. ID people often claim that they are not arguing for the existence of the Christian God, but only of a creator. This is to me a disingenuous statement. Who is this creator that they have postulated but God? If not God, are they arguing for an extraterrestrial intelligence? I am inclined to conclude that in essence they are trying to interject theism into science, despite claims to the contrary. It is true that not all scientists are fair in their treatment of religious belief - they would inject atheism into science, which should remain as free as possible from any preconceived notions. However, I tend agree with Gould that science and the humanities (including religion) are essentially separate magisteria and as such can sometimes interact, but one can never supercede the other. If that happened, in my view both would be corrupted.This book is a reasonably good history of the ID movement, told from the view of someone who is convinced that they are on the right track. It should be read with this in mind. However, advocacy is never a substitute for critical thinking. Evolutionary theory has flaws and there is a ways to go before we understand either the universe or life on earth (if indeed we ever do!) but the principle that scientific debates should involve hard data must stand.To get a more accurate and critical view of this debate I recommend the works of Robert Pennock."},{"Title":"Doubts About Darwin: A History of Intelligent Design","review":"From my goodreads.com review:Thomas Woodward wrote a most excellent bookabout the history of the ID movement and to acertain extent the Darwinian movement as well.The book looks not only at the history of IDand Darwinism but also the rhetoric of bothsides as well.Woodward is very fair to both sides even though hehimself is a Christian design advocate.Lot's of info and scientific facts aboundin this book and at times it can get a bittechnical and boring as well as over intellectual.I do like however how Woodward uses clever waranalogies such as comparing the battle betweenID and Darwinian evolution advocates and theirdebates to battles in World War II such as TheNormandy Invasion.Woodward talks a lot about Philip E.

It's clear Woodward is enamoured of the men of whom he is writing, and has written this book with the intent of being the first to write a history of a movement he is convinced will have great influence in the future.

The author approaches the movement from a rhetorical perspective - discussing how ID advocates have communicated their views. Though it is clear that Woodward is sympathetic to the anti-Darwin camp, his primary focus is on ID as an intellectual and rhetorical phenomenon.Woodward examines the rhetoric techniques used by leading figures in the ID movement, primarily; Denton, Johnson and Behe. I particularly enjoyed the discussion of Philip Johnson. Whether one agrees with Johnson or not, the courage and energy required to spearhead a revolutionary movement such as ID is admirable. Readers who have followed this debate may find Woodward's comments about Johnson's interactions with leading evolutionary commentators (such as Raup Ruse and Gould) worthwhile - I found his treatment of the various personalities to be relatively even-handed.One of the book's more interesting aspects is its examination of evolutionary theory in light Thomas Kuhn's work on scientific paradigms. I agree with the author that the ID movement has highlighted many of the difficulties associated with Darwinism (e.g. limited empirical evidence for macro evolution, the complexity of sub-cellular organisms, the recognition of the role played by philosophical assumptions). Despite its weakened explanatory power, however, I think a paradigm shift away from Darwinism will require a more robust alternative than is currently offered by ID. It is one thing to identify weaknesses in a current theory, it is another to offer an alternative that can capture the imagination. Theoretical vacuums are problematic and unless a compelling alternative is brought forward Darwinism (warts and all) will likely remain in place - albeit in a weakened state.Woodward's acknowledgement of the understanding that has developed between academics in the two camps since Denton's initial public challenge to Darwinism in the 1980s is helpful. It is important that scientific theories remain open to question. Sometime these challenges will carry the day - sometimes they won't. When challenges to the status quo come forward they need to be examined and engaged - the truth will prevail. In the long run, fear mongering and personal attacks are counterproductive and unconvincing instruments of persuasion.Overall it is an excellent book. I highly recommend it to anyone following the ongoing debate on evolutionary theory. A good starting point for someone new to the issue may be Johnson's Darwin on Trail (a bit dated but helpful) and Miller's Finding Darwin's God (the latter part discussing religion is weak, but, his defence of evolution is well handled)."},{"Title":"Doubts About Darwin: A History of Intelligent Design","review":"The evolution debate becomes more heated when you mention creationism. This book does an excellent job taking the creationism element out and asking the reader to seriously consider alternatives to the origins of the universe and creation. ID does look at a force outside of our realm as the catalyst for creation of the universe and the many species on our planet. It doesn't spout its premise based on \\"faith\\" but rather on scientific data and the complexities with life. It does not dispute any science but it looks at it in a different light. It also does not dispute micro-evolution and the Big Bang, which I believe gives it a bit more credibility as it is truly looking at all the scientific data. The author provides a great deal of additional literature the reader may want to investigate. Not only has it sparked my interest in the ID movement, but in evolution in general. I look forward to reading the arguements from both sides now that I have the leading names in the field. The book is not about religion but are we really looking at the scientific field objectively."},{"Title":"Doubts About Darwin: A History of Intelligent Design","review":"The main reason I enjoyed this book was because of the approach. As I continue to read books about Intelligent Design and Evolution, I am most impressed with those that examine the unexamined. The fact that the theory of Evolution has a history, logic, rhetoric, and worlview is so important to remember. Unless Evolution is revelation it should not be beyond question, doubts, and refutation where it is proven false. This book shows how both ID and Evolution believers speak about their theories. It is a solid reflection on an unconsidered issue. Now I await the book that examines the logic (or lack thereof) in the ID and Evolution movements."},{"Title":"Doubts About Darwin: A History of Intelligent Design","review":"In Thomas Woodard's excellent new book, \\"Doubts about Darwin,\\" he recounts the history of the modern intelligent design (ID) movement. He focuses on pivotal people such as Michael Denton, Phillip Johnson, Michael Behe and William Dembski and some of their ground-breaking books such as Denton's \\"Evolution: A theory in Crisis\\" and Johnson's \\"Darwin on Trial.\\"The book focuses mainly on these individuals' methodology and development of arguments, the establishing of the movement and the reactions of evolutionists. The actual science of either theory is only cursorily reviewed.From the beginning, ID has tried to distance itself from other forms of creationism in order to avoid the historic \\"science vs. religion\\" stigma. In particular it has tried to stay away from young-earthism (also known as scientific creationism or creation science). Even though many if not most of the ID theorists accept the validity of an ancient Earth (\\"...the fact [is] that the vast majority of design advocates are open to a universe that is billions of years old. [27]\\" ), they still haven't addressed the young-earth theory head on. Under a \\"big tent\\" policy, they let all design theorists in. But this is introducing the difficulties they were trying to avoid.Consider the following statements about ID and from ID supporters:\\"Another mark [of ID] is the avoidance of ...any details that come from a literal reading of Genesis. [27]\\"\\"The modern phenomenon known as \`scientific creationism' did not even exist in 1959. It was not until 1962 that theologian John Whitcomb and hydraulic engineer Henry Morris gave birth to that movement when they published their \\"Genesis Flood.\\" [35]\\"\\"...regarding the age of the earth...I have no desire to quarrel with the generally accepted estimate of four or five billion years...nor do I assume that the literalists are reading the Bible correctly... [81]\\"\\"I assume that creation-scientists are biased by their precommitment to Biblical fundamentalism...I want to investigate whether Darwinism is based upon a fair assessment of the scientific evidence, or whether or not it is another kind of fundamentalism. [93]\\"With such statements which are apparently very strongly against young-earthism, why are skeptics still successful at painting ID as \\"disguised creationism\\" or keeping discussions of ID out of schools?One, notice that ID often refers to young-earthers and their \\"literal\\" interpretation of the Bible. The problem here is that their interpretation is not literal. If it were literal, then resulting contradictions and problems would render the Bible wrong. Skeptics see this and are essentially saying, \\"These ID people believe in God, yet Genesis is wrong, so ID must be fundamentally wrong as well.\\"So no matter how much ID supporters say ID only generically points to a designer, skeptics will see what they believe is faulty Christianity (i.e. young-earthism) as a basis as ID (since most ID theorists are Christians). So as long as ID says \\"young-earth is wrong\\" and does not detail why it is wrong and not literal Biblical interpretation, they will be unable to obtain the level of scholarly acceptance they are seeking.This young-earth problem enhances the ID fallacy that science, \\"...is ill-equipped to identify God as the creator. [27]\\" ID spends so much time promoting solid scientific method and showing naturalism is not scientific at all, yet they themselves stop short. They are deciding a priori that science cannot give specifics about who or what this designer is, only that there is a designer. This is a result of trying to avoid being labeled as creationists or as trying to teach religion in schools. But they artificially telling science what it may conclude, just as the young-earthers and naturalists are doing. If science leads to God of the Bible, then it does so.One way to show that ID's designer is God of the Bible, one must show that the Bible and science agree and that the literal translation supports what real science as found. The fact is that Genesis and science do agree. In fact, people like Hugh Ross have detailed this in books such as \\"The Genesis Question\\" with the same quality of scholarship as other ID books - in effect he has solved the problems of ID discussed here, but they have thus far refused to use the solution. (I also noticed that no reference of Hugh Ross is made in Woodard's book, even though he has been cataloging design evidences for years - consider that Denton and Dembski refer/defer to him on these subjects in some of their books - and he was a featured scholar in the book \\"Mere Creation\\" which Woodard writes about, not mentioning Ross and some other participants.)ID has grown much in recent years, yet many still know little about it. Many oppose it because they see it - however wrongly - related to flawed young-earthism. Removing this creationist stigma fully and totally will allow ID to prosper and supplant flawed Darwinism as the primary and most reasonable theory on origins."},{"Title":"Doubts About Darwin: A History of Intelligent Design","review":"Professor Thomas Woodward, Ph.D. teaches systematic theology, communications, and the history of science at Trinity College, Florida. Woodward's 2001 doctoral dissertation concerned the history of the Intelligent Design (hereafter, ID) movement, and in 2003 Baker Books (Grand Rapids, Michigan) published a reader-friendly revision of it entitled Doubts About Darwin (hereafter, Doubts). Subtitled A History of Intelligent Design, the book is, as a reviewer for Christianity Today observed, focused less on recording an unabridged history of ID \\"and more on the rhetoric of the movement.\\"Professor Woodward's several academic specialties and his long-term personal relationships with a number of key figures in the ID movement make him uniquely qualified to serve as a chronicler of the phenomenon. Indeed, Dr. Woodward's Doubts offers the same kind of eyewitness account of the birth and development of the modern ID movement as Dr. Luke's Acts did of nascent Christianity. However, Woodward's insider's perspective is not entirely without its drawbacks; at times Doubts' tone reads less like a dispassionate report and more like an advocate's polemic, calling into question the author's objectivity. Regrettably, that is not the book's most important deficit. Conspicuously absent from Doubts is the all-important role sin--i.e., humanity's willful rebellion against the lordship of the Intelligent Designer--has played and will continue to play in preventing mainstream biology from returning to a biblical paradigm of nature.Regrettably, Doubts leaves the reader with the false impression that the ID movement is currently a tropical depression destined to become a category five hurricane, an unstoppable ideological force with the potential to level any and all competing theories in its path. Woodward seems certain that eventually, ID theory must prevail, since Neo-Darwinism has a fatal \\"reality\\" problem (200). His optimism, though admirable, is mysterious given the numerous troubling anecdotes and outcomes that have attended the modern ID movement since its infancy. Woodward himself observes thatThe debaters are contending over the fundamental cultural story of humankind, and those who succeed at crafting and telling the most convincing story of origins hold in their hands supreme cultural authority. If any group, religious or scientific, gains the authority to present its own story as uniquely true and to label other stories as mythological, this group functions as the high priesthood of our time. (31)If God-fearing priests persecuted Amos, the Apostle Paul, Martin Luther, and countless others, it seems extremely unlikely that the God-forsaking priests of secularism will ever willingly surrender their cultural authority. The idea that science is an insular, self-correcting discipline concerned only with the facts is also beset by a major \\"reality problem,\\" namely the reality of sin.The Bible makes plain empirical evidence for an Intelligent Designer has always been visible (Ps. 19:1-2; Rom. 1:20), but seeing that evidence requires eyes that are willing to see (cf. Jn. 12:37). Humans have resisted the lordship of the Intelligent Designer since the Fall in the Garden, which is why there will be no natural explanation too intellectually gymnastic for naturalists determined to retain the illusion that they are the lords of the earth.

It's an incredible intellectual undertaking and I can't praise it enough.For anyone who has been following the creation/evolution debate for any length of time, the book is a treasure. It may best be described as an \\"exegesis\\" of the supporting volumes of the Intelligent Design movement. Its major contributions to the debate are its philosophical analysis of the rhetoric supporting the evolutionary paradigm, the exposure of its \\"a priori\\" nature, and the exposure of the scientific establishment's metaphysical commitment to naturalism. The evolutionary paradigm is shifting, and this book will be a major contributor to the shift.Many of the book's conclusions have, of course, been suggested before throughout the history of this movement, but never have they been stated and summarized in such an intellectually stimulating, compelling, and thorough way. This is truly a monumental book."},{"Title":"Doubts About Darwin: A History of Intelligent Design","review":"This book is simply Dr. Woodward's PhD dissertation on the history of the intelligent design movement. The book provides background on the movement's leaders including Dr. Michael Behe, Dr. William Dembski, and Mr. Philip Johnson, all of whom have all authored books debating the merits of Darwinian evolution."},{"Title":"Doubts About Darwin: A History of Intelligent Design","review":"The recent Intelligent Design movement and its controversies are producing their own history--and historians. This work gives an insider's take on this the latest episodic series of the great debate, with extended vignettes beginning with Denton's watershed Evolution: A Theory in Crisis.What makes the book the more interesting is the perspective on Thomas Kuhn's study of paradigms brought, most appropriately, into the discussion. This was prefigured in Denton's asides in his Evolution: A Theory in Crisis where he throws up his hands and starts quoting Feyerbend, concluding with a swipe at the 'priority of the paradigm'. Whatever one thinks of the religious issues brought into the question of evolution (and the design issue is detached from that, at least on the surface, by the Intelligent Design group), we have a case of those outside the system of belief portrayed as trying to break down the hypnotic hold of the scientific ideology. It is a sad commentary on science.Related to these Kuhnian issues is an extended discussion of the 'rhetoric of science' and its relationship to the discourses of both scientists and their critics. This added twist gives the book an extra depth.Whatever one's views, the book is well worth reading. The Intelligent Design folk seem to be wishfully thinking they can induce a paradigm shift. Maybe.But I fear it that more than Kuhnian paradigm mechanics is involved in the Medusa'd 'stone cold and out it' blank of the Top Dollar Science Regiment on Darwin. Paradigms are earnest beliefs deludedly held. One may see the light and snap out of it. But people who brazenly deceive don't undergo paradigm shifts. They tote up their media control, and otherwise don't 'give a darn'. (Most scientists don't fall in that category). The Darwin situation is much broader than the state of a theory stuck in 'normal science'. It is Top Dog propaganda for a whole style of civilization, with the Captains of Industry at risk. Hey, wall street could collapse if Darwin were found wrong. It has not so much to do with Science?! No way we will get a paradigm change. Fibs are not paradigms.Very interesting work, however one feels about the current design discourse."},{"Title":"My chess career,","review":"This book presents several of Capablanca's games before he became a world champion. I really enjoyed (and still enjoy) studying and playing over these games. Capablanca was perhaps one of the top 3 world champs (with Fischer and Kasparov). His games show much clarity and are easy to understand even though the moves would be hard to find on one's own.Capablanca has brief notes with a little analysis. I wish he would have had a little more. However, I enjoyed his notes, because in spots it elucidated a key point to a plan he had. However, these notes are few, perhaps one or two per game. Often, he makes a statement like &quot;Better would have been X&quot; without explaining. These comments are not very useful for amateur players. However, he sometimes (perhaps once a game) gives a more useful comment, such as the reasoning behind the move, or the reply to another dangerous looking move to the opponent.The games themselves are beautiful. It is interesting seeing how Capablanca's game evolved from when he was a child. One great feature of the book is that before each &quot;period&quot; he talks about how he has changed. For example, he mentions that he did not know much about openings, but that he was very strong in the endgame since a youth. Later, he talks about how he matures and becomes a more complete player.In summary:Positive:1. Incredible games by Capa. One can't help but feel &quot;stronger&quot; as a player after studying these games.2. Interesting commentary on his development.3. Analysis (when he gives it) is very insightful.Negatives:1. Not enough explaination behind the analysis.2. Descriptive notation is not as common (a later version in algebraic is available, and I would give that 4 stars)."},{"Title":"My chess career,","review":"A great book that gives us the chance to known a little more about the events of the life of one of the greatest chess players of all time.

Among Capablanca opponents in these games one finds Alekhine, Niemzowitch, Janowski, Yates, Marshall, and Berstein among many others.Each game is fully commented and annotated by Capablanca himself, and you can find suggestion that can help improve any reader's game in almost every paragraph.Capablanca includes at the end of the book a short concluding essay on the basic precepts of opening, middle-game and end-game strategy."},{"Title":"My chess career,","review":"Out of the 20+ chess titles in my library, My Chess Career, by Capablanca, remains my favorite.The first hand explanations from the eventual world champion are useful, but sometimes abrupt.

In the wonderfully descriptive and magnificently apt work, 'my chess career' the Cuban chess whiz Capablanca is able to do just that. One can feel the complex mind processes going on inside a genius's realm of thought as Capablanca annotates numerous games. Although my praises for his ability to make the reader feel that he's almost part of the experience are plentiful, I believe the writing is at times slightly too 'wordy' and although it's not a button I would like to push, I just have to say sometimes I felt that a point came when the word 'exaggeration' became relevant.By the end of the read if anything the reader finds himself with a newfound respect for the genius involved in a game like chess and those who play it.

All in all, 35 games are annotated by Capablanca in person with remarkable objectivity - bestowing praise and hurling criticism as and when required. Capablanca was a natural chess genius in the mould of Morphy, Kasparov and Fischer. He has been described as the Mozart of chess to Alekhine's Beethoven.Capa - as he was known - was born in Cuba in 1888, and by 1921 he was world champion, having disposed of Lasker in a match where the defending champion could not win a single game. Capa was virtually indestructible and it was only towards the end of his career in the late 1930's that the younger generation could begin to score consistent victories against him. Meanwhile his reputation for invincibility remains in the annals of chess."},{"Title":"Othello","review":"'King Lear' is probably one of my favourite Shakespeare plays and is currently the one most studied at A-Levels. It is famed for it's depiction of the infirmity of old age and complex family politics. In some respects I think it'd be rather presumptuous of me to attempt to review Shakespeare. Someone so well known and influential wouldn't benefit from my opinions on their work, plus there are more scholarly and concise reviews out there. But I can comment on these Arden versions. Of all the Shakespeare I've read I've always found the Arden copies to be well laid out and to have excellent commentary and notes on the text. They really add to your understanding of Shakespeares outstanding plays and introduce you to the depth in his work. They have superb paper quality and are bound well, withstanding repeated readings and intensive study. For your collection of Shakespeare you can't do much better than Arden publications, some are quite hard to get hold of but it's worth the effort.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."},{"Title":"Othello","review":"This play embodies tragedy, and may be my favorite play by Shakes. Othello has wonderful elements - some of the most unbearable and longest dramatic irony of any play, a devilish villain whose true motives we are left to guess, a virtuous but flawed protagonist, the triumph of evil over good. Othello is a gut-wrenching play and should be appreciated for its sheer dramatic energy and passion. Certainly other questions are explored - such as the issue of racial insecurities even in a successful and admired man among prejudiced people. However, perhaps the most important things to take out of it is the sheer evil that Iago spreads around him, puppeteering the good characters with strings of wickedness."},{"Title":"Othello","review":"This play leaves the reader with a feeling of despair. How could there be such evil in the world as is in Iago's heart? How could there be such jealousy as with Roderigo? And what of Desdemona's undying love...so powerful that with her last breath she denies that it was indeed her husband that took her life. The flood of emotion and pain in this book leave the reader feeling a great desperation for humanity. However, the reader will find humor in the irony and figurative language that is woven throughout the dialogue. This play exposes the darkest side of man with several thrilling murders and continuous deception. It also colors the most desirable characteristics of man...devotion, trust, and love. Read this play!"},{"Title":"Othello","review":"Othello is now one of my favorite Shakesperean plays, right behind Romeo and Juliet.

I have to not-so-respectfully disagree with the previous reviewer; this recording is layered, clear, and absolutely pulsating with passion and tension.It's worth every penny, and I say that as a fan of audiobooks in general and Shakespeare in particular.

I found this hard to listen to and understand, sorry!"},{"Title":"Othello","review":"\\"Othello\\" is sort of a companion piece to \\"Macbeth\\" -- both are about noble, upstanding men who are destroyed by their own weaknesses. But where Macbeth was ruined by ambition, Othello's destruction comes from his jealousy and gullibility. And the play is really ruled by the nastiest, cruelest, most devious villain Shakespeare ever wrote.That villain is Iago, a high-ranking soldier who has a grudge against the noble Moorish soldier Othello, who has just eloped with the beautiful Desdemona. Using a nobleman as his pawn, Iago first turns Desdemona's father against Othello, but the new soldier defends himself agains claims of witchcraft.But Iago's true plan is far more devious, as he disgraces Othello's lieutenant Cassion and plants Desdemona's handkerchief in Cassio's room. Othello finds himself confronted by a chess game of lies, deceit and suspected infidelity, and his jealousy reaches a fever pitch that can only end in death.Yeah, the real star of this play is undoubtedly Iago. This is the most repellent mixture of absolute malicious evil and crazy-smart intellect that anyone could write -- he is the person you love to hate, even as you admire how devilishly perfect he is at playing the chessmaster who whispers poison into your ear while playing your \\"friend.\\" He doesn't quite think of EVERYTHING, but he comes close enough that you would NEVER want to deal with someone like this.But this tragedy is also underscored by the depiction of Othello, a truly noble and loyal soldier who is turned into a deranged homicidal mess. It's somehow even more disturbing to see him deteriorate than it was to see Macbeth, because this guy was on top of the world in every way -- he was smart, eloquent, a brilliant soldier and a newlywed. And look what happens to him.And Shakespeare deftly builds up this tragedy with a subtle, interconnecting web of lies and misdirections, with the tension building slowly until something has to blow. His writing is typically powerful, generating some quotable phrases (\\"It is the green-ey'd monster\\") and lots of cynical, dark dialogue (\\"Who would not make her husband a cuckold to make him a monarch?\\").\\"Othello\\" is a strangely fascinating tragedy, with Shakespeare absorbing us again in the tale of a good man corrupted. Definitely a good, if harrowing play."},{"Title":"Othello","review":"This review is not of Othello itself (which is tremendously good), but rather on this edition of Othello (ISBN: 9781411400399), which was edited by Daniel Vitkus and David Scott Kastan.I read a lot of heavily annotated books, and I have to say that the Barnes & Noble Shakespeare editions have one of the best book designs I've ever encountered. The various references materials (footnotes and definitions for archaic words) appear in a manner that makes the text very easy to follow.The scholarship is also top-notch. The annotations give you enough to make things clear without insulting your intelligence, or without overburdening you with unnecessary detail. The essays are also interesting and informative.I've been avoiding Shakespeare ever since high school, which was many years ago. Now that I'm reading him again, I'm glad I'm in such good hands.

The plot has many moments of uniqueness and suspense. Kindle edition is my favorite."},{"Title":"Othello","review":"Perhaps one of the best of Shakespeare's plays, King Lear is worth a good read. I was introduced to the ARDEN series by a class that required us all to be on the same page as it were, so I was at first weary to use them. Like all editions put out (Penguin, Folger, Barnes and Noble, Arden, etc) They all have valuable notes and references, introductions and essays on various subjects on the content, form and history of the play you are about to read. So half this book is taken up by the introdcution and history. Every Arden starts with the same couple of chapters on Shakpespeare. The editor, R.A. Foakes has a very in depth and interseting introduction to the text of LEAR which is worth a read, but of course, in my opinion, after you have read the play and tried to understand it for yourself.I personally prefer the way the Folger series of shakespeare is set up with text on one page and the notes for it are directly opposite the page you are reading, making note referencing while you read easy. Arden tends to give you notes on variations between the quarto and folio which is good, but when I'm reading a play I could care less about textual variations or how editors have fussed with changing one word to make sense of a thought. However interesting it sometimes is, I don't like looking down to read a note on a passage and its all about the textual variation, but will not explain the thought further.Final thought: Great Resource for reading LEAR, not the best for READING LEAR, especially for the first time."},{"Title":"Othello","review":"This is a conflated edition of King Lear, with Foakes combining the two original sources. When the chips are down -- that is, when one cannot have both versions -- he tends to opt for the later (Folio) one. This is especially so in the last scene where this choice produces a somewhat less bleak ending.On each page of the play's text about half the space is taken up with notes. These can, by and large, be ignored if you want to enjoy the play, but can be highly useful if something puzzles you. They cover a variety of matters, such as the meaning of now obscure word, interpretation when it is not clear what word is actually meant, choices where the two originals have difference words, often explaining the choice, possible stage direction or ways of staging the play and so on. They are usually well done, though possibly excessive.A long essay introducing the play explains the editor's approach, comments on some critical issues, and comments on various stagings of the play. These are informative and often stimulating, with Foakes not being stridently attached to any one interpretation. There is available elsewhere an incredibly large amount of comment on all aspects of King Lear and how to interpret it, most of which Foakes wisely ignores. The play is the thing, and one of the advantages of reading it (as opposed to atending a production) is that one can contemplate the different interpretations and emphases that are possible. To a large extent Foakes sets this up, and then lets the reader proceed, rather than forcing a particular version, as happens (often very badly when directors want to demonstrate their originality) inevitably with a staged -- or filmed or audio -- production."},{"Title":"Othello","review":"This is a thoroughly edited and explained version of Othello. The introduction and other additional writings are well-researched and well-written, and provide valuable background on the play and the way it has been performed and interpreted over the years.

Forget reading it aloud! They have no idea what they are saying, and it is painful for all of us. And having them read it on their own is a joke, as they will stop after a page because they can't understand what they are reading.This unabridged, dramatized reading of Othello is a perfect solution for anyone who wants to read and understand Shakespeare in his original vernacular without reading some kind of \\"updated\\" version. The characters are distinct, the pace exciting, and the included music really sets the scene. You could just listen to the CD, but if you're not familiar with the story or you have trouble with Shakespeare, I would follow along with a text as well. And of course, listen to it more than once because you will pick up new ideas or images each time--I know I do!I have purchased this product twice (once on tape and once on CD). I would love to have a whole Shakespeare set of these!"},{"Title":"Othello","review":"The Arden edition of King Lear (I believe this one is in its third printing) is a combination of both the Quarto and the Folio editions of the play. Of course, when you end up with a conflated edition (one that is made up of both) you are left at the mercy of the editor but, for my money, R.A. Foakes does an excellent job of integrating the manuscripts and often points out in the notes which and why certain choices were made.Other people have summarized the plot of King Lear here at amazon.com so I won't engage in that sort of review. I will concentrate instead on the particular edition and why I think it's among the best and then I will point out some things to look for in the play, things that I believe deserve close attention, things that will add to your enjoyment of the play.First of all the Arden edition - the book is basically divided into two major parts: the essays and the play. The play occupies the top half of each page, while the editorial notes and \\"translations\\" are found on the bottom. So, for example, when King Lear first lets us know about \\"divesting\\" his kingdom, Foakes tells us that this word is important because it sets an important pattern regarding clothes throughout the play.Sometimes the observations are incisive and surprisingly good, sometimes not as good. For example, when Lear starts talking about \\"By all the operation of the orbs / From whom we do exist, and cease to be\\", Foakes points out that the orbs are the planets (during Shakespeare's lifetime, the alignments of the planets was important - the word \\"disaster\\" actually means stars out of alignment - the kind of worldview that held the earth as the center of the universe was the worldview that Shakespeare inherited and lived in). But Foakes fails to mention that the orbs are also our EYES and in their full operation, opening your eyes can make one \\"exist\\" (as in we see them) and closing your eyes can make one \\"cease to be\\" (as in you don't see them). Furthermore, the orbs can be seen as being the eyes of God and us existing in them. Bishop Berkely's philosophy relied heavily on the idea that everything exists because God perceives it.Anyway, just realize that the greatest of notes are nowhere near as good as the greatest of care and attention when reading. Especially when reading the greatest writer that ever lived.Now onto some things I believe everyone should pay attention to. The word \\"love\\" appears in the play more than any other word of meaning (obviously I'm excluding words like \\"the\\" in the search). Now if you combine language that are related to eyes (sight, orbs, look, see, etc) you will also notice a great preponderance of these words. The same thing will happen if you combine the other senses (touch, feeling, smell, etc). Why is this of any import? Well, if you're going to write about something, you're going to have to use words. If something is important, you're going to want to drive that point home so you will be using some words more than others. This is an indication that the play you're reading is going to be about those things. So \\"love\\", \\"seeing\\", \\"nature\\", \\"clothes\\" and animals such as \\"dog, snake, wolf, etc\\" are words that appear a lot and are important.Sometime Shakespeare is so goddamn clever that you could spend a lifetime and not catch everything. For example, it wasn't until my 2nd reading of the play that I noticed he tells Kent\\"Our potency made good, take thy reward.Five days we do allot thee, for provisionTo shield thee from diseases of the world;And on the sixth to turn thy hated backUpon our kingdom: if, on the tenth day following,Thy banish'd trunk be found in our dominions,The moment is thy death. Away! by Jupiter,This shall not be revoked.\\"Notice the word \\"provision\\". The root of the word is pro-vision. It means to look ahead. Later on in the play Kent reappears, in disguise! Is Shakespeare having fun with us or am I reading too much into what could be an unintended use of the word? Let me put it this way - if I'm going to find morsels like this one, Shakespeare gets the credit.The words relating to seeing and feeling are especially important if you take tragedy to be an epistemological problem. If the tragic figure is one that denies a kind of knowledge (Lear and Gloucester certainly do this) then one can deny it by not seeing or feeling, hence the words that relate to the acquisition of knowledge through empirical means. Notice in the above verses that Kent will be told to re-appear, but he can only reappear in disguise. Lear has already denied his love and devotion. Kent must reappear as something else to allow Lear to \\"love him\\" again.Lastly, pay close attention to Shakespeare's doubling and mirroring. This is a favorite thing of his to do. I remember that the first time I read \\"Measure for Measure\\" I noticed doubling and mirroring on every page. Then I read it again and noticed these things every 5 lines. Then I read it again and started noticing them with ever increasing frequency! In King Lear the mirroring is much more subtle and even more rewarding. Notice how Goneril ends up \\"confusing\\" Gloucester with Lear when she tells him to \\"smell\\" his \\"way to Dover\\". From that moment on Gloucester and Lear become doubles and possibly even more and the reader becomes a party to the confusion.Reading Shakespeare is a mind blowing experience and King Lear is probably his greatest play (and that's saying something considering he also wrote \\"Hamlet\\", \\"Othello\\" and \\"Macbeth\\").Shakespeare wrote this play towards the end of his playwright's career. He had two daughters, one of which was a bit of an embarrassment to him. It's fun to hypothesize whether retiring was on his mind and if it was his own intent\\"To shake all cares and business from our age;Conferring them on younger strengths, while weUnburthen'd crawl toward death.\\"I cannot leave a review of King Lear without mentioning some important essays on it. A few years back philosopher Stanley Cavell wrote a review called \\"The Avoidance of Love\\". His reading of King Lear is revolutionary beyond belief. No student or lover of Shakespeare's plays should be without it. The essay has been combined with other Cavell essays on other Shakespearian plays and is available in the book \\"Disowning Knowledge\\". Amazon has it. It will blow your mind. Also, A.C. Bradley wrote a famous essay on King Lear that should be read as well.P.S. check out the cool and artistic cover which features a tree trunk splitting into three branches. Is it an allegory for the play? By golly, I think it is. That's Arden for you - quality cover to cover :)"},{"Title":"Othello","review":"Although RA Foakes' Arden3 edition appeared some years after those of Wells & Taylor (Complete Oxford) and Jay L Halio (Cambridge) it did not follow their precedent of issuing separate texts based on Quarto and Folio originals. These early texts (Q 1608 and F 1623 respectively) occasionally offer quite different versions of the play and reconciling them to form a single, coherent whole is a task that is, arguably, less elegant than the dual edition solution. By comparison, Arden's text looks cumbersome, with numerous Q and F superscripts surrounding passages found exclusively in one or other source.Foakes is well aware that his single, 'conflated' text isn't as fashionable as those of the 'revisionists' mentioned above, who believe that the Folio text of Lear represents Shakespeare's revised and final draft, and that modern editors should not pick and mix between Q and F but respect the integrity of the two early sources. While seemingly reactionary, Foakes is in fact countering the new orthodoxy of Halio et al. In his view, their 'dogmatic and purist stance ... abandons the idea of King Lear as a single work of which we have two versions.' He is cautious and level-headed in his approach, aware of the limitations of scholarly speculation and in presenting both Q and F variants he allows the reader to make up her/his own mind.Aside from this central controversy, Arden3 Lear has much to offer. Foakes reminds us of some key differences between the Jacobean world and our own: the original audience, he says, would have tuned in much more readily than us to puns and linguistic innovation; grasped the symbolic difference between crown and coronet; fully understood the distinctions of 'thou' and 'thee'; and recognised the constitutional impossibility of a monarch giving away his kingdom as though it were in his personal gift. The Introduction also presents illuminating discussions on loyalty and disobedience (in which Oswald could conceivably be seen as an ideal servant and Kent a bad one), on the problem of illusion in Gloucester's attempted suicide (IV.6) and on the influence of writers such as Harsnett, Erasmus and Montaine. Plentiful examples of dramatic practice from the play's long stage history are skilfully integrated into these discussions, while its equally rich critical history - especially that of the C20 - is helpfully evaluated. The conclusion is that there can be no return to Christian redemptionist optimism on the one hand or to totally nihilistic interpretations on the other. A recognition of the play's complexity, paradoxes and contradictions have led many to feel, in the words of Richard Fly, 'a deep distrust of all attempts at closure' in King Lear.Ultimately, therefore, this Arden3 is not as radical as rival editions. But it presents an honest, balanced and democratic version of the play in which judgements are occasionally forcefully expressed and occasionally left unresolved. It is comprehensive, authoritative and thought-provoking and should be of value to any serious student."},{"Title":"Othello","review":"The Arkangel audio CD's of Shakespeare's plays have an outstanding reputation. Most are really first rate and are quite enjoyable to listen to. Hamlet, MacBeth and Julius Caesar are very well done, complete plays well interpreted.

The overall productions and main players seem to have been chosen to project caricature rather than serious adaptation. That may be a fair point in a class room, but these two plays deserve a serious presentation."},{"Title":"Othello","review":"The rating of four stars is for the edition (R.A. Foakes's); the play is one of the greatest tragedies ever written, and of course deserves at least five stars.It is not easy to find a a truly satisfactory edition of this play. An advantage of R.A. Foakes's is that he offers us a &quot;conflated&quot; text, i.e. one that aims to reconstruct something like what Shakespeare originally wrote by taking elements from the best two early printings rather than giving us those separately or by settling for the one rather than the other. I don't think, though, that Foakes's reconstruction is nearly as convincing as that of earlier editors who presented conflated texts. I am often unhappy about his glosses, too, and about his rather &quot;trendy&quot; introduction. Even so, the introduction and the notes do give us most of what we need, so long as we approach this material with independence of mind.The PLAY is the thing, and whichever text we read it in (even, for example, in a text based just on that in the Folio), it is a great and moving work. Lear is an ageing king (about 80+), whose life has been sheltered and pampered. Although this equips him badly for &quot;real&quot; life, he is not intrinsically the evil tyrant that much current criticism tends to suggest - even his authoritarianism seems a matter of habit rather than anything else. At the beginning of the play he foolishly decides that he will give each of his three daughters a part of his kingdom. His intention had been to give the youngest daughter, Cordelia, with whom he planned to spend his &quot;retirement&quot;, the biggest portion. However, rather than simply proceeding with his plan, he asks his daughters to declare the degree of their love for him, and this is where tangible trouble starts.Goneril and Regan, both flatterers who seek their own interest at all times, butter him up, but Cordelia, who is honest, offends Lear's ego by refusing to follow her sisters' phoney example. He then offers the two eldest daughters 50% each, and disinherits Cordelia. Soon Goneril and Regan, contrary to what had been arranged, refuse to give him hospitality, and plan his death. Cordelia, though badly treated by him, tries to rescue her father, and the two are reconciled in a most moving scene, but she is killed and carried onto the stage in an immensely painful way by Lear, whose sanity had been temporarily destroyed by his daughters' and his own behaviour but who paradoxically gains new insight into life as a result of everything he experiences during the course of his suffering.His story is paralleled by that of the Earl of Gloucester, who similarly wrongly prefers a bad child to one who is good, yet is treated well by the good child, Edgar, who like Cordelia shows that love consists of forgiveness and generosity rather than anything else. Just as Lear learned wisdom through madness, Gloucester acquires it after he has been blinded by some of the most evil people in the play.It is in many ways a &quot;bleak&quot; play, not giving us any reason to hope that there is a God who looks after us in this life or one hereafter, and showing plenty of evil in humankind - amongst both women and men - but which also leaves no doubt as to what it means to be good, and provides consolation by showing us how good, and love, can endure even in the face of great provocation and suffering. - Joost Daalder"},{"Title":"Othello","review":"I love listening to British dramatizations of literary works! The Archangel Casts rendition of Shakespeare's \\"Othello\\" is extremely well done. Shakespeare's original text is read in a vibrant fashion, complete with sound effects and music. The themes of jealousy, revenge, racism, and deception are clearly evident.The primise of this play concerns a Moorish general in the Venetian army who is in love with a Senator's daughter, Desdemona. The couple marry, much to the anger and chagrin of Desdemona's father, Brabantio. Before the couple can consummate their marriage, Othello is sent to Cypress in order to defend the island from Turkish invaders. Desdemona pleads to be allowed to accompany him, and is granted permission. She will follow her husband in the company of Iago, Othello's \\"ensign,\\" or servant, who has his own agenda. Iago is bitterly angry with Othello for promoting an officer named Cassio to the rank of Lieutenant when Iago feels he is the one who deserves the job. Iago also believes that Othello slept with his own wife, Emilia. Resolving to be avenged, the psychopathically evil and manipulative ensign concocts a diabolical plan to convence Othello that Desdemona is having an affair with Cassio. What follows is a psychological drama in which Othello wrestles with doubts and confusion as he tries to learn the truth and ultimately descends into madness. Move over soap operas!The cast in this dramatization is excellent. David Threlfall is unsurpassable as Iago. His soft, seductive voice, (almost reminiscent of melting chocolate), simultaneously throbs with pretended concern and demonic joy. His soliluquies will chill you as you listen to his remorseless tones crescendo into jeering laughter. Anne Marie Duff is wonderful as Desdemona, providing the listener with a portrayal of innocence and heartbreaking sadness and fear. A special note needs to be made for Clive Swift who portrays Brabantio so well. Swift portrayed Richard on \\"Keeping Up Appearances,\\" and I enjoyed listening to him in a serious role.My only complaint about this production is Don Warrington who plays Othello. His accent is very thick, and it might help you to have a text of the play in front of you when he is speaking. This is the only reason I gave this dramatization four stars, but please do not let this put you off. The production is excellently done and should be listened to. Please give it a chance."},{"Title":"Othello","review":"This edition will be a boon for any instructor or advanced student who wants the usual Oxford treatment--extensive, thorough footnotes; wonderful appendices about music and performance; an excellent introduction that could stand alone as its own book; and well-chosen illustrations and photographs from performances throughout history."},{"Title":"Othello","review":"&quot;Othello&quot; is one of my favorite Shakespearean plays, but even the best of things could use a little updating once in a while.

I've been forced to abandon the endeavour because I simply can't bear the way the play is being destroyed by atrocious performances in the two major roles. David Threlfall as Iago simply butchers the lines; it's almost as if he's trying to sabotage the part. It's possible that he's intent on making the lines sound \\"naturalistic\\" and \\"modern\\" so he skates over his lines in a Yorkshire accent with no effort to elucidate their meaning, making the occasional emphasis of a word here and there in a seemingly random way. He clearly doesn't understand what he's saying. One out of many examples: in lines 43/4 of Act One, Scene One: he races over the words, \\"We cannot all be masters, nor all masters/Cannot be truly followed\\" by emphasizing the word, \\"followed\\" rather than \\"truly\\"! And this is typical: when he singles out a word, it is invariably the wrong one.And if Threlfall is execrable, Don Warrington as Othello is atrocious. Perhaps drawing the tenor of his performance from Othello's description of himself as \\"rude am I in my speech\\", Warrington reads his lines with an almost complete absence of expression! To hear him read speeches such as the \\"Her father loved me; oft invited me;/Still question'd me the story of my life\\" as though he's reciting \\"The cat sat on the mat\\" would be comical if it were a parody. However, this is an ostensibly serious offering! How the director let these actors get away with these performances is a mystery; surely he couldn't be so deaf to the meaning of the words as to give these desecrations the thumbs-up.The supporting roles are generally better played but then these can only slightly mollify the dismal impression made by the two main parts.

The cast is made up of &quot;distinguished actors,&quot; the insert proclaims, but it's obvious that these actors haven't done Shakespeare since they were in junior high school. Nor have they improved since then: none of the actors has any feel for the Shakespearean line. The speaking is stiff and mechanical, and half the time it sounds like a Monty Python farce!

Written around the 1600's, this play by William Shakespeare is best known for its tragic ending. In this play, betrayed by those he trusted most, King Lear is driven to the brink of insanity as his remaining power is snatched away. The dense rich language adds more meaning to the play, which is quite interesting due to the different twists in the plot, and the realistic portrayal of the diverse characters. This play, though hard to understand at times, is probably one of Shakespeare's best tragedies. This play is a \\"must read\\" book and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Here is the full plot of the play (read only if you already know the ending of the book):The play begins as King Lear, the ruler of England, is giving his daughters his kingdom so that they can rule. However, he wants his daughters to express their love for him, and in return he would give them the land. The eldest daughters, Goneril and Regan declare their love and receive their land. The youngest, Cordelia, says that words cannot express her love, and this angers the king. He says that he will give her no land and dowry and she is married off to the King of France.The scene shifts to another important character Edmund. Edmund is the illegitimate son of Gloucester, and he is creating a plan to trick his father into believing that his other son Edgar is attempting to steal Gloucester's wealth and then intends on killing him. This angers as he Gloucester and how he to kill his traitor son Edgar.As the play unravels, readers see that Goneril and Regan begin plotting to steal whatever power the king still may have. As the story continues, the daughters' evil plans are revealed to the king as he realizes the Cordelia was the only daughter loyal to him and he regrets the decision he made earlier. As the play progresses the king becomes mad with the knowledge.The play now takes place in Gloucester's castles and soon Goneril and Regan both fall in love with Edmond. Gloucester also learns the plans to the eldest daughters and he warns the king. After Regan and Goneril realize that Gloucester has told the father, they name him a traitor and torture him. In the end, Edgar saves his father.The king leaves and heads for Dover. This is where Cordelia is waiting for her father. However, both the king and Cordelia are captured and imprisoned by the other daughters. Goneril, in the blindness of her love for Edmund, poisons Regan and soon is lead into killing herself. Edgar and Edmund duel. Cordelia was killed in prison and the king soon dies afterwards and then the play ends."},{"Title":"Othello","review":"This is timeless Shakespearean drama, about a King and his three daughters, wrapped around corruption, betrayal and tragedy.

Um, she was the Queen of England. Not the wife of the King. The Queen. Albany was her consort.Lear was no longer the King. Regan was not the Queen. Cordelia was not the Queen. Goneril was. And had a Man with her attitude about power been the ruler, no one would think it strange.Yes, Lear is a tragic character, and it sure is tragic when he holds his beloved but dead Cordelia and asks if she is still alive.

I recommend it for anyone that has ever had to read shakespeare and not completly understood what they were reading."},{"Title":"Othello","review":"Othello is in many ways the most tragic of Shakespeare's heroes, because his ultimate destruction is somuch a function of his best qualities, as opposed to folks like Hamlet, Lear, and MacBeth, who aredestroyed by their worst. Othello is a noble warrior, but very much an innocent and far too trusting ofother men's counsel, and so he is easy prey for Iago, who in turn may be Shakespeare's greatest villain,because he is so purely evil. Richard III, by contrast, while a force of malevolence, is also just moreinteresting and intelligent than those around him. Iago has none of Richard's beguiling qualities, he islittle more than the sum of his own jealousies and hatreds. And so, when this noblest hero and thismost vile villain collide, the events that follow are tragic in the human sense, not merely in a dramaticsense. We mourn the loss of a superior being, in Othello, not just the general destruction of life.Othello is also distinguished by just how trivial are the provocations that set events in motion. Iagouses little more than a single prop, an embroidered kerchief, and his own treacherous words to bringabout a series of deaths and the fall of a great man. In this sense it is the most writerly of plays,reflects most fully Shakespeare's own confidence that he can take such slender threads and weave acompelling drama. One despairs of ever saying anything novel about Shakespeare, he's been writtenabout so much, but the thought occurs that Iago might represent Shakespeare himself. Consider that itis Iago's tongue and a flimsy plot device of his contrivance that force the action of the drama and hisjealousy of the handsome and much-heralded leading man that provides the motive. SurelyShakespeare, who so loved the device of the play within a play, might have relished the idea of a playthat's a simulacrum of his own profession? I like to think so.But in the final analysis, Othello does not capture us in the same way that some of the other tragediesdo. The main characters are so unambiguous that they lack a certain depth. The plot is so contrivedand so inevitable that it seems mechanical rather than natural. You can imagine a world in whichHamlet exacts his revenge without hesitating or where Lear realizes he's acting like a fool, but youcan't imagine a world in which Iago allows Othello and Desdemona to live happily ever after. That's apretty serious weakness.GRADE : B+"},{"Title":"Othello","review":"The recent Naxos AudioBook entry in their Classic Drama Series, &lt;Othello&gt; NA 320612), is so well directed by David Timson that it fairly boils along. Granted that some passages are read a bit too swiftly to be followed by those without texts open before them, but one gets the feeling that this is a play and not a 400 year old monument. There are moments, however, when one could use some extra noises-on, so to speak. When Iago gets Cassio drunk, a little more rowdiness from extras would be appropriate--but perhaps I am spoiled by too many film versions and certainly by the full chorus in Verdi's opera.Hugh Quarshie makes a more interesting Othello than a great one. He does not have that Paul Robeson voice that one tends to associate with the role, and he understands the part light years better than the Othello of that unfortunate film version a few years back. But his lightweight approach does not work when the mouth-filling flights of poetry make their demands after he is convinced of Desdamona's infidelity.Anton Lesser also makes a fine but not great impression as Iago. Perhaps he needs to use more variety of delivery when he is being &quot;honest&quot; with the other characters. After all, his approach to Othello should not be in the same key as that to Roderigo or even to Cassio. Iago is a supreme actor, so it takes an equally supreme one to play him.For once, we can hear Emilia (Patience Tomlinson) hesitate when she speaks of the &quot;lost&quot; handkerchief; although on a sound recording she cannot give us the body-language to explain why she betrays her lady for the sake of her husband. The Cassio (Roger May) is very good in the handkerchief scene with Iago and the hidden, miscomprehending Othello.The running time is just over 3 hours, 11 minutes longer than the venerable Shakespeare Recording Society with Frank Silvera as Othello and Cyril Cusack as Iago, now available on Harper Audio.

So he decides to divide his kingdom between his three daughters according to how much he reckons each of them loves and honours him. The two that don't love him at all, Goneril and Regan, go completely over the top and convince their doting father that they love him to death, which, in a way, as it subsequently pans out, they do; and the one who actually loves him, Cordelia, is so nauseated by her two elder sisters' gushing insincerity and venality that she says tells her father that she only loves him according to her filial duty as a daughter and no more. This causes Lear to totally lose it, disown her and banish her, upon which the King of France takes her on the rebound after she's dumped by the Duke of Burgundy because Lear's cut her off without a cent.There follows treachery, Lear's descent into madness, torture, gouged out eyes, people getting stabbed in the back, people poisoning themselves and various other unpleasantness; in the end, the heroine gets hanged after everyone has totally forgotten about her being in mortal danger because they were too busy chewing the fat; and the main character dies of a combination of grief for the death of his beloved daughter, the strain of strangling her executioner and carrying her dead body after his frail constitution has already been severely weakened.It goes without saying that with a little bit of meditation and mindfulness on the part of most of the characters in the play the whole sorry mess could have been avoided.Catharsis? Schmatharsis. It's depressing. And I'm in good company for thinking so. Even that old bardolator, Samuel Johnson, found the ending \`unendurable' and thought that it should be changed. And he generally knew what he was talking about. Cordelia should have been cut down in time and spared. Lear could have recovered and recuperated with some decent medical care to see his daughter married (after sorting out a mutually satisfactory separation agreement with the King of France) to the eligible young man who saved his life. Thus this gratuitously ghastly tragedy could have been turned into a splendid comedy with a happy ending and a wedding.What more could one ask for?It would have made for a much better play.

He was right. Perhaps he was right because &quot;Othello&quot; in his time had not yet fully enjoyed the fake aura of a &quot;master play&quot; that it has boasted ever since. &quot;Othello&quot; features the shortcomings and mannerisms of &quot;Hamlet&quot;, but without the benefit of the (sporadic) linguistic inventiveness that Shakespeare evinced in the other play (another of those wrongfully praised). In &quot;Othello&quot;, though, what we mostly see is an utterly improbable set of characters acting out in an affected, theatrical manner - even while pretending to deal with issues of real life, portraying genuine psychologies. Yes, there is lots of jealousy in this world, and murders do happen - but for anyone to fly off the handle the way Othello does in this play, one has to be supplied with much better and much more extensive corroborative psychologic evidence than what is offered to us in &quot;Othello&quot;! Instead, what we see is basically someone growing insane on the basis of getting to know bits and peaces of ludicrously circumstancial evidence, plus, thanks to a puppet cartoon character named Yago, some innuendoes and probings that are anything but devious or subtle. Yago's behaviour and aims are so obvious and laughable that one would think one was reading a comedy if everything wasn't presented to us in a deadly serious manner, clothed in the solemn literary forms of a tragedy. As a reader or viewer, you simply never get to enjoy &quot;Othello&quot;: instead, you spend your time working hard to swallow the improbabilities that the author presumes to present to us as having anything to do with life or human emotions. Similarly, the character of Desdemona is yet another prop on the stage; she serves to provide Shakespeare with more flesh to be disposed of at the end of the play. As in the similarly flawed &quot;Hamlet&quot;, there remains an artificially contrived heap of corpses left as the curtain falls down -yet as poetry, &quot;Hamlet&quot; still held some interest and therefore was to a degree palatable; by contrast, &quot;Othello&quot;, even as poetry considered separately from the drama, is unexciting and drab. To summarize, &quot;Othello&quot; is a wash-out. The present writer recognizes the right of the previous reviewers to find &quot;Othello&quot; worthwhile; but in the same way contrary readings should also be allowed to be voiced. If the present review could contribute ever so slightly to tarnish the impeccable image that &quot;Othello&quot; enjoys in most readers' minds; or if it at least prevented &quot;Othello&quot; from being listed in Amazon files with an absurd gross rating of five or even four and a half stars - then the present writer would feel vindicated; as well as recompensed for the hours he lost perusing &quot;Othello&quot;!"},{"Title":"Othello","review":"As dull as unbuttered toast; the only thing worth mentioning (briefly) is Ewan McGregor's Iago. Young, cheerful, well-spoken and winning, McGregor is the most charming Iago I have encountered in any medium. For awhile, that is very nearly enough. One understands why people like and trust this man; one also understands why no one takes him seriously as lieutenant material. But as the play progresses and Iago's cruelty deepens, McGregor's unvarying amiability seems incongruous. A strange countertextual interpretation emerges, reminiscent of Auden's trickster theory but with a novel twist of its own. In brief, Iago tries to play a harmless joke on Othello, only to see his prank spiral out of control. The poor man is forced to improvise desperately as he struggles to resolve the mess he unwittingly created. Iago as the Boy who Cried Adulteress, a feckless but innocent victim of events: that is indeed a novel take on the play, and it would be fascinating if it weren't ludicrous."},{"Title":"The Grace of Repentance (Today's Issues)","review":"An excellent work on the doctrine of repentance.

I definitely give it 5 out of 5 stars. This book is an easy read and very convicting. We take God's grace for granted in so many ways. We fail to realize that it is only by God's grace that we are even able to repent and turn to God.Sinclair does a great job of bringing that out and bringing to light the scriptural truth behind our sin, God's mercy in offering Christ, and God's grace in forbearing our sin and granting the grace of repentance to the Christian so that they continue to bear fruit in keeping with repentance (Matthew 3:8).It seems to have been lost in the last generations, but this book is a fresh Biblical reminder that repentance is not just a one time thing we do when God saves us, it is a lifestyle. Well said by Ferguson, \\"A life of repentance is ongoing, dogged, persistent refusal to compromise with sin.\\" (p.25).

I really enjoyed this book because it caused me to examine myself as I was reading and drew me to prayer. I've heard many of the points in this book before, but I don't think one can really get tired of hearing them; you never overcome your dependency on Christ and your need for God's counsel. I also really like the way Ferguson uses concrete images to explain his points and his use of sarcasm. If you're familiar with his style in sermons, the style of this book is similar. Ferguson looks at repentance in the Old and New Testaments and links it to our covenantal relationship with a holy, gracious and merciful God. He also talks about sin, what true repentance is, and how evangelicalism today has diluted the importance of it. Ferguson also looks back on the days of the Reformation and the state of the Church then. He points out that the call for all of us, individually and corporately, is to repent and believe the Gospel."},{"Title":"The Grace of Repentance (Today's Issues)","review":"The title of this booklet reveals something about the author's view of repentance.Repentance is part of God's saving work(It is only through God's enabling grace that anyone actually repents).Many who hold to the Non-Lordship view of salvation think of repentance as a work and therefore reject it as a necessary aspect of saving faith.Not only is faith God's gift to needy sinners but God grants repentance unto life as well.In chapter two 'Biblical Repentance' Sinclair Ferguson gives us the elements of repentance:1.A new attitude towards sin.2.A new attitude towards self. 3.A new attitude towards God.Although most of the clear thinking on repentance would consider 'living for self' as sin and repentance being necessary in the light of that. I've rarely come across denying self and taking up the cross included as an aspect of repentance.One thing Pastor Ferguson has in mind re-self denial is dying to sin(or putting sin to death-mortification of sin)putting off the old man.He helpfully exhorts the believer \\"it means not even thinking about how to gratify the desires of the sinful nature(Rom.13:14). Not ever.\\" This should not surprise us if we are familiar with what Christ says is necessary if we are to follow Him(we must deny ourselves and take up the cross)this is at the threshold of entering the Kingdom of God.Faith and repentance are the initial birthmarks of those who are recipients of the grace of God.Repentance takes longer at times due to the effects of sin.The author gives an example of this in David's life. Sin leads to folly and deceit. \\"...Sin makes us foolish. ...in my folly I thought that God did not see me or detect my thoughts.\\" It took Nathan the prophet to bring him to see his sin and then,by God's grace,confess and turn from his iniquity.In the Old testament,the language of repentance,is often connected with the breaking of His covenant and the need to return to the Lord for mercy.(He has promised to be gracious to those who have rebelled against Him if they forsake their idols and return to Him).Pastor Ferguson observes that the New Testament carries the covenantal overtones of the old but in a different way. \\"The covenant promise is no longer foremost because it has been fulfilled.In a sense the covenant is Christ.\\" The covenant has its fulfillment in the person of Christ.Sinclair Ferguson's 'The Grace Of Repentance' gives a very helpful overview of this teaching.It is a part of the series on 'Today's Issues' by 'The Alliance Of Confessing Evangelicals'."},{"Title":"The Grace of Repentance (Today's Issues)","review":"Sinclair Ferguson's The Grace of Repentance is a bit of a mixed bag. It is profoundly insightful when discussing biblical repentance. It is, in my opinion, less so when he draws an analogy between modern Evangelicalism and medieval Roman Catholicism. Even here, though, he makes many valid and very important points.Ferguson rightly bemoans the lack of biblical thinking on the matter of repentance and the nearly invisible role that repentance plays in the understanding of evangelism and conversion in some quarters of Evangelicalism today. He points to Luther's language in the first of the ninety-five theses as an accurate description of the New Testament understanding of repentanc:\\"When our Lord and Master, Jesus Christ, said \`Repent', He called for the entire life of believers to be one of repentance.\\"I agree.Ferguson argues that this is nothing short of the essence of biblical teaching on the matter, and he aptly supports this contention with strong scriptural backing. He demonstrates the seriousness of sin and the seriousness with which Scripture handles repentance. Furthermore, Ferguson argues against shallow contemporary notions of repentance that essentially reduce this important truth to a one-time, momentary, surface, emotional regret over sin. On the contrary, true repentance is a life-long journey and an opening of oneself to radical transformation and change through the indwelling power of the Holy Spirit. In asserting this, Ferguson helpfully marshalls a number of etymological evidences from scripture that illustrate the seriousness of the biblical call to repentance.In likening modern Evangelicalism to medieval Catholicism, Ferguson makes some valid points but also missteps as well. He offers the customary Reformed objection to the altar call as a kind of neo-sacramentalism, but this is needlessly overplayed. To be sure, the altar call can be, and often is, abused by well-meaning Christians. But it's all in the way it's handled and presented, no? There is nothinginherently misleading about giving people a place to respond to the working of the Holy Spirit in worship and, when handled rightly, there is much that is commendable about the practice. I would want to take Ferguson's cautions into account when considering how we handle the altar call, but I find what appears to be his dismissal of the invitation act (in worship) to be strained and unnecessary. This isn't the place for a defense of the altar call, but I believe a robust case for response-in-worship can, indeed, be made.Furthermore, his critique of the sensuality (for lack of a better word) of much modern worship is strained as well. Ferguson complains that:\\"Worship is increasingly becoming a spectator event of visual and sensory power, rather than a verbal event in which we engage in a deep soul dialogue with the Triune God.\\" (45)Yes, a lot of worship services have been reduced to spectacle, to a kind of theater for the senses. And, yes, there can be no doubt that the proclamation of the Word has been reduced and neglected in many American Christian churches. In this regard, he is right to voice his concern. I am not merely saying this to try to placate. On the contrary, the reduction of the verbal proclamation of the Word of God in many churches is a deep, church-weakening tragedy that must be addressed.But when Ferguson calls worship \\"a verbal event in which we engage in a deep soul dialogue with the Triune God,\\" does he mean merely verbal? How, for instance, does he explain God's call for rich sensory experiental worship in the Old Testament? Granted, worship in the New Testament church is substantially different as we proclaim Christ's fulfillment of the sensory acts practiced in Old Testament worship, but the strong presence of such elements in Old Testament worship at least establishes that the senses can play a part in helping the people of God grasp divine truth.What is more, In the New Testament, does not the Lord Jesus appeal to the senses when preaching outside and asking His audience to consider the birds? I rather suspect He might even have pointed to the birds when preaching this. This was no merely verbal event. And what of Christ's initiation of baptism and the Lord's Supper and His prescription of these sense-stimulating physical symbols for the Church? The ordinances appeal to the senses to further communicate gospel truth. What of the biblically prescribed singing of hymns, a verbal and melodic sensory act? What of the New Testament \\"holy kiss,\\" a non-verbal sensory act prescribed in the New Testament (a practice that has not - thankfully ((in my opinion)) - translated into our culture, but was, nontheless, a part of Christian life in the first century)?The reality is that biblical worship has never been a merely \\"verbal event.\\" In right measure and proportion, the senses can assist verbal proclamation to the glory of God. I understand the tradition from which Ferguson comes. I share it in part and admire it to a large extent. But worship is more than a \\"verbal event\\" and I fear that such denunciations may poison the well for what might be valid, church-edifying, gospel-promoting practices that do not deserve censure.Finally, Ferguson's effort to support the modern-Evangelicalism-equals-medieval-Catholicism analogy by comparing mega-churches with the construction of St. Peter's is the weakest of his efforts. Yes, certain analogies might be made, I suppose: the unnecessary fleecing of a people for the construction of an opulent cathedral, the satiation of an ecclesiastical despot's ego with the erection of a gargantuan edifice for his own glory, etc. Ok. I guess. The mega-church phenomenon certainly has its own dangers. But there are important differences as well. Most mega-church buildings, for instance, are built with the offerings of freely-associating members who choose to give. They are usually built when crowd size deems it necessary. In most cases, these structures are not built to house the cathedra of an Evangelical pope, but rather to provide space for a large congregation, etc. Of course, tragic exceptions are not difficult to find, but I suppose the question of whether or not these exceptions are the norm is a matter of debate. I doubt they are the norm.Ferguson knows this, of course, and he offers a caveat in the book to that effect. He is not trying to slam mega-churches per se. But one does wonder if there is enough meat here to even justify the assertion? Furthermore, what of Spurgeon's church in its day? It was the mega-church of the time and I daresay Ferguson would stop short of likening it to St. Peter's basilica.Please note that these weaknesses do not constitute the sum total of Ferguson's argument in this book. They are, in fact, rather peripheral to the central argument of the book. On the main, this book is a fantastic primer on biblical repentance and the need to approach it with a robust, scripturally-informed understanding. Even those few points I question personally are not totally without merit. They just need to be thought through carefully.In all, a helpful little book. I remain deeply appreciative for the writings and ministry of Sinclair Ferguson, and what he has said here concerning repentance has challenged me in substantial ways.I recommend it.Wyman Richardson[...]"},{"Title":"Dictionary of Environment & Ecology","review":"Although this is an interesting book to browse it has not worked well as a reference source for college studies.

So, Price Hal becomes King Henry V and this leads to the next play of that name.The wonderful Falstaff is also on glorious display. This is also the play with the famous tavern scene (Act II, Scene IV) that can be read endlessly with new enjoyment.Everyone has his or her own take on Falstaff and his treatment at the hands of Henry V, but I dislike it even though I understand it. Prince Hal and his transformation into Henry V is not someone I admire a lot. Nor is Falstaff's manner of living, but his wit is so sharp and his intelligence so vast that it is easy to still delight in him.But, you certainly don't need me to tell you anything about Shakespeare. Like millions of other folks, I am in love with the writing. However, as all of us who read Shakespeare know, it isn't a simple issue. Most of us need help in understanding the text. There are many plays on words, many words no longer current in English and, besides, Shakespeare's vocabulary is richer than almost everyone else's who ever lived. There is also the issue of historical context, and the variations of text since the plays were never published in their author's lifetime.For those of us who need that help and want to dig a bit deeper, the Arden editions of Shakespeare are just wonderful.-Before the text of the play we get very readable and helpful essays discussing the sources and themes and other important issues about the play.-In the text of the play we get as authoritative a text as exists with helpful notes about textual variations in other sources. We also get many many footnotes explaining unusual words or word plays or thematic points that would likely not be known by us reading in the 21st century.-After the text we get excerpts from likely source materials used by Shakespeare and more background material to help us enrich our understanding and enjoyment of the play.However, these extras are only available in the individual editions. If you buy the &quot;Complete Plays&quot; you get text and notes, but not the before and after material which add so much! Plus, the individual editions are easier to read from and handier to carry around."},{"Title":"The First Part of King Henry IV.","review":"First off, I must admit that I thoroughly enjoyed Part I and absolutely adored Henry V. Having said that, I found Part II to be enjoyable, yet perhaps leaving something to be desired - like more action. Falstaff and Prince Hal both come off as somewhat disingenuous and calculating Machiavellian individuals. Disappointingly, Falstaff speaks poorly of Prince Hal while unwittingly in his midst. Conversely, The Prince of Wales prematurely takes the crown before his King Henry IV's death as well as disassociating himself with Falstaff after he is crowned King. These instances, along with others throughout the play, show the self-serving tendencies of both characters.However, we can proudly witness the maturation of the young King from wild & dissolute young Prince Hal into one of the most revered monarchs in English history, King Henry V. Part II remains an intriguing play due to its paradoxical nature, yet unfortunately rarely acted out today. Now that I have read Henry IV(I&II;) for the first time, I gladly move on to one of my personal favorites, Henry V. I recommend both parts(Folger editions) for all Shakespeare enthusiasts - they have given me greater insight into the young Henry V - when he was more concerned with downing a pint of ale rather than downing the French at Agincourt.2 Magnificent Quotes from Henry IV Part II -\\"Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown.\\" - King Henry IV\\"He hath eaten me out of house and home.\\" - Mistress Quickly"},{"Title":"The First Part of King Henry IV.","review":"Believe it or not, Shakespeare's funniest play will be found in the Histories section of your Complete Works. That's not to say this is a comedy, but the group of characters gathering at the tavern represent the Bard's supreme comic achievement. Falstaff and the future King Henry V will have you laughing out loud. However, in the serious main plot, which picks up from the previous play, Richard II, the Percys are leading a rebellion against the usurping King Henry IV. The rebellion continues into the next play, but the Battle of Shrewbury marks an important point in Henry's reign, and serves as a fitting end to Henry IV Part 1. The play is a complete unity unto itself, but I recommend you read the complete series (Richard II, 1 Henry IV, 2 Henry IV, Henry V) in order to get the most out a very exciting and entertaining cycle. I usually recommend the Arden editions, but in this case the Oxford is superior. David Bevington is clearly one of the top editors in the field, and his notes help smooth over the rough spots in the text, especially the comic scenes which really need to be seen or heard to be fully appreciated.

Because of the inspiration it provides for any latter work involving a young male with 'daddy issues' (like \\"The Lion King\\") this play has had enduring power.The Prince of Wales, Hal, son of King Henry the IV is being thrust into power as his father dies. Conspiracies and the Crusades, a hysterical hostess and Falstaff, and the elevation of profanity to a high and refined art all add character to this play. I would argue that it is almost as much comedy as history.The most moving aspect of the play is Prince Hal understanding the reality that his father's death is thrusting upon him. From trying on the crown as his father lies unconscious but not dead to disavowing the rogues he had been a delinquent with, his growth is unmistakable.A very moving play and one of the more rewarding histories.E.M.

Hotspur has allied himself with several principal figures including his uncle the Earl of Worcester, his brother-in-law Mortimer the Earl of March, Lord Douglas the Scot, and Owen Glendower, a Welsh chieftain with a vivid mystical imagination -- he is so egotistical that he insists an earthquake that occurred the day of his birth was a divine proclamation of his importance -- and a desire to usurp all of Wales from the king.While he is preparing for war against the rebels, Henry IV laments that his own son Henry (Hal), the Prince of Wales, is a shameful libertine living the high life in London and consorting with a gang of scurrilous miscreants. Indeed, Prince Hal's idea of fun is robbing people, and his best friend and accomplice in this activity is Sir John Falstaff, who turns out to be not Hal's peer but a middle-aged man. In a character transformation of an abruptness that can only be described as magical, Hal becomes a serious young man determined loyally to defend his father's kingship from Hotspur's assault after he receives an earnest lecture from his father about the dangers of acting irresponsibly as a public figure.Not enough can be said about Falstaff, who is undoubtedly one of the most richly realized characters in literature. He is fat, lazy, cowardly, yet boastful, but not in the same way Owen Glendower is -- Owen really believes what he says; Falstaff is just trying to make himself look better than he actually is, but fools nobody because he prevaricates and embellishes without bothering to remember his previous lies for the sake of consistency. You probably know somebody like this in real life -- especially if you're ten years old. Falstaff's piquancy, in fact, so outweighs the stature of the other characters that his absence is sorely felt in the scenes in which he does not appear.Most of all, Part One of \\"Henry IV\\" is a play of contrasts personified by Prince Hal and Hotspur, who incidentally is also named Henry. In their confrontation on the battlefield, it seems unlikely that Hal, who wasted many of his best days living as a rake, could conquer a seasoned warrior like Hotspur in a swordfight. But there wouldn't be much of a tale to tell if not to show Hal triumphing after his resolution to change his weak habits, and the play ends with the conviction that, despite his past mistakes, he would make a noble king himself."},{"Title":"The First Part of King Henry IV.","review":"This is about Folger Shakespeare Library.

There's no question that Shakespeare fully appreciates military valor. The last play in the four part cycle, Henry V, testifies to this, not least with the famous \\"Once more into the breach\\" and \\"Band of brothers\\" speeches.But Shakespeare's greatest literary creation is perhaps the lovable rogue Falstaff. Falstaff is a Shakespearean fool, an anti-hero, a lovable villain. He voices opinions that no one would dare tell others. He can do this because he is a fool and isn't taken seriously by the king and princes above him. But audiences listen approvingly to his wisdom, and Falstaff thinks honor is for losers.\\"Thou owest God a death\\" says his friend Prince Hal as he leaves.\\"'Tis not due yet\\" says Falstaff left alone with the audience. \\"I would be loath to pay him before his day. What need I be so forward with him that calls not on me? Well, 'tis no matter; honor pricks me on. Yea, but how if honor prick me off when I come on? How then? Can honor set a leg? No. Or an arm? No. Honor hath no skill in surgery then? No. What is honor? A word. What is that word honor? Air - a trim reckoning! Who hath it? He that died on Wednesday. Doth he feel it? No. Doth he hear it? No.\\"King Henry IV faces a revolution led by Henry Percy known as Hotspur. There's no question that Hotspur is noble, valorous, courageous and of course honorable. Henry IV wishes that this Henry in fact were is own son, rather then the rakish prince also called Henry. This Henry Hotspur is full of fire and verve. Yet as honorable as he is, he fights on the wrong side and dies. There lies honor, vindicating Falstaff.Certainly Hotspur fights for a cause: he believes Henry IV to have usurped the crown, but he values martial honor above all, even above the deep love he feels for his wife. If a war serves a greater purpose, then the men who fight deserve our esteem, gratitude and respect. Honor is honorable. But if a man fights only for honor as an end in itself, he is a fool and in a just ordered world, he will lose.Vincent Poirier, Tokyo"},{"Title":"The First Part of King Henry IV.","review":"This edition offers a strongly theatrical perspective on the origins of The First Part of King Henry IV and the history of its interpretation. In their introduction the editors clarify the play's surprising, decentralized dramatic structure, questioning the recent assumption that the drama focuses on the education of Prince Hal.

Falstaff's unpredictable vitality is explored, together with important contemporary values of honor, friendship, festivity and reformation.

In \\"Part 2\\" we get to chew our spinach twice. Hal still stands at the same crossroads, Falstaff still tugging at his ankles.For me, that's the weakest element of \\"Henry IV Part 2\\", the warmed-over central plot. What makes \\"Part 2\\" terrific anyway is just about everything else. Structurally, \\"Part 2\\" is shambolic compared to \\"Part 1,\\" almost two stories entirely with Hal and Falstaff brought together only once, briefly, before the end. But individual scenes of the play shine with first-class Shakespearean luster, and \\"Part 2\\"'s thematic quality is singularly complicated in a way that confuses initially but rewards a second reading.Hal is still the prince, and still in poor odor with his father despite his heroics in \\"Part 1.\\" He must find his own way to glory while a civil war rages. Meanwhile, Falstaff schemes to take advantage of both the war and his friends for the sake of filling his gut.In the idiosyncratic way of this play, we begin with neither player onstage, but rather \\"Rumor, painted full of tongues\\", who sets up an opening scene featuring the rebel Earl of Northumberland, who as it turns out will play no major role in the proceedings and will leave in Act 2. It's like Shakespeare is playing with our expectations. Then he does the same to the characters. Time and again, we will see them tripped up by \\"smooth comforts false, worse than true wrongs.\\"Only Hal seems immune with his simple maxim: \\"Let the end try the man.\\"While Shakespeare worked hard to keep Hal at the center of things in \\"Part 1,\\" the character doesn't seem as well-integrated into the story here. The rebellion is dealt with this time without Hal taking an active part, or even being on stage. Falstaff carries the narrative bulk of the play almost entirely on his wide shoulders, his mischief providing amusing counterpoint to the cold-blooded realpolitik around him.Falstaff is helped this time by a supporting cast all his own, including slatternly Doll Tearsheet and Mistress Quickly, the latter of whom introduces the phrase: \\"Do me, do me, do me\\" to the lexicon of Shakespearean quotation. The humor is more ribald here than it was in \\"Part 1\\", and more morbid, too. The first Falstaff joke is that he had his urine tested and the urine is found to be in better shape than its owner.These episodes, and another where King Henry IV soliloquizes about his lack of sleep (\\"Uneasy lies the head that wears the crown\\"), are wonderful enough when read in isolation, enough to not mind that these story pieces never quite come together. The play's two masterstrokes both involve sharp reverses from what we have been led to expect, and though I feel the first is set up much better, they both leave an imprint on you while reading and line up with the message of \\"smooth comforts false\\" we were given at the start.A bridge between two better plays, \\"Henry IV Part 2\\" has its own special qualities and is very much worth reading - so long as you don't read it out of order."},{"Title":"The First Part of King Henry IV.","review":"\\"Henry IV Pt. 1\\" was one of Shakespeare's greatest successes in his lifetime, and has remained pre-eminently popular to this day. But each century has had its own version of what it is about.For Elizabethans, it was Falstaff and his merry pranks. For the 18th century, it was Hotspur and his proud nobility. More recently, the pendulum swung back to Falstaff, but this time as a tragic exponent of relativistic realism, a clown who understands his place as cosmic punchline.But as David Bevington points out in his introduction to my Bantam edition, the real central figure is the guy who encapsulates the best of both Falstaff and Hotspur, young Prince Hal. In \\"Henry IV Pt. 1\\", he is the dissolute heir to the throne, living the fast life of drink and crime (petty and otherwise) with the dubious aid of his pal Falstaff, a fat coward who lives only to fill his purse and gut. Can Hal break out of his seeming tailspin and aid his father, the title character Henry IV, before the king loses his throne in a civil war?Bevington's point is Hal represents the true center of this play, the character for whom Hotspur and Falstaff represent opposite ends of an ideal monarch. Not for Hal the opportunistic legacy of his grasping father, \\"this ingrate and cankered Bolingbroke\\" as Hotspur calls him, not without cause, early in the play. Hal must be his own self-made man, pulled from disparate parts, and \\"Henry IV Pt. 1\\" shows him at the start of his rather Machiavellian journey.\\"So when this loose behavior I throw off/And pay the debt I never promised/...By so much shall I falsify men's hopes,\\" he declares, less as a cunning rogue a la Shakespeare's Richard III and more as a cagey modern-day spin-doctor aware of how unsteadily his father's kingdom rests.Philosophy aside, \\"Henry IV Pt. 1\\" is a worthwhile reading experience because it is packed with so much fun. You have low comedy, battles, court intrigue, and fast-flowing dialogue with sharp twists and turns. \\"I can call spirits from the vasty deep!\\" brags the mystical Welsh rebel Glendower, to which Hotspur replies: \\"Why, so can I, or so can any man. But will they come when you do call for them?\\"Others seem more inclined these days to gravitate to Falstaff. I enjoy Falstaff's comedy, and his undeniable relativism sets him up as an Elizabethan figure more grounded in the 21st century than the 16th (\\"Henry IV Pt. 1\\" is set in the early 1400s, but was first produced around 1597), but as a personality he's about as callous as they come, at one point collecting a bunch of wretches to die in war so he can collect money from others who would have gone in their stead. Hal actually seems more attracted to Hotspur, the figure I find more compelling. Hotspur's an idealist, but entirely too mule-headed for serious statescraft. He's undone not so much by his enemies but his allies, including his shifting uncle and irresolute father.Hal here combines Hotspur's sense of a higher mission with Falstaff's pragmatic commonness to launch himself as a political man. \\"I'll so offend to make offense a skill/Redeeming time when men least think I will\\", he says early on. It's ironic how much more at ease Prince Hal would be in our era, running for office, than in his own, where the crown, if not attendant legitimacy, could be inherited. This is one of many things that makes \\"Henry IV Pt. 1\\" such a timeless pleasure."},{"Title":"The First Part of King Henry IV.","review":"Wordcraft: New English to Old English Dictionary and ThesaurusIf you only know Shakespeare by the fact that he existed and was a play writer and you decide that you want to read one of his history plays and the history play that you pick happens to be King Henry IV part one then just reading the text alone will be extremely confusing.

Northumberland surprises with a sudden spark, punning \\"Hotspur, Coldspur?\\" at the news that his son may be dead.Falstaff continues to be a magician creating reality from words. (This may be the main reason he is so fun to be around). Enigmatically, this corrupt liar, coward and a thief through and through manages to remain appealing. By contrast, our opinion of John of Lancaster is immediately sunk with the singular unseemly scene in which he cons the rebels.Of course, Falstaff is not as much a black magician as Richard III, who in a course of one speech, convinced Lady Ann, whose husband he killed, to be romantically interested in him. Falstaff's magic is not as sinister, but in it he is similarly effective, as when in a course of a short conversation, he convinces the Hostess, who is asking him to repay what he owes her, to lend him more.His prose does not make him as elegantly spoken as some better versed Shakespearean characters, but it is nicely of a piece with his remarkable internal freedom.Falstaff is fascinating: deeply flawed, he is appealing well beyond his deserves.

This brings us to the 2 \\"Henry IV.\\"Despite the title, the real star of this play is Falstaff. One minor complaint I have is that while Falstaff could probably handle the play, some of his scenes do get too drawn out. Moving on, Northumberland reappears, and he is of course sad over the death of his son Hotspur. (Slain by Prince Henry in 1 \\"Henry IV.\\") We also meet the Arch Bishop of York who becomes an enemy of Henry IV. The Arch Bishop delivers a striking passage that emphasizes that the past and the future always seem better than the present.In Act 2, we quickly learn that Falstaff has built up some debts and he is neglecting his duties to the king. (Big surprise!) Prince Henry is a back stage player for the early part of the play, but rather than being close to Falstaff (as he was in Part 1), he bitterly rebukes Falstaff for his lifestyle. Also, Prince Henry does express concern over his father's failing health. But he is afraid he will be thought of as a hypocrite if he shows it.Interestingly, a woman named Doll begins to find Falstaff attractive. King Henry IV does not enter until 3.1, and we can see that the rebellions have taken their toll on him. He can only talk of the tribulations of royalty. It is even possible that he feels he deserves these sorrow and afflictions for stealing the crown from Richard II. (Richard II's consolation prize.)Later, Falstaff gathers his men together in a well drawn comical scene. Westmoreland and Henry IV's son Lancaster defeat the rebellion of the Arch Bishop of York, Mowbray, and Hastings in a less than honorable way. But this is not an invention of Shakespeare's. It did happen.In 4.3, Coleville surrenders to our favorite rogue Falstaff. It is comical when Falstaff comments that Lancaster is so uptight because he doesn't drink. But the sad part of the play returns soon enough.Henry IV's health fails, and he can not enjoy his victory. (This does constitute a small consolation prize for Richard II.) Some people dislike Henry V for banishing Falstaff, but Henry V had little choice. The actions of Falstaff (as comical and lovable as he is) are downright criminal. Though, Shakespeare promises us that he will return in another play.

This play is clearly the dramatization of a struggle for a kingdom, but it is equally the story of Hal's wild and reckless youthful adventures with Falstaff and other disreputable companions.Shakespeare did not write his plays about English kings in chronological order, but these plays do have a historical unity. It is helpful (but not essential) to read the tetralogy Richard II, Henry IV Part 1 and 2, and Henry V in chronological order. Whatever route you take, I highly recommend buying a companion copy of Peter Saccio's &quot;Shakespeare's English Kings&quot;, an engaging look at how Shakespeare revised history to achieve dramatic effect.A wide selection of Henry IV editions are available, including older editions in used bookstores. I am familiar with a few and have personal favorites:The New Folger Library Shakespeare is my first choice among the inexpensive editions of Henry IV. &quot;New&quot; replaces the prior version in use for 35 years. It uses &quot;facing page&quot; format with scene summaries, explanations for rare and archaic words and expressions, and Elizabethan drawings located on the left page; the Henry IV text is on the right. I particularly liked the section on &quot;Reading Shakespeare's Language in Henry IV&quot; and Alexander Legget's literary analysis (save this until you have read the play). The fascinating article &quot;Historical Background: Sir John Falstaff and Sir John Oldcastle&quot; adds a religious dimension to the play that I had not previously noted.The Bedford Shakespeare Series provides an excellent study text (edited by Barbara Hodgdon) titled &quot;The First Part of King Henry the Fourth&quot;. It is a little more expensive, is about 400 pages, and provides a broad range of source and context documentation. It would be excellent for an upper level course in Shakespeare. The context documentation is fascinating and informative; it ranges from the Holinshed Chronicles to Elizabethan writing on Civic Order to detailed cultural studies of London's diverse populous. Other chapters address the OldCastle controversy and the &quot;Education of a Prince&quot;.I also like the Norton Critical edition (edited by James Sanderson), &quot;Henry the Fourth, Part 1&quot;, particularly for its extensive collection of literary criticism. The essays are divided into two parts: 1) the theme, characters, structure, and style of the play and 2) a wide variety of interpretation directed toward that roguish character, Sir John Falstaff."},{"Title":"The First Part of King Henry IV.","review":"When rating Shakespeare, I am comparing it to other Shakespeare. Otherwise, the consistent \\"5 stars\\" wouldn't tell you much. So when I rate this book five stars, I'm saying it's one of the best of the best.As a matter of fact, it isn't unusual for Shakespeare's \\"histories\\" to be more interesting to the modern reader than either his comedies or his tragedies; they fit the modern style that doesn't insist that comedies must have everything work out well in the end, or that tragedies must be deadly serious with everyone dying at the end, as was the convention in Shakespeare's time. Thus, this book has a serious plot, real drama, and blood and destruction, yet still has many extremely funny scenes. And as Shakespearean plays go, it's a fairly easy read, although in places the footnotes are still neccessary. The only caveat I will make is that one needs to remember not to consider Shakespeare's histories particularly historical; they have about as much historical accuracy as the Disney version of Pocahontas. Treat them as excellent stories based (very) loosely on history, and you'll do fine.It's a real shame that the language has changed so much since Shakespeare was writing that his plays are no longer accessable to the masses, because that's who Shakespeare was writing for. Granted, there is enough seriousness to satisfy the intelligensia, but there is generally enough action and bawdy humor to satisfy any connouiseur of modern hit movies, if only they could understand it, and this book is no exception. Unfortunately, once you change the language, it's no longer Shakespeare, until and unless the rewriter can be found who has as much genius for the modern language as Shakespeare had for his own. I don't think I'll hold my breath waiting."},{"Title":"The First Part of King Henry IV.","review":"Shakespeare's &quot;Henry IV Part I&quot; shows King Henry IV dealing with complex problems: England is in the midst of civil unrest, as the Percy family, angered by their treatment after unwittingly helping Henry IV ascend to the throne, threatens to depose the monarch. At home, Henry IV is despairing over the development of his son, Henry, Prince of Wales, heir to the throne. Prince Henry consorts with thieves, rogues, and scoundrels - his scandalous personal relationships seem to threaten the King's peace of mind more than the state of his kingdom.Aside from these larger concerns that frame the play, &quot;Henry IV Part I&quot; deals more with Prince Henry than it does with the monarch of the title. Throughout the play, Prince Henry is seen more amongst the rabble commoners than attending to matters of state. He is guided in his licentiousness by the enormously funny (pun intended) Sir John Falstaff, whose schemes and drunkenness are more innocent and endearing in Part I than they become in Part II.Falstaff's reckless and conceited behaviour casts a shadow over the entire play, symbolic as it is of Prince Henry's moral dilemma and of the precarious state of the nation. Falstaff instantly calls to mind Kenneth Grahame's magnificent Mr. Toad from &quot;The Wind in the Willows,&quot; and is Toad's direct literary forefather. Falstaff is the most interesting and dynamic figure in &quot;Henry IV Part I&quot; and certainly the most memorable character in the play.Prince Henry discovers that his responsibilities outweigh his fondness for Spanish wine, and is called to lead the King's army against that of the arrogant 'Hotspur' Percy, himself a rising political force. Their confrontation, brilliantly scripted and enacted, is central to Shakespeare's entire Lancaster-York saga, and should be read closely and with special attention.Of the two parts of &quot;Henry IV,&quot; Part I is by far the best and most flawlessly executed. The King's problems provide an adequate backdrop for the development of Prince Henry; 'Hotspur' is an excellent antagonist (with the whole Percy family offering a great contrast with that of the King); and Falstaff performs his role without dominating the play, as he tends to in Part II. Shakespeare does not need my praise or endorsement, but his &quot;Henry IV Part I&quot; blows me away. It is absolutely fantastic."},{"Title":"The First Part of King Henry IV.","review":"Henry IV remains one of my favorite Shakespeare plays, even though the tragedies and comedies get far more attention and seeming appreciation than do the histories. As an English major, I examined Henry's (Hal's) character, and I focused on his development from a somewhat foolhardy young man into a self-assured, even manipulative prince. It is hard to say which of these Hal truly is, or if he is a little bit of both.At the beginning of the play, Hal spends his free time cavorting around with his friend Falstaff (who provides all of the laughs in the play and is cited as one of the best comic characters in all literature). In the first act we already see hints in Hal's sololiquy that he may not be as carefree as we are led to believe, and that he might betray friends like Falstaff to be the prince that he is expected to be. Read on in &quot;Henry V&quot; to see just how much of a polished politician Hal becomes--his battle cries and his &quot;once more unto the breech, dear friends&quot; is masterful in its persuasiveness and ability to induce his countrymen to fight.Hotspur serves as a nice counterpoint to Hal in &quot;Henry IV.&quot; Hotspur is the hothead and Hal makes his decisions calmly and rationally. This almost inhuman rationality comes into play again in &quot;Henry V&quot; and makes you long for the seemingly carefree Hal.All in all, &quot;Henry IV&quot; is a great read and quite an interesting character study--I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"The First Part of King Henry IV.","review":"To get as much as you can out of this play, you MUST read &quot;Richard II&quot; first. Shakespeare deserves much credit for making the villain in &quot;Richard II&quot; (King Henry IV) the hero in this play. It is in this play that King Henry IV realizes political gratitude is short lived and Richard's prediction of Henry IV's trials comes true. Not only does King Henry IV realize that his seizing the crown came with consequences. but he also has to deal with his riotous son (the eventual Henry V). 3.2, where King Henry IV confronts his undisciplined son is quite memorable. Besides all this, Shakespeare introduces us to his comical Falstaff. So we have an interesting turn of events, dramatic confrontations, scenes of war, and comical touches. ENJOY!"},{"Title":"The First Part of King Henry IV.","review":"Of all Shakespeare's histories, Henry IV, part I is the best. It is the first of three plays that examines the ascension of the great King Henry V. Here, we see a young Prince Hal as a troublemaker and a &quot;royal pain&quot; (pun intended), who hangs out in taverns with drunkards and derelicts. But we also see a young man who realizes his destiny and knows that the time will come when he will have to be a strong king for England's sake. The play is more than just one person's rise. It examines English society in atime of great instability and civil strife. It examines the role of family (fathers and sons, brothers, and uncles and nephews). This play is a reflection of Shakespeare at his finest and everyone should read at least this play, whether or not they love Shakespeare or not. It is worth the read. (and it is a rather simple read, too.)"},{"Title":"The First Part of King Henry IV.","review":"I am actually reviewing both Parts One and Two with this since they should be read together.The reason why I enjoyed these plays so much is because we see Falstaff in both of them. He is my favourite Shakespearean character - big, bawdy, rough, a liar and a cheat, but again we know what he is right from the beginning, and Shakespeare keeps him so true to character. These plays are a bit different from some of the other histories. There are more comedic parts in them for one thing. The plays are certainly used as a medium for introducing young Hal (who will become King Henry V). We see him as a young man, and watch him grow and see the influences that his society and the people in it have on his development. He doesn't appear to be growing up well according to his father because he is so irresponsible. King Henry IV was not England's strongest ruler. He was haunted by his guilt over the death of his predecessor, King Richard II. In Part Two, comedy still plays a big role, and we still see Falstaff's influence on young Hal until the shocking moment of Falstaff's death. The best part about Part Two though is the deathbed scene between old King Henry IV and his son Prince Henry. The play leads us to \\"King Henry V\\". Prince Hal does finally grow up and he becomes a very strong leader. Actually King Henry Iv, Parts one and two should be read before King Henry V. It is the correct sequence and we see Prince Hal grow and mature."},{"Title":"The First Part of King Henry IV.","review":"Having just completed Henry IV Part I, I must say that I came away delighted and impressed with Shakespeare's genius once again. Shakespeare's ability to intertwine the arduous dichotomy of the impcomparable comedy of Falstaff and the meaningful history of Henry IV, Prince Hal, & Hotspur is impressive to say the least. It comes as no surprise that this was one of Shakespeare's most popularly staged plays during his day and enjoyed an unusually long stage run.Falstaff is undoubtedly the most infamously famous literary comic character in the history of English literature. The scenes of him being robbed by Prince Hal, feigning his death, stabbing the already deceased Hotspur in the leg while claiming victory, and his employment of beggars as his foot soldiers galvanize the comic aspect of the play and make for a hilarious & farcical sublot. Interestingly, in the bar in Eastcheap, Prince Hal alludes to his future persecution of Falstaff when he is crowned king.I strongly recommend Henry IV Part I to all Shakespeare aficionados seeing as I deem it in the top five of all Shakespeare's works along with Hamlet, Julius Caesar, Macbeth, & Henry V. Now on to Part II. Adieu.\\"The better part of valor is discretion.\\" - Falstaff"},{"Title":"The First Part of King Henry IV.","review":"Shakespeare's &quot;Henry IV Part II&quot; concerns the triumphant decline of King Henry IV, and the ascension of his son, Henry, Prince of Wales, to the throne as King Henry V. As in &quot;Henry IV Part I,&quot; Part II's main action concerns the attempts of the King to suppress civil strife, which is manifested once again in threatened rebellion. In &quot;Henry IV Part II,&quot; the rebels are led by Scroop, the Archbishop of York, the most powerful religious figure in England. The Archbishop's involvement &quot;turns insurrection to religion,&quot; thereby hoping to gain popular support and enlistment in the army against Henry IV.Henry, Prince of Wales, as the next in line to the throne, is expected to take a hard line against these threats, and lead the charge against the rebel forces. However, as in Part I, Prince Henry is nervous, as a young man will be, about accepting responsibility for himself, much less for an entire nation. A frivolous youth, he associates with the common folk in bars and taverns, led in his debaucheries by the notoriously comic Sir John Falstaff. The dichotomy between Prince Henry's father figures, the frail, but courageous King Henry IV and the robust, but cowardly Falstaff sets up the scope of the choice Prince Henry must make. His choice, he comes to realize, will affect the course of his country.The forces mount as the play moves forward - the King's army is ordered, well-equipped, and led by formidable generals - the Archbishop's army is made up largely of untrained citizens. The meeting of the armies' leaders in the Gaultree Forest of Yorkshire is the emotional and tactical climax of the play, and handled with dramatic precision by Shakespeare.The growth of Prince Henry, the shaping of his mind, his relationships with his noble father and brothers, as well as those with his low, vulgar drinking buddies, forms the focus of &quot;Henry IV Part II.&quot; Through five deceptively simple acts, Shakespeare illustrates the birth of a man and a king, and points the way to domestic peace. This is a play I enjoyed very much indeed, and would recommend reading alongside &quot;Henry IV Part I&quot; for maximum effect."},{"Title":"The First Part of King Henry IV.","review":"This is the play where the Percy rebellion begins and centers around the Achilles-like Hotspur. Eventually, Hotspur (Henry Percy) and Prince Hal (Henry Monmouth - later Henry V) battle in single combat.We also get to see the contrast between these young men in temperament and character. King Henry wishes his son were more like Hotspur. Prince Hal realizes his own weaknesses and seems to try to assure himself (and us) that when the time comes he will change and all his youthful foolishness will be forgotten. Wouldn't that be a luxury we wish we could all have afforded when we were young?Of course, Prince Hal's guide through the world of the cutpurse and highwayman is the Lord of Misrule, the incomparable Falstaff. His wit and gut are featured in full. When Prince Hal and Poins double-cross Falstaff & company, the follow on scenes are funny, but full of consequence even into the next play.But, you certainly don't need me to tell you anything about Shakespeare. Like millions of other folks, I am in love with the writing. However, as all of us who read Shakespeare know, it isn't a simple issue. Most of us need help in understanding the text. There are many plays on words, many words no longer current in English and, besides, Shakespeare's vocabulary is richer than almost everyone else's who ever lived. There is also the issue of historical context, and the variations of text since the plays were never published in their author's lifetime.For those of us who need that help and want to dig a bit deeper, the Arden editions of Shakespeare are just wonderful.-Before the text of the play we get very readable and helpful essays discussing the sources and themes and other important issues about the play.-In the text of the play we get as authoritative a text as exists with helpful notes about textual variations in other sources. We also get many many footnotes explaining unusual words or word plays or thematic points that would likely not be known by us reading in the 21st century.-After the text we get excerpts from likely source materials used by Shakespeare and more background material to help us enrich our understanding and enjoyment of the play.However, these extras are only available in the individual editions. If you buy the \\"Complete Plays\\" you get text and notes, but not the before and after material which add so much! Plus, the individual editions are easier to read from and handier to carry around."},{"Title":"The First Part of King Henry IV.","review":"My only complaint about &quot;2 Henry IV&quot; is that Shakespeare draws the scenes with Falstaff out too much (in my opinion). Falstaff is funnier than ever. King Henry IV's younger son Lancaster is a very striking figure. While his father is ill, he commands the forces against his father's enemies. 3.1 where King Henry IV contemplates the consequences of the crown he usurped from Richard II is quite moving. The scene where Lancaster crushes the last of his father's opposition is quite chilling. I can not overestimate Shakespeare's genious in how he handles Henry IV in this play. In &quot;Richard II&quot; his ambition and cruelty for the most part never ceased. In &quot;1 Henry IV,&quot; he showed himself to be a competent (and even likeable) king. In this play, he clearly regrets and suffers for his actions against Richard II. (Even if we remember his cruelty in &quot;Richard II,&quot; it is hard not to feel sorry for him at this point.) The scene where King Henry IV has his final talk with the eventual Henry V is one of the most moving passages in literature. King Henry V's complete reform is not only well drawn, but it helps prepare us for the next play, &quot;Henry V.&quot; But if you want to see more of Falstaff, remember he has the lead role in the later play &quot;The Merry Wives of Windsor.&quot;"},{"Title":"The First Part of King Henry IV.","review":"Shakespeare's play King Henry includes comedy, history, and passion.

Sadly for me my library didn't have A wizard abroad so i had to put it on hold from another library and had to wait a few days. it was torture!!!!!!!!!!! but the wait was well worth it and this has got to be my favorite book ever and i have read lots and lots of books. so you should read this book and hopefully you'll fall in love with it like i did and go crazy(not literally i hope) waiting for the next book to come out."},{"Title":"A Wizard Abroad: Young Wizard Series, Book 4","review":"&quot; A Wizard Abroad [wizardry series NO.4]&quot; this was not even a good book to go with the wizardry series.

And there are many things i hated about it i'll give you five examples. 1. There are few spells in it. 2. The spells where weak and pitiful. 3. Everyone is a wizard. 4. There are few battles. 5.

When I feel ill or upset I get them out and reread them because I love them so much. This is a perfect book and I whole heartedly recommend it to you - enjoy it."},{"Title":"A Wizard Abroad: Young Wizard Series, Book 4","review":"In this book Diane Duane returns from the heavily science fiction influenced \\"High Wizardry\\" to a book influenced by the legends of Ireland. 14-year-old Juanita (Nita) Callahan is sent to Ireland by her parents thinking that the relationship between her and her best friend Christopher (Kit) Rodriguez is getting too serious. Further her parents want her to take a break from wizardry. Little do her parents know that the aunt they send Nita to visit is a wizard herself, and the Emerald Isle is filled with the residue of thousands of magical events.In this book Diane Duane mixes the story of wizardry that began in \\"So You Want to Be a Wizard\\" with myths and legends of Ireland in an effective and intriguing way. An ancient ritual must be re-enacted to return the land to rest. In order to perform the ritual certain artifacts must be recovered. However, some of the artifacts have gone missing, perhaps forever. How can they be recovered in time to perform the necessary ritual? Along the way Nita must visit dangerous parallel worlds where she can easily become killed, and where ultimately many of those who are part of the ancient ritual will become killed.I prefer this fourth book in the series over the first three. There is a chance to explore Nita's character in more depth along with her maturity into womanhood. The mixture of her newly created Young Wizards mythology with the mythology of Ireland is interesting and fascinating. The story is complex, and thus occasionally confusing to the unfocused reader, but a reader captivated by the story will be well rewarded with Diane Duane's best story in this series to date. Well worth five stars.This story stands reasonably well by itself. However, I recommend reading at least the first story in the series, \\"So You Want to Be a Wizard,\\" and preferably the second story, \\"Deep Wizardry,\\" prior to reading this book. Reading the third book in the series, \\"High Wizardry,\\" adds little background information other than reinforcing the relationship between Nita and Kit."},{"Title":"A Wizard Abroad: Young Wizard Series, Book 4","review":"Ok, i loved it. it's my favorite in the young wizards series, of which i've read everyone but the first.(dont ask.) it takes place in irlend, which rocks, and has cool history in it. it's got lots of Darine, ho is cool, but not quite enough Kit, who is the best. Nita is the main charecter, for those who have read the others.PS i know I'D be jelous if i were kit!"},{"Title":"A Wizard Abroad: Young Wizard Series, Book 4","review":"Well, I really liked the first three books. This one was...a little harder. (All right, all right. I'm a chronic Kit fan, and find him completely underdeveloped and underused here.)The lowdown: Juanita (Nita) Callahan is furious when her parents send her to her Aunt Annie in Ireland for an enforced rest from wizardry...and, most of all, her best friend and wizarding partner Christopher (Kit) Rodriguez. They even make her promise she won't pop back to see him. (A Wizard can't break promises.) But there's rarely any such thing as a vacation for a wizard, and Nita is soon up to her neck working with Irish wizards to stop the past, myths, and memories of Ireland from destroying it.Duane has made excellent use of Irish geography, culture, and mythology here, and the ideas behind how wizardry works are always interesting. She usually does an excellent job of setting up her characters and conflicts.Unfortunately, Duane doesn't always follow things through. She takes great care developing Nita's relationship with the young Irish wizard Ronan and then introducing Kit back into the mix, but nothing seems to come of the whole situation? What does a kiss or two mean here...to Nita and to Ronan? Will there be further contact? Especially between wizards, isn't there more aftermath to physical intimacy with another wizard? How much does Kit know about it all, and how would knowing more change his relationship with Nita? Half of character is dealing with the consequences of decisions, and I was eager to see Nita deal with some of these questions only to find out they were never addressed.Part of the challenge here is that Nita's only fourteen, but has to act and think much more like an adult than you average teenager. People are counting on her and her wizardry. Though she's young, Nita's stuck with this kind of power and has to make adult decisions. We have to see the backlash of those decisions if they're to be meaningful. Not fair to her, but...that's wizardry.I was disappointed to see very little of Kit working outside his comfort zone here, when there were plenty of opportunities for developing him. Surely his family must have noticed his extended absences? As always, he's placed in a supporting role when he needs to develop on his own, too. He needs some tests of his own, not to mention that people seem to forget he's been involved in almost everything Nita has. (I was glad to see this book paid a little more attention to his specialities, though his contributions rarely seem to be critical.) So when do we get to see him dealing with his own problems, totally separate from Nita's? When does he get moody or mad, and why? How has he really felt about the interventions he's been involved in so far? What does he contribute besides an extra pair of hands? What does Nita appreciate about him, and what about him annoys or troubles her? Why do he and Nita seem to agree so easily on so many things, and where would they disagree? How committed are he and Nita to their partnership, and at what cost?Maybe future books will address some of this a little better. In any case, a pleasant read."},{"Title":"A Wizard Abroad: Young Wizard Series, Book 4","review":"One day I was looking around a local store when I noticed a book that looked interesting. It was titled \\"So You Want to be a Wizard\\". After reading the description, I figured I might as well try it even though it wasn't really my type. I loved it! After that I was totally hooked and bought the entire series. Wizard Abroad, the fourth in the series, is just as wonderful, if not better than the rest.In the book, Nita's parents send her to stay with her aunt in beautiful Ireland. There she discovers a huge problem. The layer between their time and dimension and others is so thin that things are beginning to leak through! With the help of some new friends and some old, she goes to battle with her old enemy, the Lone Power, who is stronger and more powerful than ever.Wizard Abroad showed some of the emotions real teens go through so that it seemed extremely realistic, yet was very imaginative and fun. Nita's time away from Kit in the beginning of the book gives Duane some time to focus on her character a bit more so that we understand more than ever what she is going through. Nita also finally meets a guy who sparks her fancy, the handsome, but arrogant, Ronan.Duane's extensive description of Ireland and skill in writing make this book one of the best I have ever read and I would recommend it to anyone who loves a good book."},{"Title":"A Wizard Abroad: Young Wizard Series, Book 4","review":"The first three books in the series are based on personal tragedy and struggle, where great things happen all across the world and it personally affects the characters lives and loves.After High Wizardry, where the battle was waged on behalf of the whole universe, it seems a little weak to suddenly be concerned with the fate of a single country again. Of course, the whole world is at stake, but the point is that the action takes place in Ireland, and the characters are primarily concerned with Ireland. It just seems so small scale after High Wizardry. It's like watching Star Wars Episode IV and then watching Episode 1. The scale is just far different.Another thing that bugs me is the lack of personal tragedy and struggle. The characters really don't seem to have anything huge happening to them that changes their characters or anything. The events of High Wizardry seem to have been forgotten or glossed over. Character Development seems to have simply halted in this story.Basically, the plot boils down to this formula: Nita goes to Ireland, discovers evil there, helps to fight it while discovering Irish Lore and Wizardry.If you like Ireland, you will enjoy that part of this book, because Duane puts a good chunk of Irish-ness into the book. It's Ireland meets Wizardry, which is good so long as you don't want anything new in the Wizardry department. In that regard, Duane has just taken things out of the previous books, stirred them up, and then redelivered them. Nothing really new to talk about here."},{"Title":"A Wizard Abroad: Young Wizard Series, Book 4","review":"I'm a big fan of Diane Duane's wizardry series, and A Wizard Abroad is my favorite in the series. While most of the series takes place in odd, uncommon places(under the ocean, far away galaxies), this one takes place in Ireland(with a few side trips to the land of the Sidhe.) When Nita's parents decide she needs a vacation from her magic and her friend Kit, they ship her off to Ireland to visit her Aunt. Her magic(and the Powers that Be), however, has other ideas. Nita manages to get mixed up in yet another battle with the Lone Power--this one, however, parallels Celtic mythology, probably one of the reasons I found this one so fascinating. NIta and Kit are here, along with some new, very interesting characters--including a cat bard. It's a fast-paced, enjoyable book that I highly recommend."},{"Title":"A Wizard Abroad: Young Wizard Series, Book 4","review":"I like to read, and wizards and stuff, this was one of the coolest books, It was neat.

And it's all starting on the country of Ireland. Nita knows she has to stop it, but what about Kit and her sister? Can she do it without them?Being Irish myself I was suspecious at first on how Ireland would be portrayed (you know the stero-typical pub-filled country with drunk people everywhere). I was surprised to see that it was shown in a good light, it really shone light on some of the old legends also. I was very pleased when I read it. It's a good book. So if you have read the rest of the series read this one!"},{"Title":"A Wizard Abroad: Young Wizard Series, Book 4","review":"A Wizard Abroad is a great book! I am 10 years old and this is the fourth book in the wizardry series that I have loved. I thought this because I like magic and it was very adventurous. Nita's parents think she needs a break from magic, and Kit, so they get her a trip to Ireland. She stayed at her Aunt Anne's house. It turns out that Nita's aunt is a wizard too, but Nita doesn't find that out until later in the story. One day Nita was looking at the sea and when she turned to look away from the sea everything was different. Then this cat called Tualha comes and Nita says ,&quot;What happened?&quot; Tualha answered, &quot;You went sideways in time and the way to get back is to look back at what you were looking at before this happened. The day after that Nita found a friend, Ronan, who was a wizard. When Nita went home she found out that her Aunt was a wizard. Her aunt told her all that was happening. Her Aunt told her about the 4 treasures of the earth and how they would have to reenact the war with the Fomori and Balor, for things to be normal. In that war they used all the treasures to defeat Balor. In the end Nita, Kit, Ronan, Dairine, and a lot of other wizards defeated the Fomori and Balor."},{"Title":"A Wizard Abroad: Young Wizard Series, Book 4","review":"This book was okay, but definitly not the best in the series. Actually, let me rephrase that. The parts about Ireland were cool, but just about everything else in this book was not very good compared to the other books in the series. Not that this book lacked exitement. In it, Nita's parents send her to Ireland to be with her aunt, in order to seperate her and Kit so they aren't spending so much time together. Once she gets there, she discovers that her aunt is also a wizard, and so is just about everyone else, including some irritating boy that Nina meets and likes. The worst part is that whole kissing scene between her and that boy. Not only was it totally gross, but also it disgusts me because Nita is way too young, and it's not like the relationship would last. That may sound really lame comeing from a fifteen year old, but lets face it, it's true! This is an okay finish to the saga, but it isn't really neccacary if you don't want to have to put up with the flaws I mentioned."},{"Title":"A Wizard Abroad: Young Wizard Series, Book 4","review":"This book was good -- but compared to the first books of the series, it was a disappointment. High Wizardry was a little anticlimactic after Deep Wizardry, but A Wizard Abroad . . . just didn't quite have the same sparkle. There was too much focus on Nita's relationship with a boy she meets in Ireland, and not enough on the main plot. Are we really that interested in Nita obsessing over the guy she met at the chicken place? Personally, I'd rather see her more focused on her work.Nevertheless, the story was still good, combining science fiction with mythology and fantasy. If you've read the other books, you ought to read this one anyway."},{"Title":"A Wizard Abroad: Young Wizard Series, Book 4","review":"I know these books are written for youth, but I thoroughly enjoy them at 77!

This series is at least not as dark as the Harry Potter series, for exampleHarry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (Book 1), which has the kids somewhat younger than Duane's folks. The author seems to do very good research. Her characters say things that are in character. Her wording is very well crafted. Plus, she writes a good story. Other people reviewed content, I won't go into that. This is a story you could read to a tween, and they would enjoy it. I enjoy these stories, as an adult. Somehow kid's books are deeper than much of what is written for adults- they reach deeper into the mind, and so on.

I read this series back before Harry Potter was a worldwide phenomenon and I can say this is a book I always come back to. I loved the interweaving of Irish folklore with wizardry, loved the build up between Nita and Ronan and the entire fish out of water sense the book entailed. This was one of the books that inspired me to study abroad in college (an experience I fully recommend!) and to look at any problem I had from a different perspective.I'd forgotten about this book until I stumbled across the audio version at my public library and couldn't help myself. I still recommend the written version, I was less than impression with the audio version. She makes Nita sound like a whiny eight year old rather than an early teen and Kit like a full grown man. I wish I hadn't listened to the audio and could preserve the wonderful memories I have of reading this book and imagining the story.Read it."},{"Title":"A Wizard Abroad: Young Wizard Series, Book 4","review":"So predictable...

In truth this should have been his story, and He, not Nita, should have been the one to tell it.As it is we get the view from the outside, with a narrator who isn't quite perseptive enough to give us the whole story. And if Nita's place in this story is somewhat periperal then the other young wizards from the previous books are even more so.Kit is the proverbial 3rd wheel, and Dairine is used as nothing more then a convnient power source.I loved the first two books inis series, was disappointed by the third and am sad to say that the story line hasn't recovered in the Fourth. Like its imediat predesor this book feels like the darkness has delibertly been toned down, and frequently omitted, preferring to report the fighting with passages about what Nita remembered rather than dropping us into the thick of it.As a result I just couldn't find anything to get involved with in this story,"},{"Title":"A Wizard Abroad: Young Wizard Series, Book 4","review":"this series is reall good and great fun, rather on the lines of harry potter...I highly recomend, NOT just for kids."},{"Title":"A Wizard Abroad: Young Wizard Series, Book 4","review":"I discovered this book by my friend.

The young human wizards of this world suffer from diminished powers as they grow older, so as Nita and Kit mature they become more interesting as characters but less interesting as wizards. In fact, they do very little wizarding here (as in HIGH WIZARDRY, Nita's little sister Dairine remains the champion power spellcaster).Nevertheless, Duane's picture of contemporary and legendary Ireland is fascinating, as are her incidental characters. Did anyone else figure out who Aunt Annie is?"},{"Title":"A Wizard Abroad: Young Wizard Series, Book 4","review":"This book is excellent! i read it first when i came across it in my library, then i read deep wizardy, high wizardy, and so you want to be a wizard, ( i know, out of order!) and i think all are great. all i can say now is: WHEN IS THE NEXT IN THE SERIES COMING!!!!!!!!!??????????"},{"Title":"A Wizard Abroad: Young Wizard Series, Book 4","review":"I discovered Diane Duane's &quot;Wizard&quot; series a year ago and have just finished reading this fourth book in the series. I was very eager to find out the latest developments in the relationships among the three main characters-- Nita, Kit, and Nita's sister Dairine. As a Young Adult writer, Duane does an excellent job of realistically and sensitively portraying the emotional growth and development of these teens. They are very believable and likable people. However, as a story in itself, I feel that &quot;A Wizard Abroad&quot; lacks the depth and scope of the plots in the three earlier books. The fourth book makes too many references to events in the earlier books, and the battle with the Lone Power seems pallid and repetitive now. While the Celtic references are interesting, Duane doesn't really do much to further advance or explore her wizard ideology (which, as I am an adult reader, is one of the most fascinating aspects of the other books to me). I recommend this book only if you have read the other three books and really enjoyed them, as I did. You won't be able to stand not knowing what will happen next!

Nonetheless, Juanita is packed up and sent to live with her aunt in Ireland for six weeks until school starts.

It's up to Nita, Kit, and a few new characters to gather the tools they need and re-enact an ancient battle, or accept their fates.

I was caught by the cover and title and took it home with me. Despite plunging into #4 without any background on the series, it wasn't hard to pick up and follow - the story in this book stood on its own and didn't require a lot of 'flashback' referencing.The writing is strong enough - and well-suited for the teenage crowd that Duane seems to be targeting. The magical adventures and lore is interspersed with teen angst and qualms, \\"Not important stuff, like kissing -- how do you do it and still breathe? Is not wearing a bra a come-on?\\"Much more adult than the Harry Potter series, Duane goes right into battles with thick descriptions - and death in tow, not shying away from the facts of things. She also takes the time to tuck in the myth, history and lore that flush out the story.A good read - I'll take the time sometime to go back to #1 and roll forward.However - the writing here should steer readers to progress toward similarly crafted books by Alan Garner, Madeleine L'Engle, or Ursula K.

'You mean the ghosts.'Nita stared.'Welcome to Ireland,' said her aunt.\\"- tea with the Callahan familyAt a minimum, read SO YOU WANT TO BE A WIZARD (which introduces Nita, Kit, and to a lesser extent Nita's sister Dairine) and HIGH WIZARDRY (which further develops Dairine) before tackling this book. If you haven't read them yet, shoo.Unlike several of the later Young Wizards books, in A WIZARD ABROAD only Nita Callahan is a viewpoint character, for the very good reason that her parents are behaving as one might expect good parents of a fourteen-year-old wizard to behave. They're worried about this magic thing, worried that their daughter has a very close relationship with a boy her own age (Kit, her partner in wizardry), and they want Nita and Kit to take a break from each other. In short, they're packing Nita off to her aunt in Ireland for the summer, after extracting a promise that Nita won't use any transport spells to visit Kit on the sly.(In my perhaps jaded opinion, the wizardry isn't the most fantastic element about the story. That honour goes to Nita getting a passport without her having a great deal more advance notice about the situation. A close second would be that Nita's parents don't telephone her regularly.)The point that Nita can't at first make clear to her parents is that the Oath is for life, and she'll still be a wizard in Ireland just as much as if she were back home in Nassau County. The point that Nita herself has overlooked is that her wizardry comes from her father's side of the family, which makes staying with his sister more interesting than anticipated. :) And taking a break from Kit - though not quite as her parents had in mind - does have some effects, since Nita now has a chance to work with different wizards near her own age.Like its predecessor, DEEP WIZARDRY, this entry in the series explores how wizards who don't come from Nita's particular background may interact with their wizardry differently (as well as, of course, a dire emergency coming up; being a wizard is analogous to being a fire-fighter that way, in that emergencies are a way of life). As with the whale-wizards of the ocean, Irish wizards don't use a manual in book form, but rather have a more bardic tradition of carrying magic in memory. They've also got different problems than wizards in the New World do, the equivalent of magical toxic waste having accumulated from many centuries of magic use and sharing the land with the Fair Folk, non-humans who have their own traditions.This volume may require some mental adjustments on the reader's part, since a certain amount of Gaelic dialogue happens, as well as Irish legends being filled in by stories-within-a-story."},{"Title":"A Wizard Abroad: Young Wizard Series, Book 4","review":"I discovered this book earlier this year, and I thought that in comparison to the other books in Duane's Young Wizards series (So You Want to be a Wizard; Deep Wizardry; High Wizardry) this was not as spectacular. If you are into mythology (especially Celtic myth) this is perfect. I had to read this book twice to understand some of the myth, and the magic in this book is very different than the solo/partner efforts of Kit and Nita in the previous books.

She's been to the bottom of the Ocean and the far reaches of the universe, but this time she's going someplace even stranger: Ireland.Ireland for a wizard is a dangerous place; it's steeped in magical powers, creatures, gateways to other worlds, and dangerously overlapping areas of old spells. And it seems that Ireland has become the center of a growing disturbance that will consume the whole world unless Nita and the other wizards of the area can come together and awaken the powers of country's sacred magic objects. And to think that Nita's parents were just sending her here for summer vacation! A wizard's work is never done.After a bit of a dip in quality in the previous book, \\"High Wizardry,\\" Diane Duane bounces back in this wonderful trip through the mythology of Ireland. Duane lives in Ireland and has extensive knowledge of the land and its legends, and she helps to create a vivid, living picture of the Emerald Isle as seen through Nita's eyes. As usual with this series, the story walks a thin line between ancient magic and modern attitude. Imagine what our world would be like if Celtic gods suddenly jumped into the middle of our cities, and you have something approaching Diane Duane's style in this book. This is, however, the most traditionally high fantasy novel of the series, with less focus on the pseudo-scientific magic background that dominates the earlier books. We're on familiar medieval fantasy ground here with the gods and spirits of Ireland (and there's a glossary to help out), and people who loved the scientific aspects of the first three novels may not enjoy this one as much. In general, however, this is one the quickest moving of all the books and the scene setting is superb.Nita takes center stage; her sister Dairene and wizard partner Kit only appear in certain sections. Nita has grown a lot since the series started, and for the first time she faces the possibility of genuine romance with a boy -- a handsome Irish wizard named Ronan. Unfortunately for both of them, Ronan's part in the adventure might be larger than they guess.For anyone who has enjoyed the Harry Potter novels, the entire \\"Young Wizards\\" series is highly recommended (it starts with \\"So You Want to Be a Wizard.\\") Be warned, however, that this is definitely a different kind of reading experience, and you may be hooked."},{"Title":"A Wizard Abroad: Young Wizard Series, Book 4","review":"This is one of my favorite books. The whole concept of unknown magical beings is very interesting to me. I found this book and the three before it very creative stories. Diane Duane is definitely one of the greatest writers of wizarding books right after J.K. Rowling. I have only one complaint, Where's the next one?????"},{"Title":"A Wizard Abroad: Young Wizard Series, Book 4","review":"A Wizard Abroad is not a poor book, but it is probably my least favorite in the series at the moment. At another point it was my favorite, though, so that means little. It has some very high points, and some parts that I would have liked to see explained better.Low points:The Lone Power. In the previous book (High Wizardry) the Lone Power stops being evil, although It warns that as the Powers are beings outside of time, its evil \\"past\\" self is still extant and dangerous. But now, when the Lone One's incarnation of Balor, there is no impact at all. There is no mention of the bright side of the Lone One, although it could have been worked in. I would have liked to know if Nita was thinking of the paradox.The first three books were almost a trilogy. I'm glad they weren't- there are WAY Too many trilogies as is- but this book may suffer because it's jsut after those. The nature of the trilogy changes, the nature of wizardry changes, and this is the transition between the power of the first 3 books and the finer, less-brute-force wizardry of the latter ones.High pointsI loved the Irish myths in this book. I had heard of Cuculain and Emer. (Cuculain was a hero, whose name means \\"Hound of Culain\\" for the time he spent defending Culain's house in place of Culain's hound, which he had killed. Emer was his wife- as usual, the most beautiful woman in the world; not so usually, a woman so wise that few people could understand her. Fortunately Cuculain was one of those people, because they carried out their courtship in riddles.) Anyway, I'd heard of them, and been glad that one myth heroine at least was intelligent. I liked meeting her in this story.The sidhe are described very well, and hte word fairy/faerie is never used. THat's good- no silliness. These people are powerful, and while they definitely aren't evil, neither are they safe to be around.The story itself is based around Irish myth and legend- the Treasures, the battle of Moytura, Tualha's (she's a cat-bard) stories, and the villains.Nita does not get into a romance. I am a teenager, even though I'm using the kid's format, and I am really sick of omnipresent romance. Nita and Ronan kiss once before he runs off because she reminds him of the bright Power \\"Michael/Lugh/Thor/Prometheus/Athene/Peach (yes, Peach: she appeared in the last book as a machaw)\\".Mixed, but good."},{"Title":"A Wizard Abroad: Young Wizard Series, Book 4","review":"Nita's parents were probably right to be concerned. For a 14-year-old young woman she was spending altogether too much time with one young man. Even if Kit was the only other wizard in the neighborhood, and all the two ever did was to practice their wizardry and go on quests. But parents rarely listen to reason when their worried, and so Nita is packed off to Ireland to spend six weeks with her aunt Annie. A nice break, they think, from all the pressures of wizardry and, er, boys.And so it would have been is half the legends of Ireland weren't suddenly reappearing, and being nasty about it as well. Something has wakened Ireland's spirit world and Nita quickly discovered that Ireland's wizards were up to their neck in conflicts with the Unseelie Court. Magic in Ireland is a differenct thing entirely from what Nita is used to. There is so much magic laying about from that countries long history that a spell cast without forethought can have disastrous results.Somehow Balor, king of the Fomori and possessor of an eye that will surely destroy whatever it looks at, has woken, and now plans to complete his old plans for conquest. The wizards determine that the best way to oppose him is to re-enact the battle of Moytura, in which he was originally defeated. For this they will need to awaken four magic artifacts, the cauldron of rebirth, the sword Fragarach, the stone or destiny, and a spear called Luin. Only with these things have they a chance against the dark magic and evil aspect of Balor's deadly eye.If that may be Nita's biggest problem, it is hardly the only one, for true to summer vacations she finds another wizard whom she likes enough to kiss. This is all the more unsettling in that her relationship with Kit is still a bit undefined. This becomes more confusing when Kit himself manages to appear and Nita must deal with strong feelings for the first time. Between romance, the quest for the treasures, and the impending battle, Nita has a lot to deal with.While this isn't as emotional a story as the previous three books, Diane Duane keeps your interest by a careful mix of personality and the arcane history of Ireland. Things are serious, but there is always a light humorous touch to relieve the impending darkness, including a kitten bard who can climb chimneys when needful. Once again Duane proves that books for young adults don't have to be childish."},{"Title":"A Wizard Abroad: Young Wizard Series, Book 4","review":"I found the fourth book of this series a sad departure from what made the previous books great. It moves the overall story line further, but its a step i wish i could have skipped"},{"Title":"A Wizard Abroad: Young Wizard Series, Book 4","review":"(Yes, I know it's just a book).The fourth installment in the Young Wizards series continues Miss Duane's tradition of excellent writing. I've always wanted to visit Ireland myself and reading her description of the places there made me want to visit even more. She really does seamlessly interweave the real world with the fantasy world in such a way that it is easy to believe and in fact you WANT to believe and you hate coming to the end of the book so soon and you go out and buy the next book. Or, if the next book is not handy, you go back and reread your growing collection. For as long as it takes.A quick note on the amount of magic in this book -- there's less spellcasting and whatnot (although the forging of a certain item near the end of the book is incredible) because it's overshadowed by IRELAND. I mean, IRELAND IS the magic in the book. And it's tough for even the strongest wizard to compete with that."},{"Title":"A Wizard Abroad: Young Wizard Series, Book 4","review":"Nita Callahan isn't quite 15, and she's a wizard. She and her friend and partner, Kit Rodriguez, have already saved the world at least three times (see the previous books in this excellent series, and my review of \\"A Box of Wizadry\\"). Unfortunately, her parents are mundane, and they don't understand. Whether or not they really think she and Kit are up to hanky-panky, as Nita is sure they do, they're determined to get her away from \\"all that.\\" So they send her to County Wicklow to stay with her aunt, Annie Callahan, for six weeks. What they don't realize is that Ireland is top-heavy with old magic--there's hardly a square foot of it that isn't overlaid with the residue of enchantments and workings reaching back thousands of years--or that Annie is herself a wizard. Nita soon discovers that the Powers That Be *want* her to be there--along with Kit and kid sister Dairine, whose powers are even more impressive than Nita's but who at least doesn't have a male partner--to once again beat off the incursions of the renegade Lone Power. And she even meets an Irish boy with whom she shares a first kiss. Duane's great gift is to blend the \\"weirdness\\" of magic so perfectly with everyday life that it seems utterly acceptable, even though her magic tends to be highly technical--the reverse of Arthur C. Clarke's famous dictum, \\"Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.\\" Nita fights off a pack of dire wolves, calls the Faery-Folk to cope with an invasion of drows, and eventually imports Dairine to help recreate the Spear of Victory, one of the great magical treasures of Ireland, by literally reaching back in time for iron plasma from the heart of a star! Duane herself, if memory serves, lives in Ireland, and obviously enjoyed putting her home into her work. An excellent addition to a superior YA series which can be equally well appreciated by adults."},{"Title":"A Wizard Abroad: Young Wizard Series, Book 4","review":"This fourth book in the Young Wizards Series is still very good. Duane created characters that are very believable. Some of the plot even displays the way Nita matures throughout the years. Once again, the plot is very original, very creative.However, I just have a few complaints:A Wizard Abroad still contains the same formula as the others, good yes, but unfortunately it can get a bit tedious after awhile when you have an idea of what is going to happen. Moreover, the climax is very confusing. Readers beware: it is very very easy to get lost in all that description. Things happen just too quickly.Nevertheless, this fourth addition is still quite magical, and quite good."},{"Title":"A Wizard Abroad: Young Wizard Series, Book 4","review":"I was disappointed at this book, because the previous ones had been great. At first I thought that the plot could really turn into something big, but then it just fizzled out. The battles just didn't have the same impact as they did in the other books. In the other books, you really felt the importance of all of the battles, because you felt like the whole universe depended on the outcome of one battle. With this, it was sort of like, okay, so what that there's a battle. I finished the book, but mostlly because I felt that if I didn't read it, I would be majorly confused in the next books. It was sort of like she just stopped writing the book, and had someone else write it for her because she didn't want to write it. I would not recommend buying this book alone, because its biggest value is having information that you would need in the next books."},{"Title":"A Wizard Abroad: Young Wizard Series, Book 4","review":"A wizard abroad deals with Nita's expiriences while staying with her aunt. Just the right touch of romance and as you read the plot thickens you won't be able to put it down and the same web that trapped me while reading it will envelope you until you finish. Then, you will wish it had been longer! I highly recomend this book to teens."},{"Title":"A Wizard Abroad: Young Wizard Series, Book 4","review":"love it if you want a good book about wizardry this is it my mom likes it to its good for grown ups too i was in a like state where nothing could break me from it and i play like i am nita some times what she does with the lone power is incredible"},{"Title":"A Wizard Abroad: Young Wizard Series, Book 4","review":"i received this book for christmas having never heard of it i was a bit &quot;if'ie&quot; to start reading. turns out that i was totally wrong! this is one of the best books i have ever read.

As with all Duane's books, it manages to be accessible without being condescending, and it is a YA book that can be happily reread by those of us who no longer fit the age bracket."},{"Title":"A Wizard Abroad: Young Wizard Series, Book 4","review":"With Diane Duane's Wizardry Series...each book is better than the previous one. In this installment, Ms. Duane pierces more into the insight of the Powers that Be and lets us all know there are wizards everywhere...just not in America. We also get to see how a teenage girl grows and develops from being &quot;shipped off&quot; by her parents to a whole new world.

However, after getting to know Mary Catlett so well and then not seeing their relationship develop (because the book was essentially over by then) was a bit of a bummer. I understand the focus of the book was on \\"longing,\\" but come on, us romance lovers want to see what happens when they finally get the person they've been longing for!On the other hand, I was impressed with how well the author showed John Newton's life while he was still living as an infidel. Sometimes the content was PG rated (but I liked that point because it gave me--the reader--a better sense of the character's view of the world) so I wouldn't want a bit of that content changed. John Newton was truly wretched and I think the author was very effective in communicating that point. The scene where he was in the midst of that horrible storm and he started to remember what people told him about God...and how he thought he was going to die, was very effective.But then he FINALLY sees Mary after all that time, and that's it! I wanted to scream \\"wahhhh\\" over that point. I really liked Mary and actually hoped she'd end up with the Viscount Alexander Todd because he was such a fabulous man who loved the Lord. It made me sad when the Viscount finally realized she would never love him until her affections toward the missing sailor John Newton resolved. I wonder if Mary would've married the Viscount if she'd known what John had been doing in the Ivory Coast prior to returning to England. I wish the story would have either left out Mary altogether, or showed at least one chapter of their reunion after he returned to England. That would've made it a five star story, but since that didn't happen, I'm ranking it lower. It was an excellent read otherwise."},{"Title":"The Longing Season (Music of the Heart #2)","review":"High school history books should be this beautiful; I would've done so much better on tests.\\"The Longing Season\\" is written as a fully fleshed story wrapped around historical facts. The hand and love of God within the stories of Horatio Spafford and John Newton fill me with wonder. Schaub tackled Spafford in \\"Finding Anna,\\" her previous novel. Fictionalized accounts of historical people bring their testimonies to life and end up teaching us more than bare facts.Schaub takes her time and develops the characters in a style closer to literary than pop fiction. She has painted a realistic and almost shocking hero in John Newton. The story behind Amazing Grace has always intrigued me, and that was before I knew of the separation and longings of two young people who communicated not through instant messaging but by letters written and transported by ship.If you are a fan of Jack Cavanaugh's \\"Storm\\" you should find much to appreciate in \\"The Longing Season.\\"If you yawn at richly woven prose and descriptions or at hymns, you might not appreciate this amazing story. If romance is your thing, you might feel a bit cheated because the story focuses on the longing and waiting, or the journey rather than the trophy at the end of the long, dusty trip. Some descriptions read closer to PG-13 than PG so if this is something you'd like a child to read for the rich history lesson make sure you preview it.As for me, I'm going back to pick up Schaub's \\"Finding Anna.\\""},{"Title":"The Longing Season (Music of the Heart #2)","review":"In 1746, Mary Catlett worries about her beloved John Newton, son of a merchant ship captain, who abruptly stopped writing her. She checks the papers for any news about the HMS Harwich, the ship he sails on, as part of the naval war with Spain, but finds nothing, which she knows no news is good news and thanks God for that much.John has left the Navy on a personal quest though his superior officers claim he deserted. He has traveled to Sierra Leone where he was held prisoner while recovering from injuries and across the ocean to Newfoundland with the classics as his guide and a belief that God treats him like a poor Job. On the other hand tossing a Hail Mary she gratefully prays to the Lord that he welcome John in his tent even as she must follow the fate her family has in mind for her unless a miracle occurs.The latest Music of the Heart saga (see FINDING ANNA, the novelization behind \\"It Is Well With My Soul\\") is a terrific telling of Amazing Grace, a great redemption tale as John learns what matters in life is not vengeance but instead faith in the Lord's plan and the love of family. The fabulous story line will please fans of Christian inspirationals as much as second chance historical romance readers. Christine Schaub provides fans with another delightful biographical hymn writer novelization this time of the author of Amazing Grace.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Longing Season (Music of the Heart #2)","review":"\\"The Longing Season\\", by Christine Schaub, is a \\"must read\\", even if you've never heard a hymn. This is the story of John Newton, who wrote the most popular hymn of all time, \\"Amazing Grace\\", and his beloved Mary Catlett Newton. Now before you run screaming from visions of a boring biography, I assure you this is anything but.Christine Schaub has brought John and Mary Newton to life in this captivating novel. Before I read this, I was aware that Newton had been a slave trader, but I had no idea of what a complete reprobate he had been and how little he deserved the fidelity and love of Mary, a courageous woman who was truly ahead of her time. \\"The Longing Season\\" focuses on their courtship period when Newton has gone missing after sailing for Africa; and Mary Catlett who holds onto hope for his return without giving up her own personal life. This has to be one of the great redemption and love stories of all time, and Schaub wove it together so well, I could not put it down even though I knew how it ended.\\"The Longing Season\\" is the second book from the \\"Music of the Heart\\" series. \\"Finding Anna\\", the story of Horatio Gates Spafford who wrote \\"It Is Well With My Soul\\", is the first book and on my list to read next. I am certain it will be just as fascinating as \\"The Longing Season\\"."},{"Title":"The Longing Season (Music of the Heart #2)","review":"If good things come in small packages, then you are in for a real treat with this short but very powerful and poignant story found in Christine Schaub's THE LONGING SEASON -- second book in her \`Music of the Heart' series.As the son of a sea captain in England 1746, there were few options open for a young man than to serve his king during a time of war. Unfortunately the young, brash John Newton served only himself. Going off to sea that journey would see him flogged, turned into a slave, then into a slave trader living a degenerate lifestyle while renouncing all of God's teachings. By some small miracle, word reached him from home and John would start on a new journey with a small \`sliver of hope' that the young woman he'd once lost his heart to would still be waiting there. The journey would be full of pitfalls that would test his faith and bring him to his knees, but through it all Newton would discover the journey to redemption would be one of the most important of his life. Later in life, he would reflect over that journey and go on to write one of the most beloved hymns of all time - \`Amazing Grace'.This was an extraordinary read. The author researched and wrote this with impeccable attention to detail breathing life into the characters that made them even bigger than life. While John Newton led an interesting and incredible life, I was more impressed by the woman he loved. Mary Catlett was a young woman who gave away her heart to a childhood sweetheart, yet when all had given him up for dead remained steadfast in her determination praying for his safe return. Afforded a season in London, courted by a very handsome, very eligible and honorable heir to an Earldom she would turn down a brilliant offer of marriage to remain \`waiting for John'.This author's unique voice, well-written and fast-paced read was a joy making me both laugh and cry. To be sure, as a soloist in my church choir I will have a much greater appreciation while singing one of my personal favorite hymns now knowing of the trials this man's journey of redemption took him on to create such a masterpiece. I loved this book and very highly recommend it.Marilyn Rondeau, RIO - Reviewers International Organization"},{"Title":"The Longing Season (Music of the Heart #2)","review":"Newton stood at the highest point on the neck of land, easily locating Stella Polaris in the rainless, star-studded sky....On the African coast he was successful and powerful. He had his own hut with household servants and two concubines ready to meet his every carnal need. When he returned from one of his regular slave-trading expeditions, he could relax beneath the frankincense tree, fish for bunga in the river, or walk along the beach with his Euclid. No Navy captains harangued him. No religious dogma restrained him.He lived exactly as he pleased.True, it was not the life he had envisioned for so long. It did not include the brilliantly lit shops of Cheapside and the gentlemen's clubs at Pall Mall. It did not include Mary....The Mende practices were far removed from the English and his mother's religion. \\"Diabolical...wretched,\\" she would have called them. Well, then. He supposed he would live and die a wretch among them.Excerpt from: The Longing Season\\"Amazing grace, how sweet the sound, that saved a wretch like me!\\" Who doesn't know the well-loved hymn? Who hasn't hummed the tune, or heard it played at a church service, on a movie, at a funeral? However, what few know is the deep, heart-wrenching story behind the words.Before writing the poem turned hymn, sacred to so many today, John Newton lived a life of debauchery and passed through the teeth of hell, escaping only by God's abounding grace. In The Longing Season, Christine Schaub vividly takes the reader on a tour of England in the 1740's. She most expertly, without bogging one down in detail, draws a mental picture of English life in different social classes.John Newton, wrapped up in the lucrative business of slave trade in the darkest of Africa, continuously spurns the whisperings of the Holy Spirit calling him to turn his life over to God. The only one who ever owned his heart was Mary, pure and innocent. However, to return to Mary means to give up his life of pleasure and sin.Without so much as a word of his whereabouts year after year, Mary Catlett's heart is wooed by another. Viscount Alexander Todd, a loyal friend, was, as society labeled him, \\"her perfect match\\". She had difficulty disagreeing. Yet, as a child, her affections had been given to another, that prodigal son, John Newton.As the years tick by, Mary waits for John to return, and the viscount waits for Mary to stop loving a man who, for all they knew, had been swallowed by the sea. Only God in his sovereignty knows whether or not John's stoney pride can be broken and if Mary's fidelity can withstand the test of time.This is a compelling story of love, the love of a man and a woman being secondary to the great love and utter patience God had with John Newton. This wonderfully true story of redemption combined with Christine's God-given gift for creative writing easily makes The Longing Season a \\"can't put it down\\" kind of book. It is a \\"must read\\" for the lover of hymns, the lover of romance, the lover of history. Unforgettable."},{"Title":"The Longing Season (Music of the Heart #2)","review":"\\"Amazing Grace\\" by John Newton has long been my favorite hymn, and with the recent film release of the same name (focusing on William Wilberforce and his efforts to abolish the slave trade in Britain), I was eager to learn more about the man behind the lyric. The words of that timeless song can tug at the heartstrings like few others. I'd always heard that Newton's dramatic conversion to Christianity and subsequent renunciation of slavery occurred while captaining a slave ship caught in a violent storm. It turns out that truth does not quite match the legend attributed to his life. However, after reading The Longing Season, I would posit that the actuality of Newton's life, though it may lack the \\"light bulb\\" moment and some of the drama of the legend, is an altogether more satisfying, stirring, and powerful portrait of the grace and transformative power of God at work in one man's life.The Longing Season is both a redemption story and an exquisitely told love story. The novel is framed by two sections where an older Newton reminisces about his early life, rebellious youth, and the events that shaped his character. Author Christine Schaub paints a powerful portrait of the experiences and choices that brought Newton to the point that he could write the words to \\"Amazing Grace\\" and know with every fiber of his being that those words represented the truth of his life. The narrative seamlessly alternates between Newton's experiences and those of Mary Catlett, the woman who would eventually become his wife. John and Mary conducted a correspondence-driven, clandestine courtship that transcended distance, separation, and years of anxious uncertainty. As Newton reflects at one point in the novel, Mary was a living, breathing expression of God's grace in his life.For most of the novel, Newton is quite unlikable, even replusive in his callous worldview. But I think any dislike has more to do with the fact that if you're brutally honest with yourself when reading Newton's story, you'll be able to admit to relating to the \\"pre-saved\\" Newton in some way -- if not in action, than in thought. The Longing Season does not look at life through rose-colored glasses -- it's at times painfully honest, but always heart-wrenchingly real in its portrayal of man's sinful nature and the power of Christ's redemptive work. Christine Schaub writes with the pen of a master wordsmith, and her skill and deft touch imbues the novel with a literary, almost lyrical quality. It's a story worth savoring that will stay with you long after you finish the final pages. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Longing Season (Music of the Heart #2)","review":"\\"This book encompasses a wide range of subjects and emotions: romance, adventure, history, spirituality & unbelieveable faith & conflict. The story is so captivating I found it nearly impossible to take even a small break from reading. The author succeeds beautifully in creating characters that are interesting & believeable. The comprehensive descriptive narrative and smooth writing style are a rare find these days. The story gives the reader insight into the life of John Newton, who wrote the beloved hymn \\"Amazing Grace.\\" His journeys from 18th century England to being a slave trader in Africa are quite enthralling. The period style of writing meshes perfectly with the subject matter. Her previous book, \\"Finding Anna\\" was also remarkable and even though I wouldn't have believed it possible, this newest endeavor surpasses her first book. I believe any lover of hymns and even those who may not be very familiar with them will find both Ms. Schaub's novels extremely interesting. A worthy & highly recommended read. I look forward to her future novels, which will complete the \\"Music of the Heart\\" series. I hope & pray eventually one or all of her books will be made into films as this would most certainly interest fans of such productions as \\"Pride & Prejudice.\\""},{"Title":"The Longing Season (Music of the Heart #2)","review":"The Longing Season re-tells Newton's difficult and often harrowing journey of redemption. The book offers perspective on God's sovereignty, but it doesn't attempt to \\"preach.\\" Schaub's descriptions of all the characters, whether actual or fictional, and their interaction with each other, come to life in brilliant word pictures that cause the reader to want to keep reading. It is a compelling story, made even more interesting by the imagination and creativity of the author."},{"Title":"The Longing Season (Music of the Heart #2)","review":"A quick read. I did not find it as riveting as Schaub's first novel, 'Finding Anna'. Perhaps there just wasn't enough material to more fully develop the various characters. Still, if you enjoyed reading her first in the Music of the Heart series, do read 'The Longing Season'. I like to read other novels that a particular author are written in order to get a sense of the writer's style and interests."},{"Title":"The Longing Season (Music of the Heart #2)","review":"Like a reviewer before me, this, too, is my favorite hymn. And Schaub does an outstanding job of telling the story of John Newton, the man who penned the lyrics that were born of his own realization of just how amazing is God's grace."},{"Title":"The Longing Season (Music of the Heart #2)","review":"Amazing Grace is one of my favorite all time hymns. Almost everyone knows this tune whether you are a Christian or not. My favorite version is when it is played by bagpipes. I think I had once heard an Adventures in Odyssey episode that described the story of John Newton (as they did with Horatio Spafford's song). So when I started reading this book about how the inspiration for this song was written I was intrigued. The book was chock full of historical information which I love. The characters are multi dimensional and Mary is a strong character, helping out with the doctor which was uncommon during that time period. Newton's story is harsh as with anything about slavery usually is. I especially found the scene where he I find it interesting that the couple's relationship prior to Newton's leaving was brief and chaste, yet there is a very deep relationship between the two. I really liked the flashback scenes that showed how they first met. The only thing I didn't like was that, even though I knew it was going to happen, was that just when Mary was finally ready to move on, John comes back. I was a bit miffed because Alex was so good to her and was there when she needed someone, while instead she pines away for someone she hasn't seen in years. And then the long lost guy ends up winning, while nice guy is left all alone. Other than that I really enjoyed reading this book. I was surprised to learn that Newton didn't write the last line the song. Ironically I usually only remember the first and last verses when I sing this song.This book is a great prologue to the movie Amazing Grace (starring Ioan Gruffudd and Albert Finney as John Newton) that is coming out in a few weeks. In fact when I first heard about the movie, I immediately thought about this book. While the movie focuses more on William Wilberforce's character, this book is a prequel to get you into the mood for the movie. I definitely enjoyed reading this book and am looking forward to going back to read her first novel, Finding Anna which focuses on another of my favorite hymns."},{"Title":"The Longing Season (Music of the Heart #2)","review":"I read \\"The Longing Season\\" and was somewhat disappointed. It was interesting to read about John Newton's life, but the biggest problem I had was..it was boring. I'd always heard how exciting his life was, but \\"The Longing Season\\" had me longing for some action. The biggest problem was the romance...or lack of. The central plot of the story is the intense love between John Newton and Mary Catlett, with the possibility of romance between Catlett and Viscount Alexander Todd.The problem with all that was Schaub did a very poor job establishing the \\"intense love\\" between Catlett and Newton. It was all based on a few letters and very brief flashbacks, but a series of detailed flashbacks fleshing out that childhood romance would have made me a believer.The book isn't without merit. Schaub does a great job with the setting and her dialog is excellent. I learned a few things as well. If Schaub had put as much effort into creating a \\"real\\" romance between Catlett and Newton as she did alluding to the possibility of a romance between Catlett and Todd, the story would have been much better."},{"Title":"This Was Radio","review":"As a teacher I am always in hot pursuit of books that can help add to a unit or to my personal library. This book tackles both! Full of wonderful photographs from the early days of radio, Lackman's book is a historical account of the glory days of Old Time Radio. The book also contains two narrated cds with excerpts from many comedy shows, drama, mystery and news broadcasts. Those are very helpful in introducing old time radio to my students. If there was ever a book with visual and audio recollections, this is the one to buy!"},{"Title":"This Was Radio","review":"This has to be one of the best books on old radio I've ever seen. The collection of rare photographs was amazing and the audio selection was fantastic."},{"Title":"This Was Radio","review":"In the past, I have reviewed many a set of old-time radio show sets from Radio Spirits but only one or two books about that subject. I noticed in the Radio Spirits catalogue a book called \\"This Was Radio,\\" became interested, got a copy, and was favorably impressed enough to want to tell you about it.Measuring about 14 1/4\\" long and 11 1/4\\" high, this attractive volume of only 57 pages (plus an index) gives a very nice introduction to what radio was all about in the pre-television days and provides plenty of pictures to let you know what the stars looked like. Now the important word is \\"introduction.\\" I must make it clear that you will have to turn to other books for fuller details; but author Ronald Lackmann does what he set out to do very well. He gives you an outline, not a full history, of that phenomenon that was part of so many lives in my generation.The contents are divided like this. Chapter 1: The Beginning, 2: Mystery, adventure, horror, suspense, westerns, 3: Comedy, 4: Music programs, 5: Popular children's programming, 6: Daytime programming for the ladies, 7: Panel, quiz and talk shows, 8: Radio news brings World War II home, 9: Unforgettable radio moments, 10: The golden age of radio lives on.Just as important are the two CDs that accompany the text, letting you hear the actual sounds of many of the programs mentioned in the text and many important moments from our history such as the Hindenburg disaster and Churchill's \\"Finest Hour\\" speech. Among the less important but still memorable selections are the sketch that got Mae West banned from radio and the voices of Marilyn Monroe and Marlin Brando.But I must register a strong reprimand to whoever gave the first CD only two tracks and the second one only four. So while the book gives a complete list of the selections on the discs, you would have a very hard time locating any given one of them-which makes their classroom value nearly nil. Perhaps this can be remedied (although I doubt it) and replacement CDs sent to purchasers.Nevertheless, the discs are fine if you play them straight through; and the text and pictures are well worth the price."},{"Title":"This Was Radio","review":"I was very happy with my purchase on Amazon.com. The price was right and the delivery was in a timely fashion. The book was in great condition as listed in ad. I will check Amazon in the future for other purchases."},{"Title":"This Was Radio","review":"This is a beautiful coffee table book on the Radio's Golden Age. The book provides a comprehensive historical overview of commercial radio from its infancy to the 1960s, when the radio was replaced by the television as the family's entertainment center.&quot;This Was Radio&quot; presents the history of Radio from the beginning with Marconi's production of the wireless telegraph sound system in 1895. The author reviews radio programming in the 1920's and the establishment of the great radio networks - the National Broadcasting Company (NBC), the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) and the Mutual Broadcasting System (MBS).The book includes a detail discussion of the variety of programs offered during the Golden Age of Radio (early 1930 until 1960). Specific chapters detail the radio personalities and their mysteries, adventure, horror, suspense, westerns, comedy, music, children's programs, daytime serials, panel, quiz and talk shows. The author also discusses the importance of radio during World War II and several unforgettable radio moments.The book comes with two compact discs that include excerpts such as Fibber McGee's Closet, Jack Benny's violin; Baby Snooks (Fanny Brice) takes a piano lesson from Daddy (Hanley Stafford); famous sign-offs and much, much more. You can hear the famous voices, the inventors, the network founders, the shows and the events that made up the Golden Years of Radio.The author, Ronald Lackmann, has written thirty-four books on various aspects of the entertainment industry, including &quot;Remember Radio&quot; and &quot;Encyclopedia of American Radio.&quot; He is a former actor who worked on the radio in the 1950's and was the voice of several animated cartoon characters. Mr. Lackmann was also a secondary school and college Speech, Drama and English teacher. He was the host of \\"Education in Action\\".I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in the history of radio and information on the personalities and programs that comprised Radio's Golden Age!"},{"Title":"FE-EIT PM - General Engineering (REA) - The Best Test Prep for the EIT Exam (Engineering (FE/EiT) Test Preparation)","review":"An easy to read test preparation guide, which helps you to refresh fundamental concepts quickly.Out of the 13 chapters of this book, there are 116 problems and solutions( arranged under 10 chapter headings).

The reviews are decently written, but in many cases were incomplete in refreshing things that were prerequisite. Places where my recollection of a subject was poor I had to dig up the AM text, which is much more thorough.What I particularly liked about the review sections was their independence: I felt quite normal skipping around things that I more or less remembered, in both the AM and PM books.The bad: the problems are usually tough to follow, and the reviews assume you have (or had and can quickly recover) a thorough knowledge of the subject.Overall I was happy enough with the texts, especially given their price compared to others of the same kind.

Though I don't disagree, I still think Cass Timberlane is worth reading. It serves as an interesting contrast to the earlier novels. Lewis still has his acrid and acerbic view of American life - he skewers Minnesota and New York City with equal ease. However, he seems to see, at the end of his career, that there is some redemptive moment in life. True, you might find this rather sentimental, but I see it as a synthesis of his earlier Menckenism with the later romance of the swing era. Indeed, this book has many elements of the twenties, but they are tempered by the forties. Having just read Wolfe's Of Time and the River, I noticed that Wolfe was apparently influenced by Lewis. Even as Wolfe surpassed Lewis in achievement, he also brought his novels to a resolution that left an impression of hope and survival."},{"Title":"THE CREEPERS","review":"The story brought me back to some good old entertainment.

I've now gone through several books on topology, and I find that even many of the undergraduate texts tend to be a bit \\"dense,\\" in that they introduce too much, too fast. Croom's textbook takes a very step-by-step, hand-holding approach to introducing topology, focusing on concrete examples, yet still having a reasonable amount of rigor. (Of nine chapters, he doesn't even formally get to topology until Chapter 4. The first three chapters are a general intro, open and closed sets, and metric spaces.) The last chapter offers a basic introduction to algebraic topology. This is an excellent book for self-study, and also good for undergraduates with a physics or engineering orientation who want to get the intuitive principles, and also some sense for the formal math. Students (including undergrads) who are really strong on abstract math might benefit from the more intensive and detailed treatments found in other texts; but even they might find Croom's book useful to fall back on when they get stuck on some basic concept. Croom includes historical discussions of the foundations of topology, which is also helpful. He also includes a glossary of mathematical symbols up front, which is very helpful for trying to keep track of all the new notations involved. There are lots of solved problems, and also problems for students to work out, although solutions for those would be helpful in some future edition."},{"Title":"Principles of Topology (Saunders series)","review":"I taught a one semester course on basic point set topology out of this book. The emphasis in the first half is on metric spaces, which provide the most natural class of examples for the basic principles of point set topology that any student taking a course in topology must know about. There is little extraneous material, and I found that the students thought the book was very good. This was a group of students at a regional campus of a large state university, and I would recommend the book for a beginning course at a comparable campus. Those teaching at research institutions will want more."},{"Title":"Principles of Topology (Saunders series)","review":"I was very disappointed to see that this text is out of print.

And in Wichita, Kansas, a police detective on temporary leave is asked to see if he can track her down. Out of this material James Girard builds a complex and chilling suspense story. One full of haunting characters whose interactions reflect the confused and often heartless state of the human mind.Floyd Lassiter is a police detective who is becoming increasingly subject to temporal lobe seizures. Because of a recent episode involving an assistant district attorney, he has been temporarily relieved of duty. While he has kept his problem a secret, Floyd knows that it is only a matter of time before he will no longer be able to operate as a police officer, no longer be able to do what he loves. Thus, he is relieved when Loomis, his chief, calls him in to talk about Celeste. She is believed to have returned to the Wichita area and the police have been asked to help with the case. With no on duty investigator available, Lassiter is recruited for the task.Lassiter's investigation uncovers layer after layer of subterfuge. Thin clues lead him back though records and memories to a young prostitute, one who changes identities as needed. But Celeste and Lassiter are not the only actors in this drama. Jes Wellington, a professional writer, Zach Vincent, a computer consultant, and Jerry Majors, Floyd's partner all play major parts in this tale along with many others. Even as bits of the truth are gradually surface, other mysteries are uncovered. Gradually the book evolves from pure detection to thriller.This is a noir tale, where all of the characters are exposed to events that will either change or destroy them. Lassiter's worst enemy is his own mind. His mental state unravels and fragments as the story progresses. Girard reflects this not just in his portrayal of the detective, but in the very style of the novel itself. The book is a continuous flow of points of view, as narration switches from one character to another, almost at random. The author is capable of gemlike moments of narrative and characterization, but never allows a sense of continuity to develop. As such, the reader often feels imprisoned in Lassiter's mental state - suffering from the same syndrome.To be honest, I found this wearing. As the book moves along, it becomes clear that there is no central character. This device kept me from becoming as involved as I would like to have been, and left me trying to juggle too many facts and subplots. If one does not have the time and energy to remain focused on the story it is very easy to lose the thread from reading to reading. This is a matter of personal taste and won't bother everyone equally. Girard deserves credit for writing a story in exactly the style I like least and still managing to keep my attention as well as he did. While I found it slow going, others will enjoy the many polished facets of the telling.&lt;"},{"Title":"Some Survive","review":"Prolog: Young Lady with father in room chatting.

The characters are sharp against the landscape, and the setting is unusual and intriguing. I recommend this book: it's well written and suspenseful. Perfect for a quiet evening by a fire!"},{"Title":"Journey into Terror","review":"Journey Into Terror by Anne K. Edwards is a gripping novel of murder, revenge, and harrowing escape. Set on a small island, Julia Graye is a woman accused of a murder she did not commit, and must elude the homicidal hatred of the victim's closest friends, even as she must find a way to prove the identity of the real killer. A deadly saga of deceit, blood, kidnaping, and the desperate struggle to survive, Journey Into Terror is especially recommended reading for mystery/suspense enthusiasts."},{"Title":"Journey into Terror","review":"Julia Graye goes to the tropical island of Tiboo to attend the wedding of Samantha, an old college friend, but she soon discovers that all is not well in Paradise. On the trip to the island, the boat's captain warns her that there's political trouble afoot on the island, and when she arrives, she finds dissention shadowing her friend's family. The natives treat Julia with cool hostility and even some of Samantha's relatives appear less than thrilled to see her. Warnings and threats come from all around her. A series of increasingly unnerving events follow, culminating in Julia's discover of the body of Samantha's murdered fiance. Julia soon learns that the victim was deeply involved in smuggling and the volatile political situation. Her concern for her friend will pull her into the tangled plots surrounding them and put her life in jeopardy. Fans of the old-fashioned Gothic novels of the 1960s and 70s will find Journey Into Terror a modern version of the genre, with all the typical elements including not one, but two, large threatening houses, hostile servanta, cryptic warnings, mysterious events, escalating danger and a compellingly attractive but possible dangerous stranger who is clearly deeply involved in some shadowy plots. After a slow start, the pace picks up rapidly and the last third of the book is a nonstop series of pulse-raising suspenseful escapades that lead to an exciting conclusion. Reviewed by Karen McCullough of Scribes World"},{"Title":"Journey into Terror","review":"After receiving an unexpected wedding invitation from an old college girlfriend, aspiring novelist Julia Graye flies to the exotic Mantuan Islands to attend the celebration. Not having seen nor heard from her friend Samantha for the last six years, Julia finds the request somewhat odd. Yet she's soon captivated by the idea of visiting this part of the world which she's heard so much about. Maybe the place will even inspire her and give her an idea for a novel.However, as soon as she steps foot in Orinda, the capital, an atmosphere of mystery and dread begins to darken her enthusiasm. On the boat ride to Tiboo, the little volcanic island where Samantha actually lives and where Julia will be staying for the next few days, the Captain warns her about bad times and political restlessness and advises her to turn back. Turn back, after such a long trip? She's just got here. She'll only be here a few days to attend a friend's wedding. What possible harm could come to her?That night she finally meets Samantha again, as well as Samantha's petulant brother and cold mother. An air of intrigue, lies and secrets seems to veil this old family. Then the next day, to Julia's utter shock, she discovers a dead body on the beach, a body which turns out to be none other than Samantha's groom-to-be Ramon. The police declare it a murder. Family members and relatives become suspects; everybody appears to be hiding something. Moreover, Julia can't shake off the feeling that she's been followed, that someone's been tracking her movements. But who and why?After several suspicious incidents it becomes clear someone wants Julia dead, but what possible threat could a harmless aspiring novelist pose to anyone? As she's caught in the vortex and forced to fight for her life, her actions will have an impact on the political future of the entire island.This book impelled me to read late into the night. I simply couldn't put it down. Anne K. Edwards has created a twister of deception and mystery that kept me guessing for the culprits. The climax gripped me and left me breathless all the way to the fully satisfying ending. The exotic setting, polished narration, tight plot and strong atmosphere of menace make this story a must read for lovers of the genre. Being a fan of this very talented author, I impatiently look forward to reading more of her works. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Girl in the Shadows : The Shadow Series Book 2","review":"This has to stop, seriously. When Neiderman first ghostwrote for VCA, he did a decent job. I liked the Cutler series, and he did a good job of finishing up the books that VCA had started but didn't finish for the Dollanganger and Casteel series. The Landry and Logan series, while not the best, were still very decent, and I enjoyed them. However, it all started to go downhill with Orphans. That was not what VCA would have written. I endured the Hudson and DeBeers series with disgust. Broken Wings and Gemini were intolerable.April wasn't a real heroine. There were no horrible, dark secrets (her father's secret was laughable) and no real family secrets at all. This book focused a lot her stumbling (and unrealistic) explorations of her own sexuality as well as her struggle with weight. It seems as if the ghostwriter is venting his dislike of fat people because April is obsessed about her weight and everyone else makes fun of her, and in this book the struggle continues and is contrived and predictable in many places. The scene where she was in the bath with the young deaf girl was creepy.It also seems that Neiderman has a problem with deaf characters, as in the Logan series, May was portrayed as weak and fragile and helpless, and the deaf girl in this book is portrayed the same way, in a unfunny and unsympathetic caricature. Disappointing."},{"Title":"Girl in the Shadows : The Shadow Series Book 2","review":"Overall I've enjoyed this \\"Shadows\\" series-the two books are intriguing stories with lots of twists and turns, and an ultimately positive message of an adolescent girl finding self-esteem, strength, and resilience in the wake of successive tragedies. She also learns compassion and there's a lot of sensitivity in the character portraits in the book. I really grew to like April, and the plot was pretty exciting, but some parts of the book were just too repetitive and boring-I had to skip them.And I must renew my original objection to the series, which is that there is no romance in it. That seems to actually be a pattern as of late with the ghostwriter; beginning with Willow, whose only really passionate love interest ends up being callously uninterested in her, I feel the VC Andrews franchise has begun to neglect to provide our heroines with a faithful, utterly devoted lover. What happened to Christopher from \\"Flowers in the Attic\\", Troy from \\"Heaven\\" etc. etc.? VC NEVER had a heroine who didn't have some man who was obsessed with her. April's relationship with Tyler is depressing and unfulfilling both for her and us.The voyeurism Tyler seems to want to experience with Destiny, April's ventriloquist \\"dummy\\", follows with creepy VC tradition, but the plot is not really developed. I just think that if Tyler was going to be that dysfunctional, then a better lover should have shown up at the end. These later books don't have much real passion in them; just a lot of \\"hook-ups\\".This isn't what VC readers want. And as intriguing as April was, and as much as I congratulate the author's willingness to create a character that went against VC \\"type\\" (i.e., chubby and of ambiguous sexual orientation), I just felt the series story could have had more emotional resonance if it had allowed April one more book to truly find herself, resolve her family issues, work out her relationship with Brenda and find meaningful intimacy with someone. Ultimately the book just didn't have the romantic magic outerworldly element that we need from VC books.Still, I recommend it as an entertaining few hours. Just don't expect to be swept away the way you were with early V.C...but then again you probably already knew that."},{"Title":"Girl in the Shadows : The Shadow Series Book 2","review":"April is a chubby sexually confused girl. After her uncle died in book one, she got taken in by a nice elderly woman. April provides company to the woman and her deaf granddaughtar. Just as April begins to enjoy her new life, the deaf girls greedy mom returns wanting money and even hoping her own mother dies. With a aging Grandma, and a deaf daughtar, only April can stand in her way.I really enjoyed this. It's slow paced, but very good. Strong characters started in book one continue and get even better. April is ever battling her weight, and Destiny a doll returns to steal the show. This is similar to a lot of other V.C Andrews books and predictable, but there are surprises too. It has all the nastiness you expect including a sick bathtub scene, and a attempted rape scene that actually has you laughing your head off. That sounds bad but, you have to read it to see. It's not as harsh as some and not many secrets, but we don't need them. Also it has a good ending that doesn't leave you sick and depressed.

Andrews books.Now, don't get me wrong, this is not a clone of My Sweet Audrina, in fact, the storyline is nothing like it. However, I could feel the same stange, haunting, lonely undertones as that long ago V. C. Andrews masterpiece. A young girl surrounded by some strange and sinister people who finds her muster when she most needs it.April's adventure in this book was a little unexpected. I thought there would be more of Brenda, but her absence (until the end of the book) is not noticed. Instead April turns out to be rock of strength of Brenda always hoped she would be and encouraged her to be. In fact, we are left questioning. What is April's sexuality? Does it really matter? I was glad to see Mr. Neiderman was braver in this book and didn't hesitate to use the terms gay and lesbian. It made the book so much real!If you read any of my other V. C. Andrews reviews you will see that I never detail the book chapter by chapter. I just give my general feelings, and they are always good feelings. I am a fan for life. The excitement here is to pick up GIRL IN THE SHADOWS for yourself and find the good stuff for yourself!My hat is off to Mr. Neiderman again. The sneak peek of BROKEN FLOWER is exhilirating. I cannot wait to the read it when it comes out. My only fear is that the days of V.

Having read the Harry Potter books (who hasn't?), I naturally had a preconception that this would be similar, with the teenagers learning and performing spells, etc. And while that is true to a point, I found this book much darker in its tone and the magic is much more serious than most of the things done by Harry & Co. And having said that, I cannot honestly say that this is a book that I will read again as I have the Potter series.

The story of 13 year old girl mixed with another boy is weaved together of them trying to learn magic. Just novices, they are experimenting w/ Speech that leads them to a lot of trouble.

This is a good book for anyone who likes magic. However, readers might not like it if they only like Harry Potter-type magic, because the wizards in this book don't need wands or a school for wizardry.

I happened across \\"So You Want to Be a Wizard\\" and decided to read it. Being a great fan of fantasy, I am very familiar with the typical epic tale that takes thousands of pages to reach its conclusion. This novel has many of those great epic characteristics (references to creation/creator(s), the choosing of ordinary-seeming young people to be saviors of the universe, the battle between good and evil, etc.), yet manages to tell the complete story in less than 400 pages.The novel is about two junior high students, Nita and Kit, and what befalls them when they attempt to use their new-found wizard abilities to locate Nita's stolen pen. In the process they meet a white hole, who they nickname Fred (a white hole being the opposite of a black hole - a black hole absorbs things; a white hole emits things). It turns out that Nita's pen is in an alternate New York City, where cars, elevators, door locks, and other mechanical objects are all self-aware - and vicious. The landmarks and buildings of New York City are very integral to the setting of this novel. Natives of the city would really appreciate this.Despite the inclusion of a universe-threatening battle between good and evil, there is a lot of humor in this book. Fred's difficulties in adapting to the planet earth were particularly amusing. In my opinion this is an excellent fantasy novel. I came to care for the characters very much. Not many novels make me both laugh and cry, but this one did."},{"Title":"So You Want to Be a Wizard: Young Wizard Series, Book 1","review":"So You Want to Be a Wizard (1983) is the first fantasy novel in the Young Wizards series. \\"A Wizard's business is to conserve energy -- to keep it from being wasted...even slow down the death of the Universe\\"In this book, Nita is running from a gang of young female thugs and notices that the local library is still open.

As she is reminiscing about the many books that she has read and re-read, her finger is caught by a book that she has never seen before: So You Want to Be a Wizard. She takes it home with her.After reading the introduction, she decides that it can't hurt to take the Wizard's Oath and she might really become a wizard. Afterwards, she falls asleep and, when she awakes the next day, her name has been added, as a novice, to the list of wizards in her area. She rushes out to a private spot to find out more and to do the beginning exercises involving really seeing patterns, then discovers that the tree that she is sitting beneath is talking to her. It is rather upset at wizards at present, since one had been messing up its beautiful collage of leaves. Nita asks about the other wizard and learns his current location, which is another of her private spots nearby.When she finds the other wizard, Kit, he calmly accepts her explanation of the damage he has done to the leave and needle collages, agrees to correct the problem, and then explains what he has been trying to do without success. As he explains, it occurs to him that the missing factor may be her participation and invites her to join him in the spell.Nita and Kit retire to a bare spot nearby and begin a spell of protection with an additional function for finding a special pen stolen by the young female thugs. When completed, this spell takes them to another New York, darker and inhabited by something terrifying. In their efforts to return to their own world, they pull in a white hole to provide extra power. They call the white hole Fred, since his real name is unpronounceable, and they learn that Fred was looking for an Advisory to report that the Book of Night with Moon is missing. Nita and Kit look up the local Advisories in their manuals and find that the nearest is Crazy Swale, who lives near their school.They decide to get Nita's pen back first and Nita corners Joanne and demands her pen back. This direct approach startles Joanne at first, but then she flourishes the pen in front of Nita and dares her to take it back. Fred neatly whisks the pen away, leaving Joanne totally freaked out for a second, but then Joanne goes into aggressive mode. Fortunately, the first bell rings and Joanne postpones her attack until after school.All is temporarily all right, but then Fred announces that he has swallowed Nita's pen and he gets the hiccups. Not just any hiccups, for the first hiccup emits a color TV and the next emits four encyclopedia volumes. After school, Joanne and her gang are waiting, but Fred lures them away by hiccuping a Learjet. After that, Nita and Fred go directly to Crazy Swale's house. Fred emits a Mercedes-Benz just as they arrive.Tom Swale turns out to be a thirty-ish year old man with a sheepdog that finds things and a macaw who tells the future, particularly of pork bellies. His partner is Carl Romeo. They check their references and are able to cure Fred's hiccups, but Nita and Kit will have go to Manhattan and use the Grand Central worldgate to recover the pen.It is obvious from this book that it about the multiverse at a period that wasn't quite used to the concept. The author doesn't let that slow her down, however, as she blithely discusses more dimensions and universes than a theoretic physicist could come up with in a lifetime. The author just doesn't write small.This novel is a fun read and also funny (I haven't even told you about Kit's dog) as well as being stuffed with unusual ideas. The later books in the series get into more serious concepts, but are still fun reads (Kit's dog just keep getting weirder and more likable). The other members of the Callahan and Rodriguez families get more time on stage and deeper characterization, which is all to the good.Note: The Book of Night with Moon later written by this author has entirely different contents than the one described in this novel.Recommended for Duane fans and anyone who enjoys well-crafted fantasy juveniles with innovative concepts.-Arthur W. Jordin"},{"Title":"So You Want to Be a Wizard: Young Wizard Series, Book 1","review":"this is the one! I have read the entire young wizards series and from the time I read the first book I couldn't help thinking:\\"I hope this series doen't end any time soon, because I just might die when it does\\"The charecters are complex, as well as the story. Through 9 books diane duane doesn't ever even give a plotly reminder of one of the books befor it. They all have their own story, adn in So You Want to be a Wizardthe story is differnt that any other book I have ever read (or just hear of, for that matter). Duane puts a spin on magic as we know it, truly creating a thriller, because no matter how many fanisy books you have read, you will have never found one where magic is executed like this. That fact makes teh book totally un-exspectable. The characters are deep, and you never find your self thinking 'why did he do that, what was he thinking!?' because duane swithces back and forth between 1st person in nitas brain(one of the two main characters) and 1st person in kits brain (the other main character). Fred, although kind of cutes, and seemingly poitless, acually turs out to be an important element in the story. (yet another un-exspected twist). The series is a stange mix of fantacy and science fiction. Although I don't like science fiction, that fatistical element makes it so weird I love it! Each book has its own unique story, and changes the lives of our young wizards forever. I reconmend this series to lovers of fantacy, science fiction, and real life novels, because the young wizards series a twisted mix of all three. I can't really find adaquit words to exsplain it.TRULY WONDERFUL, THRU AND THRU!"},{"Title":"So You Want to Be a Wizard: Young Wizard Series, Book 1","review":"So You Want to Be a Wizard puts a spin on the average person's idea of 'magic', combining the forces of nature with unreal powers. The amazing descriptions and original characters makes this book seem like a new adventure, though it's quite old. I love the author's style and the deepness of the story, and the way the characters slowly develop thoughout the book.This book isn't for young children, though. If you're considering buying SYWTBAW with the hopes of a story somewhat like Harry Potter, you probably shouldn't - the story is heavy, and the style of the Speech is much unlike Harry's waving around his magical wand.Overall, a very good book. I reccommend it to anyone who wants a good, intriguing story to last them a few days."},{"Title":"So You Want to Be a Wizard: Young Wizard Series, Book 1","review":"I'm ten years old, and so far this book and its sequels (Deep Wizardry, High Wizardry, etc.)are among the best fantasy books I've ever read (I've read a lot of books). The magic in them is much more complex than it is in the Harry Potter books. It's not just a wave of your wand and some Latin words; it's geometric shapes and strange words in Speech (the wizarding language) written in the sand, wizard's knots and paragraphs to say in Speech. I also like the idea of a manual that teaches Nita and Kit (the main characters) wizardry, instead of a teacher. The characters also seem more real than they do in some other fantasy books (at least the human ones do). This is a great series!"},{"Title":"So You Want to Be a Wizard: Young Wizard Series, Book 1","review":"I found this to be one of the most wonderful books I have ever read. Diane Duane's sense of magic is so detailed in some areas that it's hard not to believe it's real. The characters are lovable heroes. My friend recommended this to me and together we read the entire series and the corresponding one about the cats. (She also wrote to books geared more for adults about wizard cats in the same world- also excellent)Duane gives magic a chance in the real world- why and how it would work, and why the rest of the world doesn't know about it. In later novels she goes on to create a vast world for her characters that, for all we know, could be real!"},{"Title":"So You Want to Be a Wizard: Young Wizard Series, Book 1","review":"This is a very good book that deals with problems a lot of kids have, such as being picked on and left out, even if the main focus was fantasy. Being an avid reader of fantasy, I have read all the old cleshaes, but this book was in a league all it's own. The story is about thirteen year old Nita, who goes into a library to hide from bullies, and comes across a training book on how to be a wizard. After reading through it, she discovers that she has many of the qualifications, so she decides to give it a shot, though she suspects some sort of prank. In her exploriations, she meets up with Kit, a twelve year old boy in basicly the same situation as her, and they decide to team up and be partner wizards. As I read this book, I found myself likeing it more and more, as I enjoyed the sense of magic, and identified strongly with the main character. Though some of the magic spells they were doing got a little bit tedious, the book was generaly very exiting and well written with somewhat of a sad ending."},{"Title":"So You Want to Be a Wizard: Young Wizard Series, Book 1","review":"this is a great book to read with any young person in your life....It truly opens up the imagination.....My husband and i enjoyed it 9 years ago and now we can share it with our son...

It has an amazing story line that only some authors can come up with. I really enjoyed the magical methods of carrying out their tasks. When I read a fantasy book, I really want it to take me away into another place and reality and this book acomplished that well. I thought that the creativity of the creatures and entropy were so clever, with all of the carnivorous cars and the dragon in the subway. The setting on New York City really put and interesting twist on the plot that left me thinking, maybe in all of those deep dark places, maybe there really are dragons and wizards saving the planet and the universe every day. I read a lot of fantasy books and this book along with all of the other three in the wizardry series are definitely going on my favorites list. I highly suggest reading this book and it's three companions."},{"Title":"So You Want to Be a Wizard: Young Wizard Series, Book 1","review":"I have read almost every fantasy and sci-fi book that I can find and this was one of the best.

Nita, a hispanic boy named Kit, and a white hole named Fred that they picked up try to open a world gate to get Nita's pen back and have their plans go horribly wrong. Flung into a different dimension for fiddling with the world gate they have to battle the Lone Power and his oddly deranged machines to escape.

The Great HP is a loveable character and the plots are great. To be perfectly honesty I liked this one better than the HP books. Why? Because Nita and Kit are expected to be more responsible for their actions then young HP.All in all I definitely have to say that thus far if you like HP you'll like this series as well.

There were parts of the story that were nicely done, but the book was not a joy to read as are the Harry Potter books, and not as easily read as the Madeleine L'engle books.

She is tired of being chased and of being beaten up, and she is especially tired of having to explain to her family why she doesn't fight back. When she stumbles acros a book called \\"So You Want to be a Wizard\\" in her public library, Nita is intrigued. She doesn't quite believe in wizardry, but she checks out the book and decides to give it a try. She will do anything to keep the bully from hurting her again, even cast a spell.Surprisingly enough, the book seems real. Soon after she discovers it, Nita meets Kit, a boy about her age with some of the same problems. He's had a book on wizardry for awhile and she teams up with him to cast a spell to get their tormenters to leave them alone. But in the midst of the spell, something happens and a new creature appears in Kit and Nita's world.Now Kit and Nita are trapped in a situation that seems to be way over their heads. They must stick together and work with each other to set things right again. Will they, two novice wizards, be able to fight against a dark power?I liked Kit and Nita and the way they used their intelligence to get themselves out of bad situations. I also liked Nita's family, and I liked the way the world of magic was developed in this story. However, some parts of this book were pretty draggy; there was a lot of description I wasn't very interested in reading and that weighed the book down."},{"Title":"So You Want to Be a Wizard: Young Wizard Series, Book 1","review":"One of the fantasies that many children have is to have some kind of power. This fantasy is particularly strong when children are in elementary school and they so often feel powerless or helpless. Juanita (Nita) Callahan and Christopher (Kit) Rodriguez fall into this category. Kit has been advanced a couple of grades in school, so he is teased for his intelligence and his size. Juanita tends to speak her mind, which frequently gets her in trouble with the supposedly cool crowd.Juanita is in the library one day, hiding out from the ever-present bullies, when she runs across a book titled \\"So You Want to Be a Wizard.\\" At first Nita wonders whether the book is some sort of joke, or fictional. After she reads the Wizard's Oath, she soon discovers that the book is remarkable in how it keeps itself up-to-date as information about the world and the skill level of its reader changes. Nita also discovers that she has become a wizard.Nita soon meets Kit and discovers that she is not the only wizard in the world. One of the first requirements of being a wizard is to go on an Ordeal, which has a level of difficulty that that matches the power of the wizards involved. Nita and Kit are quite powerful and they go up against the Lone One in a world he made to prevent the Lone One from unmaking the entire universe. In the course of trying to keep the level of entropy in the universe at the lowest level possible, and keeping the Lone One from unmaking the universe, Kit and Nita find themselves in situations where they risk death. At one point in the book it is only through the sacrifice of two remarkable beings that Kit and Nita survive their sojourn into the Lone One's world.While Diane Duane wrote this story about children in elementary school, I feel that it is a very mature story in many ways. This story does have a number of intense moments and may be unsuitable for some children under the age of 8 or 9. Additionally, Diane's vocabulary may present an additional hurdle for some ages. However, the story does not treat children as persons to be protected by adults, and the children find that they do have power to affect their world. One balance Diane brought into the book is an extremely strong code of ethics. Wizards must behave very morally or bad things can happen to them.This book is a worthy introduction to the Young Wizards series and an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"So You Want to Be a Wizard: Young Wizard Series, Book 1","review":"So far the first one was the absolute best!

However, when visiting friends in Toronto, 'So, you Wanna be a Wizard?' caught my eye at a small bookstore on King St. near the time of the Jazz Fest. Well, what first caught my eye was the beautiful cover illustration. Secondly -and this was the last and first straw of any force that might've kept me from buying this book- I noticed the author, in bold print; Diane Duanne. Finally, I noticed the title. Without further observation or reluctance, I took the book under wing and left Toronto the next day.'So, you Wanna be a Wizard?' (more due to its beauty than its size or DEFINITELY structure) took me twenty-three hours -with the regular day's interruptions that would be expected added on to this timing- to complete. I refused to sleep until I reached the ending, which is satisfying, but harbors a need to buy the next sequel. What a beautiful combination, eh?My recommendation?1. Buy this book.2.

Panicked by this avatar in their midst, publishers who had not been as far-sighted as Scholastic suddenly began combing through their backlists in an attempt to find something ANYTHING that they could rerelease and leech off some of that residual Harry Potter energy. Puffin Books dusted off Eve Ibbotson's, \\"The Secret of Platform 13\\" and \\"Which Witch?\\" while Harcourt remembered Diane Duane. Duane wrote the first book of her Young Wizards series waaaay way back in 1983. I was five. Since then she's been steadily churning out each subsequent volume with a slow but sure hand. I'd heard a fair amount about \\"So You Want to Be a Wizard?\\" but had never found the time to pick up the book myself. In doing so I discovered references to some of the best books in children's fantasy but also enough originality to allow the series to stand on its own two feet. The great shame of \\"So You Want to Be a Wizard\\" is that it will now be remembered as a Harry Potter rip-off simply because it remains a bit obscure and people don't realize which came first. Librarians and kids who can do away with that impression will be doing the world quite a bit of good.Nita's having a fairly typical day of dodging the neighborhood bullies when she stops in her local library. Though she hasn't been in the basement children's room in a while, she takes a turn down below and happens across a most extraordinary title. An entry in the \\"So You Want to Be a\\" books, the edition Nita finds is called, \\"So You Want to Be a Wizard?\\". Nita, as it happens, does want to be one. At least, she wants to be one when she considers how difficult it is to deal with the neighborhood's nasty bullies. After taking the book's oath she joins up with fellow newbie wizard Kit and the two discover they've a range of different abilities. Nita can hear the speech of living things (everything from trees to dogs) while Kit can talk to cars and stones and other inanimates. After accidentally befriending a small white hole (like a black hole, but cuter) the odd threesome find themselves trapped in an alternate New York City. There's only one way of escaping and it means fighting the most powerful evil being in the entire universe. So much for the odd bully, eh?Like Madeline L'Engle before her, Duane is intrigued with the notion of crossing her fantasy elements with a little science. Therefore, we learn all kinds of interesting factoids about the elemental spheres and the nature of the universe and heavenly bodies. Duane's influences don't stop there, though. While juggling L'Engle on the one hand, she's also tossing about a little Ursula Le Guin on the other. Like the \\"Earthsea\\" books, Duane uses the idea of speech as power. The kids in this book are powerful insofar as they are able to learn the speech that connects all living (and sometimes not living) things. Of course, in \\"The Wizard of Earthsea\\", this kind of magic is very difficult to learn and takes quite a bit of time. \\"So You Want To Be a Wizard\\" simplifies this idea and has the kids in it proficient at a very early stage. It also makes some odd references to the fact that younger wizards can be more powerful than older wizards. It's an idea that's almost too convenient to be entirely believable. Finally, the notion that wizards must fight against a kind of ultimate Unmaker reeks of Orson Scott Card's, \\"Alvin Maker\\" series.On the whole, Duane does a nice job tying in a fantastical otherworld version of Manhattan Island in this book. If Harry Potter can jaunt around a magical London, why not get an American version on our shores? Pulling out wild ideas that cover everything from living subway trains to protective trees in Central Park, Duane is consistently original. Interestingly enough, the character of Fred (the displaced white hole) is so similar to the character of Calcifer in \\"Howl's Moving Castle\\" that I half wonder if Diana Wynne Jones wasn't sneaking a peek at \\"So You Want to Be a Wizard\\" on the sly.Sometimes the story is a little odd, of course. Unlike every other wizardry book for children in the world, no one is teaching Kit and Nita any of these spells. They don't go to a special school or have private tutors and the like. Everything they've learned has been self-taught through their books. At the end of the story, I expected some kindly old grand wizard to appear out of nowhere and congratulate the kids on a job well-done. No such luck. In this world, wizardry is a thankless job with small but plausible benefits. The two adult wizards that the kids encounter (who struck me as perhaps the first same-sex couple to have ever graced the pages of a children's fantasy novel) are perfectly nice but also perfectly unavailable when danger strikes. The kids work in a kind of vacuum and as such they must rely only on one another. It kind of ups the ante when you know there's not gonna be a Gandalf, Merlin, or Dumbledore bursting through the door when the going gets tough.Speaking of Dumbledore, it's very amusing to read about the villain in this book. He's a being so terrible that to repeat his name is to give him power. Therefore he goes through much of this title with people whispering about You Know Who. The book also talks about death like it's a bad thing and unnatural to the world. Contrast that notion with J.K. Rowling's fight against not calling a villain by his real name (Dumbledore, if you'll recall, doesn't approve) and the fact that Voldemort is obsessed with fighting AGAINST death... well unfortunately the Harry Potter books come off looking a lot better. Sorry, Ms. Duane.All in all, \\"So You Want to Be a Wizard\\" makes for splendid American fantasy reading. It's not as witty as \\"The Wee Free Men\\" by Terry Pratchett or as complex as your average Diana Wynne Jones, but Duane has fashioned a perfectly nice story in and of itself. I am more than pleased to see that it has burst from its 1983 shell to become a true classic. And for those kids happy enough to read it, there are plenty more where this first book came from. Worth checking out."},{"Title":"So You Want to Be a Wizard: Young Wizard Series, Book 1","review":"Nita Callahan and Kit Rodriguez used to be ordinary people, until they found the book called, So You Want To Be A Wizard.

I HOPE THIS HELPED A LOT!!!!!"},{"Title":"So You Want to Be a Wizard: Young Wizard Series, Book 1","review":"Diane Duane wrote the 370 pages of So You Want to Be a Wizard, for anyone who is or ever was a little bit different. Nita is a bright, curious girl whose choices are delightful to follow. Could you believe in a world where trees have feelings and time stands still so you can get something done? Duane even makes walking on air seem believable. Through doing something new and extraordinary, Nita finds her best friend.As Nita finishes running away from her rivals, she runs her hand along the library bookshelf and finds her own So You Want to Be a Wizard. The book that will change her life seems to know a little too much about her. Duanbe uses foreshadowing well here because it is almost as if wizardry is he calling. Everyone has felt called to do something like Nita, only not as unbelievable.&quot;She opened the book at random And on the page to which she opened, there was the Oath.&quot; Everyone has difficult decisions on what they are going to commit to and sign up for. Nita makes an important decision to take the Oath, only she doesn't realize how important giving her word will become. Taking an Oath or making a promise is giving your word and how you follow through determines how much your word is worth. Duane seems to be teaching this hidden theme throughout the story.While trying to solve her problems she meets Kit with problems of his own. Duane does a good job of enforcing themes throughout the story. Just like in real life, the two new friends help each other. They begin a process and fight that everyone faces; fighting evil with good. The quest becomes not only dangerous but a worth-while thrill. Battling angry helicopters and running from taxis becomes not so had to believe as Duane describes characteristics. Looking to their elders for advice, Nita and Kit grow and learn while the reader looks on in admiration.Cars being evil, spells solving problems, and magic portholes were nothing but figures of speech before this. Duane makes it believable and has it all figured out with every angle covered, any &quot;but what if,&quot; is answered. As the stories plot thickend and the climax arises, anticipation of what is to become of the new wizard keeps the book open and the pages turning.Overall, talking to a car with its own mind and magic wands are known fragments of the imagination that come to life in the book. Friendship, role models, dangers, and battles are seen in everyday life. Duane takes everyday values and shows them through the concept of wizardry. Therefore, the book is not only useful but engaging as well. This book will leave everyone as Nita felt, &quot;She shut the book and stood there holding it in her hand, confused, amazed, suspicious--and delighted.&quot;"},{"Title":"So You Want to Be a Wizard: Young Wizard Series, Book 1","review":"I think it is very funny. A lot of the characters said things that were funny. I only read one book that gave me nightmares this one didn't. The more the main characters tried to get out of trouble the more they get in it.

As she skims through it quickly, as it is getting late, she discovers her name listed as one of the potential wizards, so she checks out the book and brings it home?

It arrived promptly, in good shape, and made a nice gift. It's appropriate for children 8 or 9 on up."},{"Title":"So You Want to Be a Wizard: Young Wizard Series, Book 1","review":"&quot;So You Want To Be A Wizard&quot; is the beginning of an exciting and tantalizing series where wizardry and life in the city are a little too close for comfort. Nita, an intelligent but physically unendowed 13-year-old, finds refuge in the kid's section of the library after a particularly bad beating by a group of school bullies - and finds a book that not only tells her that there *is* magic but how to get it, why to get it, and how to use it.Kit, a 12-year-old Hispanic boy with school troubles similar to hers, teams up with her in a wizardly Ordeal to gain their powers. Shifted &quot;sideways&quot; into an alternate Manhattan, they discover both their wizardly talents and find friends in each other.I originally read first High Wizardry (the last books in the series), then Deep Wizardry (the second book) and then this, before going on to A Wizard Abroad. I also enjoyed her Feline Wizards series, of which only two books are in print so far. However, other YA readers may not: they are on an adult reading level and you need to appreciate this.I also recommend other books (most of these are fantasy) by Patricia Wrede (her Dragons series, &quot;Dealing with Dragons&quot;, &quot;Talking with Dragons&quot;, etc), the Unicorn series by Tamora Pierce (&quot;Black Unicorn&quot;, &quot;Red Unicorn&quot;), the &quot;Hero and the Crown&quot; and &quot;The Blue Sword&quot; by Robin McKinley.All of these books, including (especially!) So You Want To Be A Wizard have strong female protagonists. I am, after all, a 13-year-old girl and really dislike the knight-in-shining-armour- rescues-the-damsel-in-distress stuff.I believe you will really enjoy So You Want to Be A Wizard. Either buy it here or ask for it at a library. Interlibrary Loan works really well!Enjoy!"},{"Title":"So You Want to Be a Wizard: Young Wizard Series, Book 1","review":"Diane Duane, a great science-fiction writer and author of many Star Trek books, writes an original and special tale of magic and wizardry, which seems less like magic than like magical science. Because of the eerie scenery, this may not appeal to some Harry Potter-type readers.Nita is a very ordinary kid who is constantly kicked around by the snobby local bullies. To escape them, she heads for the library, and finds a book called &quot;So You Want To Be a Wizard.&quot; Thinking it's a joke, Nita checks out the book and goes home to read it. Within days, she's and her new friend Kit are both wizards, and off on a genuinely frightening adventure, to where trees tell stories and cars rove like packs of wolves.Perhaps the best character is a tiny white hole nicknamed Fred. The funniest scene in the book is when he gets the hiccups...Manhatten never seemed to be appealing until I read this book, where it hides an alternate world that cannot be described in one of these reviews. Also hidden away is a demonic villain whose evil is not evident when you first see him. Fred's description of him--&quot;starsnuffer&quot;--sounds a bit silly, but it's accurate.Perhaps the best aspect of this book is that the wizards in it are not simply wizards because they can and because they want to be. The wizards have an integral part in keeping the universe ticking, responsibilities, and pressure to keep doing so. They don't do it for power--they do it because they are good people. This different view is an integral part of the book, that makes it stand apart from much of the kid's fantasy out there.This book cannot be fully absorbed in one sitting--take the time to savor it, and be sure to reread it. It's that good!"},{"Title":"So You Want to Be a Wizard: Young Wizard Series, Book 1","review":"First of all, I find it interesting that another Tulsan wrote about this book, and that I decided to review it so soon after. In my experience, Tulsa is not fertile ground for fantasy-lovers. It was a nice surprise.But anyway...The book. This book heads up a wonderful series that I would recommend to anyone who even remotely likes magic or science. The characters provide deligthful and strong role models for young people. I know I admired them when I first read it at age twelve (I'm now nineteen). I also find Fred to be one of the most endearing characters in all fantasy. (He possesses the same attractive humor as Sunspark in THE DOOR INTO FIRE, which I would strongely suggest to any Duane fan. It's--sadly--out of print, so check your local used bookstore). Another strength of this book is it's sense of place--it is the first book I ever read that really made me want to visit New York.The only warning I would give would be for younger readers. I found the very beginning a little heavy, what with all the science-talk. Just keep going--it's well worth the trouble. Also, make sure to read the next two books. They're wonderful as well. In fact, I'm probably going to write glowing reviews for them as well."},{"Title":"So You Want to Be a Wizard: Young Wizard Series, Book 1","review":"I have read almost every fantasy and sci-fi book that I can find and this was one of the best.

Since the wizardry in the book took a scientific approach, with formualas and the like, I had a hard time latching onto the storyline. Once the characters got rolling and begin working as wizards and begin their Ordeal, the action picked up and I got me interested. I would not recommend this book for anyone younger than, say, eleven. Not because of subject matter, but because I don't think the attention span would last long enough to survive the slow-paced beginning. If you do really like this book, there are three sequals in which the action is constant and you don't have to drudge your way through explanations."},{"Title":"So You Want to Be a Wizard: Young Wizard Series, Book 1","review":"Thirteen-year-old Nita's discovery of the book &quot;So You Want to Be a Wizard&quot; in her local library speaks to every avid reader's desire to find something magical in a book. Nita, of course, with her newfound friend Kit (Christopher), also a novice wizard, goes much further than just finding the book: she's able to do the spells in it, too. The pair is soon involved in a classic test that involves outwitting the prince of evil himself.I read the 350+ pages of this book in a single sitting, and I know I didn't take it all in. It's satisfying at the Harry Potter level, with spells and whatnot, and also at the C. S. Lewis or Charles Williams level, where eschatological catastrophe looms. I'm waiting with great impatience for my eight-year-old to finish the book so that I can reread it. The plot is probably too complex for an eight-year-old, but the details keep his head firmly in the book. The author's inclusion of both a boy and a girl as protagonists helps the book to escape gender stereotyping, and the fact that they have separate strengths and must work together is good for role modeling."},{"Title":"So You Want to Be a Wizard: Young Wizard Series, Book 1","review":"The thing that I most enjoyed about this great book was the approach it took to magic. It didn't have people muttering odd words and have things suddenly start happening. All of the magic was totally &quot;scientific&quot;. It approached magic as a science, not an unexplained phenomenon. The first book (So You Want to be a Wizard) was definetly the best, but also the most frighteningly scary. It was utterly freaky when Nita and Kit were in the alternate Manhattan."},{"Title":"So You Want to Be a Wizard: Young Wizard Series, Book 1","review":"This book gives a whole new approach to magic, the author treating it as a sience, not an unexplained mysterious force, as in other seemingly similar books. It grabs you on the first page and NEVER LETS GO! I was drawn immediately into the &quot;other&quot; Manhattan that the main characters, Nita and Kit, discover. Although the third book in this series is my personal favorite, it is essential to read SO YOU WANT TO BE A WIZARD first; otherwise you would get lost in the sometimes confusing plot and story. I urge any sience-fiction lover (or anyone who wasn't scared off by the cover illustration) to read this. You'll be glad you did."},{"Title":"So You Want to Be a Wizard: Young Wizard Series, Book 1","review":"New York City, especially Manhattan island, is a popular place for paranormal activity in fiction. There are often times gates to other universes (think of the two in the Ghost Busters movies) and in So You Want to Be a Wizard, there is a gate to a very strange alternate New York. Two novice wizards, Kit and Nita, travel to this alternate New York while innocently trying to recover Nita's lost pen. Can they get home and save the world at the same time?While the book is a fairy typical young teen discovers magic is real type of story, I quickly found myself sucked into it. I liked how easily the wizardry fit into the modern world without a separation of societies into muggles and wizards as in the Harry Potter books. Wizardry in Duane's books can be a serious occupation or a hobby or somewhere in between.My one complaint with the book (though this is more a complaint with book two) is the amount of time Duane spends on describing the Speech, a universal language that all wizards and all things in the universe can speak except apparently human adults who have forgotten how to speak it. I like the concept of a universal form of communication but Duane's endless descriptions of how it works and how wonderful it is often time stalls the plot.Fortunately there is enough humor and horror to keep the plot moving. On the humor side, there is Fred, an eager white hole who is excellent at making diversions for Kit and Nita. On the horror side there are the living vehicles (cars, trains, helicopters, and elevators) who are bent on killing each other and eating anything that gets in their way; I will never look at hydrants the same way again!"},{"Title":"So You Want to Be a Wizard: Young Wizard Series, Book 1","review":"\\"This means that all combinations or configurations of emitted particles that have the same energy, angular momentum, and electric charge are equally probable. Indeed, it is possible that the black hole could emit a television set or the works of Proust in ten leatherbound volumes, but the number of configurations of particles that correspond to these exotic possibilities is vanishingly small.\\"- Stephen Hawking, \\"The Quantum Mechanics of Black Holes\\", BLACK HOLES AND BABY UNIVERSESUnless, of course, the black hole in question is having personal problems thanks to something having gone down the wrong way.When two young probationary wizards, Nita and Kit, perform their first cooperative spell (each is trying to avoid being beaten up by other kids, and Nita's trying to get back her special pen from a local bully), they wind up with more than they expected. \\"Fred\\" turns up, looking for an Advisory to whom to report the disappearance of the Naming of Lights, the Bright Book that serves as a kind of operator's manual for the universe. Nita and Kit, like all new-made wizards, have sworn the Oath to serve life and are facing their first great test, the Ordeal which, in its way, is the problem to which *they* are themselves a solution. Wizardry in this system is very much about ethics, and about the power of words to persuade the universe to do what the wizard wants rather than to take its own course.Unfortunately, the Powers That Be which offer wizardry are opposed by the Lone Power, the one among them who invented entropy and death. It's a nice touch of the Young Wizards series that the Lone Power is an interesting character in Its own right, always greeted with defiance as \\"Eldest, Fairest, and Fallen\\", the One that the other Powers wish most of all to put aside its pride and persuade to return to Its former allegiance. Fortunately even the Powers That Be have to conserve their strength, since they can't afford to squander their power in the present when it has to last until the end of time (hence the reason why even the Lone One prefers not to intervene directly except in great need).In a way, this series shares a universe with Duane's STAR TREK novels; \\"wizardry\\" here goes by the name \\"creative physics\\" in THE WOUNDED SKY. It's not anti-science; wizardry and science are closely related, both being concerned with accurate descriptions of reality, whether with words in the Speech or in equations. Spells have to be very carefully executed, particularly the bits that describe exactly who is performing the spell, to avoid accidentally changing the spell-caster."},{"Title":"So You Want to Be a Wizard: Young Wizard Series, Book 1","review":"Diane Duane continuously out does herself in the wizard books!Read them, they will suspend ur belief.

And why is Nita a wizard? This is a great book, I recommend to anyone."},{"Title":"So You Want to Be a Wizard: Young Wizard Series, Book 1","review":"I wish the so-called Golden Age of reading went on for a lifetime. I've been an adult for a decade now, and as I think back on the books I've read in the past ten years, very, *very* few have left so much of themselves in my heart or mind as the stories I pulled out of my grade school libraries. In many cases those magical books wouldn't hold up now. I think, however, that if I had discovered Diane Duane's Young Wizards series at twenty-nine instead of twelve, the first three would still have a place on my bookshelves, and I would still write this glowing review, as theirs is an enchantment that transcends age.Nita and Kit are two kids growing up in New York City. Nita's biggest worry in the world is a gang of bullies who love to beat her. She's that mocked and hated creature, the braniac, and finds refuge in books when she can--it's a pity the world won't let her stay there. But she's going to have larger concerns than one rich brat and her hangers-on very shortly. There's this book she found in the library, you see, that has the intriguing title _So You Want To Be a Wizard_....Some would say wizardry isn't kids' business. None of those people are wizards. Wizards know the eventual death of the universe is everyone's business. Nita has self-defense and maybe a little payback in mind when she takes her Wizard's Oath, but power must be paid for: she and her schoolmate Kit Rodriguez go in just a few days from learning the language of trees and stars to facing down the greatest enemy they can ever know. All the help they can summon won't save their world if their own strength fails. Nita and Kit learn about love and sacrifice, redemption, and powers over which entropy holds no sway.This is probably the 'youngest' of the original trilogy since our heroes begin as normal children with ordinary children's concerns and take awhile to realize the true scope and seriousness of magic. It doesn't matter. The ending is heartwrenching however old you are. Stay with Kit and Nita and they'll make it worth your while; if you're like me you may spend the rest of your life keeping an eye out, wistfully, for a careworn little manual no one but you can see."},{"Title":"So You Want to Be a Wizard: Young Wizard Series, Book 1","review":"If been a loyal fan of Dianne Duane's adult fiction for some. I like the way she confronts difficult themes and makes a story out of them. But, chalk it up to my own waning observational skills; I had no clue that she was a prolific young adult's writer. This was a rare treat, since I'm not at all put off by what age one is supposed to be to read a book. In fact, sometimes I think 'young' adults get all the fun books.Duane's fist book in this series, which features Nita (Juanita) Callahan and her friend Kit Rodriquez who each have discovered a copy of So You Want to Be a Wizard. Who hasn't, at one time or another, wished for a book, a spell, or a wand that will give us special powers to solve the problems the world tends to throw at us. Of course, Nita and Kit quickly discover that magic comes with a great deal of responsibility, and that the 'tests' are a bit more harrowing than those given in school.Wizards, the book explains, are the warriors in the fight against entropy - they work to keep everything from winding down. When one of their early spells goes wrong and calls up a 'white hole' (the opposite of a black hole) named Fred their adventure really begins. Nita asks Fred to retrieve a stolen pen, which Fred inadvertently swallows, and suddenly, instead of emitting radiation, Fred starts emitting things like Lear Jets. To get everything straightened out the three must use a world gate and they find themselves thrust a universe where darkness rules. To escape they must find The Book of Night With Moon and read the world back into existence.This is a complex plot, and a lot happens, but the author takes the time to make Nita and Kit (and Fred too) into very real characters, the kind of people you want to meet again. And fortunately, there are more books in the series, all of which I intend to read. In a world where most popular fiction (for any age group) uses violence as a primary plot device it is refreshing to read a book that depends more on how people live rather than how people die to make its point. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"So You Want to Be a Wizard: Young Wizard Series, Book 1","review":"This is the first book in the So You Want to be a Wizard series, and I loved it!

It's yet another interesting spin on a old fantasy standby, the magic-users which are warlocks, wizards, sorcerers, magicians, enchantresses, witches, sorceresses, etc. It's unlike Harry Potter in the way they gain and use magic. Still, there are similarities between the use of magic and other books and old folklore, such as the importance of language, plants such as rowan, and the moon. The characters of Nita and Kit are likeable as bright outcasts, and Nita's family is nicely done, too. The story is very interesting and action-packed, and Nita and Kit do grow a bit during the storyline, mainly in confidence.There are problems with the book which prevent it from getting five stars from me. While Diane Duane's prose is very good, sometimes it's difficult to get into, and her descriptions can be a little overlong. While it's interesting to know how it feels like to do magic, I don't care to hear about it for two pages.I still love it though."},{"Title":"So You Want to Be a Wizard: Young Wizard Series, Book 1","review":"A recently reread the first three books of this series for at least the third time. I still remeber the first time I read them as a \\"reading vacation\\" looking for something very light, I thought it a YA book, and I guess you can read it that way, at least the first one, but... The underlying metaphor can get very deep, engrossingn and thought provocing. A great story. I thoughouly enjoy these books!"},{"Title":"So You Want to Be a Wizard: Young Wizard Series, Book 1","review":"Frankly, I loved this one. Not as much as the second book in the series perhaps, but...Juanita (Nita) Callahan is a thirteen-year old adult before her time, hopelessly bookish and out of step with the local bullies. What life would be like if her ten-year old brat of a sister didn't have to threaten anyone who tries to beat her up...But her life changes forever one day at the local library when she finds a manual of wizardry masquerading as a kids' book. She just thought she'd get a little magic to solve all her problems. But reciting the Wizards' Oath sends her on an ordeal that pairs her up with the fellow wizard who will become her best friend and takes both of them through darkness, horror, and grief in an alternate version of Manhatten to untapped wells of strength and courage that might even defeat ultimate evil...for the moment.Fresh concept, and Duane doesn't pull her punches. Wizardry is very dangerous, and much of becoming a wizard is whether you can take the heat when wizardry demands far more of you than you thought you were willing to give. It is a commitment to service with serious consequences, not simply a cop-out for solving your own problems.Nita and Kit are both engaging, and their growth and development are sensitively realized."},{"Title":"So You Want to Be a Wizard: Young Wizard Series, Book 1","review":"I waited for MONTHS to find this book, having read Deep Wizardry and High Wizardry first, and it was worth the wait. This is a fantastic book with an excellent plot. It is a bit complicated, and I recommend reading it at least twice to fully understand it. People complain that it's no Harry Potter, and they're right - this ISN'T Harry Potter, it's something more than Harry could be. Not \\"better\\", but MORE. Diane Duane has a fantastic talent in describing things, she really shows you everything.I HIGHLY recommend this; it's one of the best books I've ever read (and that's saying something). If you don't like it, it's probably just because such...deep...sci-fi isn't your cup of tea, and that's great. ........"},{"Title":"So You Want to Be a Wizard: Young Wizard Series, Book 1","review":"This book is very educational and I myself Head Master of Harverd University highly recommend it.Not I think it is an awesome book and everyone should read it.If you don't read it than that is to bad because you are missing out on such an awesome book and awesome deal!"},{"Title":"So You Want to Be a Wizard: Young Wizard Series, Book 1","review":"This book is the first in a series about a girl named Nita and a boy named Kit, and their struggles, experiments, and interesting discoveries towards becoming wizards.I must say, however, that I didn't like it very much. The book is nice in and on itself, but this time the suggested age (9-12) actually fits! Usually I don't pay any attention to that sort of thing, but around 120 pages in the book (after forcing myself to read that far) I simply could not turn another page and still respect myself, even though I had told myself I must finish it. I wasn't even interested in the ending. I see the entire book as quite predictable and possibly a bit too childish, but maybe 9-12-year-olds will like it better.So, in conclusion, if you're above 12, don't buy it."},{"Title":"So You Want to Be a Wizard: Young Wizard Series, Book 1","review":"This was the worst book I have ever read.

I can't believe this series has continued for so long."},{"Title":"So You Want to Be a Wizard: Young Wizard Series, Book 1","review":"I bought this book thinking it was similar to the Harry Potter series (in nature and spirit) but I was very wrong. The characters are acceptable, but the author did a poor job of developing the Kit character... Also the writing is exceedingly dull, the story slogs along at an incredibly SLOW pace...Truthfully I found the story boring... but I read it anyway. I will not be reading the rest of the series.I think the writer's biggest mistake is trying to write the \\"magic\\" as if it were scientifically possible, and she spent way too much time trying to do so... Newsflash! Its MAGIC>>> you know fantasy, you don't need to make it or prove it... fantasy is simply a world that doesn't need explaining or proving.I think someone very young might like this book, but I did not. I am moving on to another series that has better writing."},{"Title":"So You Want to Be a Wizard: Young Wizard Series, Book 1","review":"Although the book had a good premise, the writing style was distasteful and Diane Duane seemed uneducated in the literary field. Duane's voice came through strongly, which I appreciated, but her voice was too childlike and did not sound authoritative or explanatory at all. Too much of the book was \\"filler\\" - like she was trying to make the book longer than necessary."},{"Title":"So You Want to Be a Wizard: Young Wizard Series, Book 1","review":"I thought that this book was just kind of boring.

I cant beleave she made a sequel."},{"Title":"So You Want to Be a Wizard: Young Wizard Series, Book 1","review":"If you're looking for something to hold you over until the next book in the Harry Potter series, don't look here. As a writer of fantasy, Diane Duane makes an excellent science fiction author. If you consider sentient marble-sized galaxies, ferocious living helicopters and predatory automobiles the staple for a book about magic and wizardry, then by all means get yourself a copy. Otherwise, check out some of the more traditional fare, like The Magician's Nephew (or the other books in The Chronicles of Narnia series) by C.S. Lewis, or two shining stars by Madeleine L'Engle: A Wrinkle in Time, and Many Waters."},{"Title":"So You Want to Be a Wizard: Young Wizard Series, Book 1","review":"This book is excellant!

Nita lost her space pen so the two wizards concoct a spell to bring it back, but end up finding a white hole! Fred, the white hole, becomes their friend. Kit and Nita get trapped in a world of darkness and danger. Read this book to find out what happens to these wizards."},{"Title":"So You Want to Be a Wizard: Young Wizard Series, Book 1","review":"This is a very enjoyable series. I'm not a kid, but I read a great deal of fantasy fiction, and once in awhile I'll pick up something from the &quot;teen&quot; section, like this, and Tamora Pierce's books. Sometimes I'm happily surprised. This series is not dumbed down for children, and has an excellent theme throughout. The kids are put through more than most books would dare to do... having to make decisions that most adults would find difficult.These are classic stories of good against evil... with the twist of the idea that no one is beyond redemption.In this series the wizards travel through dimensions, space and time. An excellent read all around."},{"Title":"So You Want to Be a Wizard: Young Wizard Series, Book 1","review":"History:When I was 12 my dad received books in a book club. One day he brought me the latest book, thinking that I might be more interested in it than he would. It was called Support Your Local Wizard. I was interested so I accepted. I'd always liked the idea of magic so this sounded like fun. The book was thick, but I discovered it was three books in one as book club editions often are. This held the first three books of Diane Duane's Young Wizard series. At the time they were the only ones in the series, but since then she has written three more and probably won't stop there. The first three books are So You Want to Be a Wizard, Deep Wizardry, and High Wizardry. This review is of course on the first book.Plot and Characters:I started the book right then and there, sitting in the back seat of the car while my parents ran errands. The book started at a dead run. Literally. We meet our heroin, Nita as she's running from some bullies. The girls chase her through several streets of her suburban New York town. She takes refuge in the local library where she reminisces in the children's section over many books that kept her company during her young childhood. (This caught me right off the bat, as it reminded me a lot of myself.) Of course at age 13 it hadn't been too terribly long ago in her lifetime that she had read these books, but long enough. Running her hand down the isle, a book snagged her finger. She pulled the book out and read the cover. So You Want to Be a Wizard. Like those So You Want to Be... a Doctor or Lawyer or Construction Worker or whatever, but this said Wizard. Intrigued and confused, she sat down to read. What she found changed her life. Mind you all this is just the first couple of pages. From here on in we follow Nita as she starts her life as a wizard after saying the magic oath from the book. The oath is absolutely lovely and of course I memorized it and still recite it to this day.Nita meets her magic partner a little while later in the book. His name is Kit and together they find themselves on their wizardly initiation called the Ordeal. This takes them to another dimension and on a mission to save the Universe form the Lone Power who is one of great evil. Along the way they meet Fred, a white hole who looks like a spark of light, but can \\"eat\\" objects and emit x-rays which he does on occasion when excited. Of course Nita and Kit try to ask him not to do this, but sometimes it slips out. He also gets a case of the hiccups, causing him to emit objects and the humor of what suddenly appears from his little problem is a lot of fun.The other dimension our characters find themselves in is fascinating with no human occupants, but rather evil creatures such as taxi's that try to eat you or killer helicopters. Note that these aren't really very scary, but more of an imaginative addition to the book that Diane Duane adds and it helps give the characters something to work with. Don't worry about your kids getting scared by reading about these things. Other aspects of the alternate dimension are just very involving and will capture young minds and their imaginations if just given half a chance. I'm still surprised these never made it to a place that they deserve amongst other great literature.Our heroes gain a lot of fun abilities with their magic and the unique talents to understand animals when they talk. Nita grows an affinity to plants and has great conversations with a tree in her backyard while Kit starts talking to cars and trains. The finesse by which magic works in these books is one of my favorite parts. In the Harry Potter novels the magic seems very artificial, you do a spell and something happens. Sure the same thing goes in this world, but here there's more of a need to talk to whatever you are trying to change to ask it to change, rather than telling it to. You can't just make a hole appear in a glass pane, you have to ask it to relax and let go of its current need to stick together. Remind it of how nice it was when it was just sand and didn't have to stay in any one place all the time. It's a nice way to use the magic and give respect to objects and creatures rather than forcing your will upon everything.Overall:Now the book is definitely written for young readers, but I think readers of any age would enjoy these novels and many other works of hers. This book will captivate readers of any age and it's not just light hearted fun and games. There's real drama and real things to learn, but there's no blatant moral pushed in your face. I would recommend this to anyone with children that enjoy fantasy novels, as well as adults of course.What didn't I like?I could never find anything in the novels written by Diane Duane that I didn't enjoy. My only complaint is that she isn't as prolific as other authors such as Piers Anthony and several of her books go out of print too quickly. I sure hope to see more of her work soon and I hope you give her a chance. :)"},{"Title":"So You Want to Be a Wizard: Young Wizard Series, Book 1","review":"I first came across this book in the Portland Public Library in almost the same fashion Nita finds the book that opens the door to her beoming a wizard. I was myself a voracious reader, and the aspect of this book that most affected me was the implication that words themselves have the power to change reality. A thoroughly enjoyable read that I have returned to again and again over the years."},{"Title":"So You Want to Be a Wizard: Young Wizard Series, Book 1","review":"This is one of my all-time favorite children's books! The first of a series (4 so far) this and the second (Deep Wizardry) are very good. The characters feel like friends--people with problems just like me. I think the conflict between good and evil is very well done. This isn't a cookie-cutter fantasy, although it does have most of the elements. You'll enjoy it! Word of warning: The first 2 are the best, #3 is very good and #4 (in my opinion) just doesn't quite match up."},{"Title":"So You Want to Be a Wizard: Young Wizard Series, Book 1","review":"I admit that the book has a bit of a slow beginning, but once you get into it you can't stop! It is absolutely amazing! I went out and bought the next two in the series. Diane Duane has original ideas, not just plain old point your finger and magic happens. Definetely get this book if you are a fan of fantasy or science fiction! I also recommend the second book in the series, Deep Wizardry, which could almost be considered even better! But read this first, an extremely wonderful book."},{"Title":"So You Want to Be a Wizard: Young Wizard Series, Book 1","review":"Nita Callahan is on the run again from that snobby bully Joanne again and ends up in her favorite place in the entire world: the library. As the librarian covers for her once again, the thirteen-year-old hides in the children's room downstairs full of old memories and aging books she'd read countless times. Skimming through them, Nita comes across one of those So You Want to Be...books, but this one's named So You Want to Be a Wizard. Strange, she doesn't recall ever reading this one. Next thing she knows, Nita's talking to trees, calling upon mysterious beings from different universes, saving not one, but two worlds from total destruction, and making friends, which is a first. In So You Want to Be a Wizard, Diane Duane writes about Nita and Kit's quest to retrieve the Book of Night with Moon, a magical book that tells of all life everywhere in Speech, the symbolic language of wizards. The battles, strange creatures, and living cars put this book right up there with Harry Potter.The novel deals with magic many readers aren't familiar with. Instead of all the cool gizmos and weird spells, the story uses elements all around us and turns them into things beyond imagination. Kit, Fred, the radiating stranger they called, follow Nita into the alternate world where no humans exist, except for the Starsnuffer, the evilest of all wizards, who rules Manhattan with the thinking cars that play the deadly game of predator and prey, almost killing the trio. As soon as they enter Fred, who solely survives on the light, warns them darkness even darker than their worst fears lies there in wait for them.Although this book is well written, some parts are either too obvious, confusing, or didn't fit in with the plot. For instance, in the beginning of the story, Nita is enraged and cries repeatedly because Joanne took her special space pen after Nita let the bully beat her up again. Most teenagers wouldn't handle the situation like that. Also when the junior wizards sneak into the Starsnuffer's building, the tension builds and builds until his secretary almost catches them, which was the most predictable moment in the book. In other parts, the author doesn't mention the characters' names and sometimes makes the audience re-read the part again to understand the scene, a routine that can get very boring.What was really surprising was the ending, which didn't include lights shooting out of wands, or fancy spells being shouted out into the air. Nita, Fred, and Kit end up in Central Park with the Starsnuffer hot on their trails after they were unable to close the portal that returned them home. Now, of course, is where all the power capable of the children is revealed to all. Nita calls to the trees to forget the hatred that had built after the war with the human race and become a barrier between the Starsnuffer and Kit who was reading the entry from the Book of Night with Moon that could rid the World of the dark monster. He's caught in a trance that worries his friends, but seems to work. He talks to all of Manhattan encouraging it to fight and stand their ground. Suddenly the noise of the busy city fades away and all the talking of the inhabitants disappears as the statues across town come to life from Joan of Arc with her spear and shield, to Teddy Roosevelt shooting wildly at the Starsnuffer as he closes in. Then all is lost when the Starsnuffer takes the moon out of the sky, making the entry fade away and leaving the spell unfinished. Fred decides to make the ultimate sacrificial diversion and floats into the sky and shines everything he's got, producing a false moonlight so now Nita can read the rest. She finishes the spell and makes the Starsnuffer go away, but not before he took Fred's existence with him.Even if So You Want to Be a Wizard has its flaws here and there, the thrills, adventures, and sadness along with the imaginative world of Diane Duane's mind still makes it a superior to other novels.R. Turner"},{"Title":"So You Want to Be a Wizard: Young Wizard Series, Book 1","review":"So You want to be a Wizard is th first book in the hit Young Wizards Series.It tells the tale of 13 year old Junita (Nita) Callahan, who, after narrowly escaping a group of bullies, stumbles into the Library.

I found the first one tucked away at my local library, rather like Nita does in the book. I read it, and kept it in my head ever since. I discovered teh sequels eventually and devoured them as they came. I am ordering the Feline Wizards series, my friend read The Book Of Night With Moon and enjoyed it.How shall I describe these books? You've read Harry Potter, you've read Eragon, but then you read these and all those happy little magic stories crash around your ears and you are stunned by the implications of the powers mentioned there. This book was not \\"look what I can do when I whisper some nonsense words\\", it was \\"wow, I have a gift from the Powers That Be to try and help protect the universe, which I will do, even though the magic is very difficult and exhausts or possibly kills me in large quantities.\\" It is a fantasy, and yet seems downright practical compared with so many other fantasies. It supplies answers for all the questions the other books don't mention, like how you get your powers, and why. I've read all these books, and was entranced by the simplistic, stunning approach to wizrdry as the Art, the practice of helping life in all its forms. THAT is a good reason to say nonsense words, don't you think?! Well, now that I've rambled sufficiently, I'll lay it out: Read this series if you like fantasy and magic, but like science and an intellectual, logical approach to the whole thing, and some of the most epic, clever battles against evil you will ever experience."},{"Title":"So You Want to Be a Wizard: Young Wizard Series, Book 1","review":"My mom recommeded this series to me a while ago, and I'm glad she did. I'm reading the series a bit out of order, but I'm still enjoying it. This is the first book in the series. It begins with Nita, a thirteen-year-old girl who has the misfortune of being beat up a lot by a bully. While hiding in the library, Nita comes across a book called _So You Want To Be a Wizard_. The book gets her on the road to becoming a wizard. In the process, she meets Kit, another young wizard-in-training. There are probably other people who've explained the book better than I ever could, so I'm not going to bother. I really enjoyed this book, because all the characters and their magic seemed so real to me. Also, the author designed some of her world's \\"rules\\" with people like me in mind: early on, Nita reads that one good sign of a potential wizard is that the person can't go to sleep without reading something first. Since this book was enough to make me wish magic were real, those lines made me smile. Hey, I can dream, can't I? I highly recommend this series and book to everyone, young and old."},{"Title":"So You Want to Be a Wizard: Young Wizard Series, Book 1","review":"So You Want to Be a Wizard is a book about a girl named Nita, who finds a book, coincidentally called \\"So You Want to Be a Wizard\\", which is a manual for becoming a wizard. A bully steals her favorite pen, and shortly thereafter she meets Kit, another wizard in training. They band together to try to get the pen back with a spell from their books, but the spell goes wrong, and they go to a dark, miserable version of the world. When they make it out, they find that they brought back a friend from another universe, a white hole in the form of a floating spark, who they call \\"Fred\\". Together, the three go on an adventure together, using magic along the way.One part of the book reminds me of the old story about the lion and the thorn. A man comes across a lion in the desert. He gets scared, thinking the lion will eat him, but instead the lion groans and lifts up his paw, showing a thorn. The man pulls it out, and later the lion helps him out of trouble to repay the favor. In this book, when Nita, Kit, and Fred are in the evil version of Manhattan where machines are alive, they find a Lotus with a piece of metal stuck in it. Kit pulls it out, and later the Lotus saves them from feral taxi cabs.The book is well written, but several times it goes on and on about things which aren't very interesting or important to the story. Other than that though, I liked the book. The story was very creative, and unique (aside from the clich&eacute;, evil, lord of doom type character found in many fantasy stories). The creatures they encountered were original. All of the characters were quite believable, even the ones like Fred, who aren't even people. It is a very fast paced story (aside from the occasional long, droning descriptions) with lots of action. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes fantasy."},{"Title":"So You Want to Be a Wizard: Young Wizard Series, Book 1","review":"I totally loved this book. I have read all the books in the Series so far.....Just waiting for A Wizard of Mars to come out. I love how the magic system actually makes sense.

Totally recommended to all."},{"Title":"So You Want to Be a Wizard: Young Wizard Series, Book 1","review":"I think everyone should read the book So You Want to be a Wizard. It's a book about a girl named Nita who is being bullied and runs into a library and finds a book called So You Want to be a Wizard. It's a great fantasy story; it has a dragon that adds a twist to it. I would recommend this book to any Harry Potter fans. This book is a great magical book. Nita and Kit use their manuals and cast spells. This is an awesome book if you believe in magic. This is an awesome adventurous book. If you like books where kids end up somewhere and get into trouble and have to find their way home, well this is the book you need to read. Last, this book is nothing but suspense. So many unpredictable events occurred I was amazed. But all I have to say is if you believe that wizardry, magic, and fantasy books are for you then you will like this book. This reminds me of another series, which I have read I thought was awesome, was The Keepers. So that's a series close to this but very interesting book to read. So You Want to be a Wizard is a very exciting book, so enjoy yourself and read this book!"},{"Title":"So You Want to Be a Wizard: Young Wizard Series, Book 1","review":"This is a book that you will want to read over and over again.

If you have read Harry Potter and think that this book is probably like it, think again! They have many differences and only some similarities! All I can say is READ THIS BOOK!!!

Not to say it's a poorly written introduction, because it's not, but it may be considered a bit hard to get into. However, once you've gotten into it, you're swept into a highly innovative magical world that has a new surprise at every turn, packing this book with funny, scary, intense, suspenseful, and tearful moments.Now, as for Harry Potter comparsions--Yes, this book is about young wizardsYes, the main villian is sometimes referred to as \\"You-Know-Who\\"Other then those two factors, this book is completely different; not to mention those two can be chalked up to coincidence, for this book was written over ten years before Harry Potter was!The magic in this book is a completely different breed, mixed with philosophy, science, Entrophy, life, and most importantly, the Spoken Word (the \\"Speech\\")Don't try to digest this in one sitting; there's too much information, and you need to absorb the story-- read a few chapters and take a break for the rest of the day, so the plot can rest in your mind and restart the next day.The only problems I have with this book are the sometimes-slow beginning, the fact that chapters are EXTREMELY long, and that explanations can be found to be a bit wordy at times. However, the ending is beyond perfect, and will surely leave you in tears, but with a smile on your face nevertheless.4 Stars."},{"Title":"So You Want to Be a Wizard: Young Wizard Series, Book 1","review":"I am a big fan of magical adventures (Harry Potter, Narnia, Tucker O'Doyle etc.) and found this to be a very interesting read.

I was really intrigued by the idea of the \\"So You Want to be a Wizard\\" book existing in the library in the book itself, and thought it sounded quite good. I was wrong. I have a grievous tendency to finish anything I start; if I read the first book in a series, I have to read all of them. I can't help it.I gritted my teeth through four books in this series before finally I just couldn't take it anymore. The main characters are flat, one-dimensional characters that you could find in almost any children's book written before authors decided children enjoyed characterisation. The magic itself in the books was vaguely dull and unexciting, which, considering that it's magic, says a lot.I have to admit that I haven't read these books in a few years and disliked them so much that I scarcely remember the details. This is coming from someone who loves pretty much every book they read, so it's very rare that I wouldn't remember a book in a very detailed manner. These books are at least one hundred pages too long than they ought to be, and I found myself simply wishing it was over.If you're looking for YA fantasy, try Diana Wynne Jones or Philip Pullman."},{"Title":"So You Want to Be a Wizard: Young Wizard Series, Book 1","review":"when i first got this book i thought it sounded really good. but, when i actually got it and started reading it i just couldn't get into it or relate to it. the characters seemed kinda fake and the whole plot was very unbelievable. i just couldn't even imagine it. there's this 'person' that they can't even name because somehow that makes him even more powerful and they are talking to a white hole ... and it's like how does he talk? and you can't really imagine inanimate objects talking or thinking or even living, which in the book they do. i mean isn't that why they're called non-living? the book itself was good but if you're looking for something that you can relate to more or imagine or if you just want to get into the book then you probably shouldn't count to much on this one.

It has an amazing story line that only some authors can come up with. I really enjoyed the magical methods of carrying out their tasks. When I read a fantasy book, I really want it to take me away into another place and reality and this book acomplished that well. I thought that the creativity of the creatures and entropy were so clever, with all of the carnivorous cars and the dragon in the subway. The setting on New York City really put and interesting twist on the plot that left me thinking, maybe in all of those deep dark places, maybe there really are dragons and wizards saving the planet and the universe every day.

However adults can appreciate it. Although some parts are rather simplistic the climactic battle in central New York was one of the best I have read in adult or children s literature.\\"So You Want To Be A Wizard\\" is the first book in a new series. A misunderstood and bullied 13-year-old named Nita finds refuge in the kid's section of the library. Here she finds a manual that tells her about magic and how to become a wizard. She joins forces with Kit, a 12-year-old Hispanic boy who has skipped several grades due to his intelligence who has also discovered a wizard manual. These manuals are only found by those with an aptitude for magic, who tend to be above average intelligence and usually loners. For unnamed reasons the younger the wizard the greater their powers. Some note is made of the younger the child the more innocence and connection to basic nature of the universe they retain. Together, Kit and Nita, fight an old evil, the power that first unleashed death onto the universe.The book would benefit from little more proofreading and also some attention should be paid to Fred's mode of locomotion. I find it hard to visualize a spark of light as \\"shambling\\", walking or otherwise moving in any manner that does not reflect floating. On a personal preference Fred should be another smaller star because defining him as a white dwarf then making him so powerless seemed silly.As a parent I find this book appropriate for all readers with no sexual overtones, good moral teachings, a strong role model heroine. and implicit criticism of bullying. The book does imply that traditional religions are not correct, although the underlying concept of good versus evil is preserved.From an adult viewpoint most of the book was simplistic. But the last 20% of the book does rise to better written excitement."},{"Title":"So You Want to Be a Wizard: Young Wizard Series, Book 1","review":"Loved this Book.Humor and creativity.Friends and family.Everyone should read this!I fully recommend this book to you!"},{"Title":"So You Want to Be a Wizard: Young Wizard Series, Book 1","review":"As an adult, I must say I love this series.The thought behind the process of magic and what wizards are and how they work rings in a way that I don't often see in magic-based books. The author directs this to children without patronizing then or pandering with cheap theatrics.I have read the series up to the latest book, book nine, and have enjoyed the character development and complexities.I eagerly wait the next book."},{"Title":"So You Want to Be a Wizard: Young Wizard Series, Book 1","review":"The main character is interesting, but her motivations for getting herself in quite so much trouble are not clearly enough spelled out. The plot is also engaging, but the final battle is simply too drastic to fit well with the assumptions the author left us with early in the book. If magic is really supposed to be secret, you can't have a battle for the fate of the world in the middle of a large city."},{"Title":"So You Want to Be a Wizard: Young Wizard Series, Book 1","review":"I really enjoyed this book, I finished a third read tonight. I wish I could have read it in high school. It is very well structured, with imaginary resources that are self-consistent. It was a joy to read this. The style was very simple, and I could immediately go into the story, without slogging through the words. A fun read. I could compare it toThe Chronicles of Chrestomanci, Volume 1: Charmed Life / The Lives of Christopher Chant, orHarry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (Book 1), but it has a charm all its own. I have read every book in the series."},{"Title":"So You Want to Be a Wizard: Young Wizard Series, Book 1","review":"Nita Callahan, perennial geek on the bad side of the school bully, runs across an unusual book while hiding in the children's section of the town library: So You Want to be a Wizard. She thinks it's a joke until she starts learning real magic (or rather, wizardry) from it. But it's not all fun and games when Nita and fellow wizard Kit accidentally end up in an alternate universe that's not at all friendly to humans.Duane's fantasy (with a sci-fi twist) is a joy to read and only gets better as the series goes on. What other system of magic uses terminology like temporal-spacial claudication instead of magic door? The writing is clean and crisp, the worldbuilding is fantastic, and the characters are wonderful and come in ever-expanding varieties. This series is a yearly-reread."},{"Title":"So You Want to Be a Wizard: Young Wizard Series, Book 1","review":"good readable story. One could reasonably read a half chapter a night for a tween, or even a young teen. Reading for children is a fantastic way to improve a child's skills, one does need good books, and this is a good book, if a bit dark in places. That's appropriate- children know what darkness is, they need stories on how to master it, and fill it with light."},{"Title":"So You Want to Be a Wizard: Young Wizard Series, Book 1","review":"A very good choice for kids 11+ It has a little of everything.

From the first moment I picked it up, I was hooked."},{"Title":"So You Want to Be a Wizard: Young Wizard Series, Book 1","review":"When I was a boy, the Young Wizards series first taught me what it felt like to be so thoroughly caught up in a story that I could feel the energy in every word, and I forgot to breathe when turning the pages. Years later I'm nearing my thirties, and a sense of nostalgia prompted me to hunt these books down again. I was expecting to find them simplistic and dull; instead I found myself just as enraptured, and admiring the effervescent yet clean writing style, and the flawlessly paced storytelling.Duane creates sympathetic characters who are smart, snappy, yet wonderfully flawed in believable and understandable ways; her young protagonists are mature and deal with very adult problems while retaining a sense of innocence and wonder that is sometimes lost in newer, grittier YA tales (although there's nothing wrong with those less innocent tales, either; each has its place).Nita and Kit are great role models for younger readers without being trite, dull, or overly vanilla--and the story offers some pretty heavy life lessons without beating you about the head with them. For an older reader, it's a great trip back to the excitement of youth, and a wonderful escape from the banality of everyday life. For just a little while, Duane's books can give you magic."},{"Title":"So You Want to Be a Wizard: Young Wizard Series, Book 1","review":"Diane Duane is one of the most accomplished, and underrated authors of our time, so it's no suprise that she would come up with such a wonderful body of work.Nitas' journeys as a wizard are quite often comparable to the overwhelming experience of adolescence itself. While I know of few people that would enjoy being chased by the dark force in the universe, I know a lot who have had problems with bullies, and know just how hard it is to make new friends, especially when you're not sure of yourself.After re-reading this story in its trillogy form, I can still say it keeps me enveloped in its own magical web, drawing the reader in.And who's to say there isn't a real Juanita Callahan out there somewhere, saving the world?"},{"Title":"So You Want to Be a Wizard: Young Wizard Series, Book 1","review":"Thirteen year old Nita Callahan is perfectly ordinary, until she is chased by a pack of bullies. She runs into the local library and in the Children's Section. Nita lets her fingers browsers through old familiar books she had read before until she came across the 'So You Want to Be a....' series. Her suddenly caught the name 'So You Want To Be A Wizard'! She borrows it and reads it at home &quot;This has to be a joke.&quot; Nita says. But on her way home Joanne and her group [the bullies] beat her up.Nita walks home, feeling sore and tired, but finishes the book. She finished the book and thinks she can do all these spells to stop Joanne from beating her up. She reads the oath aloud, but nothing happens. The next day she figures out she's a wizard, when she was walking to school she hears a tree talking to her.Nita, her new wizard friend Kit and Fred, a white hole, go 1st to Manhatten where the Lone Power has taken over, to help Fred stop all his emmisions, which are caused by hiccups. But then they are trapped there, where cars tear each other up and helicopters also kill. They are there to find 'The Book Of Night With Moon.' to save Manhatten and the world from the Lone Power or the starsnuffer.Exciting this book is, full of adventure and mystery. If you like Patricia C. Wrede, Susan Cooper or any sci-fantasy, fantasy, So You Want To Be A Wizard is the perfect book for you.This book is one where you can take your time reading it leisurely. Let yourself be absorbed in Duane's world of magic and fantasy. You will find [if you ever rate it] that it'll be five star. That's how well Diane Duane writes! Enjoy!"},{"Title":"So You Want to Be a Wizard: Young Wizard Series, Book 1","review":"Thirteen-year-old Juanita \\"Nita\\" Callahan has never had it easy. Thanks, in large part, to her very own, personal bully, Joanne. A rich girl with nothing better to do than make Nita's life miserable. Which is how Nita ends up in the city library. For, one Saturday afternoon, as she is trying to avoid the wrath of Joanne and her cronies, Nita ducks into the library, and stumbles across something that will change her life forever. Something that will take care of the problems in her life, and make bullies and unkind classmates a thing of the past. A something that will give Nita the opportunity to leave her own world behind, and enter a parallel universe. One where adventure, danger, and friendship that fights to the death prevails, and Nita must take her place as a hero. And that something is nothing more than a book titled So You Want To Be A Wizard. Nita is skeptical at first, feeling that it is a joke. A trick of the eye. But, even so, she takes the book along with her, and pores over it during dinner that evening, only to discover that the words on the cover are not a joke. This book actually gives you the power to become a wizard. And, as Nita soon discovers, she is not the only wizard living in her area. For she soon meets Kit, a 12-year-old boy suffering from the same afflictions as Nita (the bully syndrome), and, together, the two young wizards decide to team up with one another to take part in a magic Ordeal. One that will bring each of them into their full Wizardly powers, and take them on the adventure of a lifetime.With so many fantasy books on the market today, it is hard to decipher which ones will bring you an adventurous thrill ride, and which ones will fall flat, making you wish that you had opted for something else to read. With Diane Duane's SO YOU WANT TO BE A WIZARD, it is evident from page one that you are in for an adventurous thrill ride that won't disappoint. Duane's characters are enchanting and relatable; while the information regarding bullying and trouble with classmates is true to form, and will leave all readers bobbing their heads in agreement. Nita and Kit are fun characters, whose roller coaster ride through Manhattan is hard to resist; as is their white hole of a pal, Fred. While there are times when the talk of magic and wizardry does become a bit confusing, the characters, and amazing dialogue make up for it, and, eventually get you back on track, leaving the reader craving more. Overall, SO YOU WANT TO BE A WIZARD is a magical roller coaster ride that should come with the warning keep your arms and legs inside at all times, for the various twists and turns on each page will leave you breathless.Erika SoroccoFreelance Reviewer"},{"Title":"So You Want to Be a Wizard: Young Wizard Series, Book 1","review":"This book really got me hooked on Diane Duane. My mom works at a library and she came home with this book. I looked at it and passed immediate judgement: I didn't think it would be to good of a book; but having nothing better to do, I picked it up and could not (and did not!) put it down until I was finished. After that I begged to go to the bookstore so I could get the others, and now it's one of my favorite series books (I might add that there's another one coming out: The Wizard's Deliema).In the book you first meet Nita, who's running from a lot of bullies that are out to get her. Luckily, the library is open late on saturdays and she finds sancuary in there. She doesn't even really notice the book, the book notices her! It seems to (as she puts it) snag her hand.She takes the book home, thinking it's a jest and starts to read it, finding out that Wizardry is much more than just a fairy tale.A bit later when she wants to start her first bit of magic in her special place (a glave), the trees tell her that there is someone else practicing magic.There she stumbles upon her partner-to-be, Kit, and they manage to preform their first bit of spell work together, unfortuately, things go a bit awry...I strongly suggest anyone who likes fantasy read these books, they are terrific, and although I can't guarantee it will be a page turner for you in particular, I'll say it was for me and I'll bet it will be for SOME of you out there!"},{"Title":"So You Want to Be a Wizard: Young Wizard Series, Book 1","review":"I love this book. It is a great: a little like Harry Potter only has more of an adult plot a.k.a. more complicated. I feel in love with this book and immediatly bought Deep Wizardry, High Wizardry, and A Wizard Abroad (All contiuations of the series, which gets better as you go). And if you love cats, check out Book of Night With Moon, which fetures Wizarding Cats and all your favorite characters from the other books...."},{"Title":"So You Want to Be a Wizard: Young Wizard Series, Book 1","review":"I read this novel originally when I was 13. Geeky,bespectacled, and female, I found a lot to love about the plucky protagonist of this novel, Nita. Ten years later, I still love this novel as one of the best fantasies ever written for young adults. It doesn't talk down to them in the least, and it presents a true-to-form view of the day-to-day life of a teenage girl...that is, until the magic slowly creeps into her life.Diane Duane's magical vistas of the alternate Manhattan have to be read to do them justice - they pulse with life, they taunt us with a world just out of our reach and view. She provides a richly populated world in which even the trees hold philosphical debates, and where each bit of life is precious. Her villians are grounded firmly in the best mythology but illustrated with such freshness that you may just forget that you've seen this kind of villian in many types of literature. Every act, every breath carries a magical resonance that will haunt the reader for years to come after reading this novel.I look forward to sharing this novel with the young people in my life, and with my children in the future. Give Diane Duane a chance - you'll never see the mundane world as so drab again."},{"Title":"So You Want to Be a Wizard: Young Wizard Series, Book 1","review":"I am now over twenty, but can clearly remember reading this in my preteen years. I am now a Computer Science major, and my road to be interesting as a person, and to being a geek, was helped, or even started, by this book. Ms. Duane's beautifully crafted story is perfect for young people, in that it inspires and makes you wonder, and leaves some of the more serious issues that often come with this genre for a later age. If you have a niece, nephew, son, or daughter interested in reading fantasy, I highly recommend this book as a gentle introduction into this genre."},{"Title":"So You Want to Be a Wizard: Young Wizard Series, Book 1","review":"Diane Duane has the gift of writing.

Even I, who hate most Science fiction books, was drawn into her Harbringer Trilogy, and, as I love fantasy, Totally immersed in her Wizardry Series and in her Feline Wizards Series. I'm proud to be one of her fans, and would find I needed much more interesting books if I wasn't.

Instead of the author using ideas like Unicorns and dragons She makes up her own mythical creatures that are so much more interesting and wonderous than say a werewolf or unicorn. The story brings the characters into a dark manhatten with trouble and even some terror around every corner as they try to battle their way against the sinister and evil lone power. So set aside Harry Potter...This story is way better!!(Not that Harry Potter books are no good but[in fact they're great, yet Harry Potter is a close second behind this one]this story is much more exciting):-)"},{"Title":"So You Want to Be a Wizard: Young Wizard Series, Book 1","review":"Nita's a smart bookworm that constantly gets in trouble with the school bully's becasue she refuses to fight back.

The war between the Powers well depicts a godly argument, and the integration between magic and modern is excellent. The magic language and the spells are great, except I would like to see a little more variety in magical methods. Still, this is the first book I read that made me truly tolerate a magic system where spells required so many RUNES! Oh well. This book is excellent, all in all. It makes me want to become a wizard myself. I can see what the characters see and feel what they feel. This is one of the books that made me decide to become an author. One of my favorite parts is the office scene with the Lone Power where they make being omnipotent seem run-of-the-mill. I especially like the strange typist. I will never forget Fred.

Wizard centers on 13-yr-old Nita, a picked-upon young teen, and 12-yr-old Kit, another lonely young teen. Nita, taking refuge from bullies in the local library, stumbles across the reference book providing the title of the novel and into the world of wizardry. Shortly afterward, she meets up with Kit, who himself has just become a wizard.While the two of them have their share of whimsical uses for their magic (revenge on the bullies, tracking down a stolen pen), wizardry is not play. To become wizards each has taken a life-long oath that boiled down means they're responsible at all times for pretty much everything--life (and \\"life\\" doesn't simply mean human life) and the universe--and may be asked to sacrifice themselves in the service of life.Despite the underlying seriousness of their adventures (a clash between the One--the creator--and the Lone One who left the One's service and brought death/entropy into the world), there is also quite a bit of humor and light play, especially involving a white hole as a character. The parallel universes Nita and Kit find themselves in are vividly original and the Manhattan that arises in the climactic battle against the Lone One is beautifully captured.The book moves along at a quick pace, the characters themselves are likable and realistic and better yet, develop as the story goes along and as the series goes along as well, deepening into their maturing roles as wizards and as young adults. Despite the magical storylines, there is a nice down-to-earth feel about the books, a matter-of-fact atmosphere that makes suspension of disbelief quite easy with regard to the magic. This first book is a good book on its own, but the series improves as it goes along for the most part and a reader who sticks with it is rewarded with more full explanations and better, deeper characters. Recommended."},{"Title":"So You Want to Be a Wizard: Young Wizard Series, Book 1","review":"This book is a far step more advanced and original than any of the new Harry Potter-type fantasy books. It brings you into new universes that only Diane Duane's books could unleash to the world. I bought this book yesterday and finished it already after reading vigorously for the past day and night, this is a book that once you open you won't be closing until you've read every last word. It keeps you on the edge of your seat with the out of this world thrills and adventures of Kit and Nita. I can't wait to read the rest of the series!Also, if you plan on buying this book I would suggest the 20th Anniversary Hardcover edition, as the cover illustrations are gorgeous and who can resist a good hardbound fantasy book?"},{"Title":"So You Want to Be a Wizard: Young Wizard Series, Book 1","review":"So You Want to Be a Wizard is the book that the first of the Harry Potter's books really wanted to be, and almost became. While tapping into the universal desire to be somebody Great and Important, the Duane book does it in a way that is identifiable not just by but with every child who has felt like an outsider.

The transitions between dialogue and internal monologue are like hitting a speed bump. The characters come off as flat and whinny. The mechanics of the world are boring. It almost seems like this book was written by a committee. We need to buy some time to pad the story what should be put here? Oh just some random stuff...I could go on, but I don't care enough.

I would add the following.It takes a little while to get up to speed on how time works in this world, even with the helpful exposition provided by two friendly wizards. You really have to understand how alternate universes work in this book in order to follow the plot and appreciate the action. That's fine, and the way it all works is very satisfying. However, I think it would be very challenging and probably frustrating for the 8 or 9 year old that the publisher claims this book is aimed toward. I'm thinking more like 11 years old, and probably after having been introduced to some other sci-fi quest books first."},{"Title":"So You Want to Be a Wizard: Young Wizard Series, Book 1","review":"I have read a lot of science fiction novels including the &quot;Wrinkle in Time&quot; trilogy and the Philip Pullman Trilogy. This was the best book of all of them. It was not as confusing as Madeleine L'Engle's novels and not as emotional as Philip Pullman's stories. It had humor, suspense, mystery, and all kinds of other things mixed throughout it. It also had great descriptions and characters. It introduced a new sci-fi storyline as well, not just another good versus evil with confusing stuff in between.

I was disappointed. The plot doesn't make a lot of sense after the initial setup that puts the wizarding instruction book in the hands of the protagonist--a \\"white hole\\" star has a conversation with the kids over a period of days for instance, really just out of nowhere. The kids plunge into doing very sophisticated magic right away and the philosophy of the magic that gets done, if you can call it that, is of the sophmoric \\"everything is alive and has feelings\\" variety, including rusting cars. I couldn't bear to read it aloud after a while. Skimming it might be ok."},{"Title":"So You Want to Be a Wizard: Young Wizard Series, Book 1","review":"If you are an avid reader but not into fantasy, don't read thisbook. I'm a reader who doesn't particularly like fantasy, but I'veread many fantasy books which people have said are very good. Most of those I liked, but not this one. So you want to be a Wizard is good in the first couple chapters, but as the magic gets more intense, I found it hard to follow. My friends who are into fantasy and sci-fi loved this book, so if you are like them, go ahead, read this book. But if you are like me, and want to try a fantasy book, don't read this. I recommend Harry Potter and Ender's Game instead."},{"Title":"So You Want to Be a Wizard: Young Wizard Series, Book 1","review":"This book is great and really magical. It's about these two kids who discover a whole new world then the one they know. My kids enjoyed Harry Potter, and this book is just as good, but it shows this different magic. A magic that is more usuall unlike the one in Harry Potter. We really enjoyed this book, and all the other in the series."},{"Title":"So You Want to Be a Wizard: Young Wizard Series, Book 1","review":"This book introduces the two main characters that will stay with this series up to as far as I have read into the series, which is up to book five. The two main wizards are Nita and Kit. The story begins with Nita having a horrible bully problems (she has a big mouth that she can not control). Day Nita is chased into the local library. As she is browsing through the children's section, in order to duck out from the bullies chasing her, she notices a book that she has never seen in the library before. It was titled So You Want to be a Wizard. Nita took the book home and found an oath inside the first few pages of the book. It was the wizard's oath. Nita did not know this when she accepted the oath but when she read it she had sworn herself to the powers and to protect anything worth living. The next day when she awakened Nita took another look into the book, or manual. Nita found a section in the book that supposedly listed some of the \\"wizards\\" in the area that she lived in. As she briefly skimmed down the list of names she was abruptly stopped when she had discovered her name in black and white.Nita was very confused but that was not the weirdest part. All of a sudden Nita could talk to trees. The trees told her about another boy wizard who was using their branches for spells without asking and how it was aggravating the trees. Nita was happy that she would find another wizard but also a little creped out because she was finding this boy wizard from the gossip of a few trees. The boy that was doing the damage was Kit. Kit and Nita become friends realizing how their powers work and how their powers were different. They decide to do a spell together that does not go as plan. They accidentally (if accidentally does exist in wizardry) braught something into earth that was not suppose to be there. This is the part of the book where it gets a little scientific and theoretical, but from what I can remember what they brought was either a white black whole or a special type of star. Now I know what you are thinking that if you bring something in with that much gravity you got problems but it was not exactly like that. After the spell was over they saw the being in a true form. All it was a small floating light that communicated with people through thought and the speech. The speech is a wizard type language that all complex enough living things and non-living things speak. That is Nita can talk to trees as well as other things. Anyway the reason Fed, as they call their new outer planet friend, does not have a gravity problem is that it has all that energy and gravity stored in other places. The duos eventually bite off almost more than they can chew. They enter an alternate New York City where the things are just evil. Especially the things that are not living. The Lone Power created this world. The Lone Power is the very thing that created death in the beginning of time. He is the wizards' worst enemy.The book has an interesting ending that I do not want to ruin for you. In my opinion I would recommend this series of books to anyone but I do have to warn you the first series, which is the one I am writing about, is a little.... well...slow no that is not it...it is.... boring at times. Ya that is the right answer. Hope you like the book and/or series.P.S. Dian Duane, the author of this book, is a great author."},{"Title":"So You Want to Be a Wizard: Young Wizard Series, Book 1","review":"In this book, two young kids find a book called 'So You Want to Be a Wizard'. This dramatically changes both of their lives as they begin to study the magical art.This story has action, humor, and magic. I thought that the story was very unique and interesting, a twist on the Harry Potter series, but at some moments I found that an important piece of action would happen in half a sentence and I had almost missed it. In my opinion, it was a good book for younger and less advanced readers that sometimes lacked detail. Recommended to both boys and girls ages 8-10."},{"Title":"So You Want to Be a Wizard: Young Wizard Series, Book 1","review":"My friend had the second book with her at camp and I asked about it. The cover was interesting enough with the two children riding on the back of a whale with spiralling mists and waves all around them. And by accident, I read the second book first. But, I didn't know enough about the two main characters, Nita and Kit, to understand the story. So I went back and read the first one. Excuse me. Correction: I inhaled it. I turned every page with great anticipation and eagerness. I loved the creativity. Who needs to travel to Hogwarts, when you can just find the spells in a library book called \\"So you want to be a Wizard\\". Personally, going to the library is a lot easier than going through a brick wall.The story begins when young Nita Callahan is chased by a group of bullies into the library. While the librarian gets rid of the bullies, Nita looks down the library shelves at books labeled \\"How to\\". How to be an airplane pilot, a football star etc. Then she finds the book \\"So you Want to be a Wizard\\". A book that she soon discovers has an oath that gives you wizardly powers to help save the world from The Lone Power.After a while, Nita finds a boy's name in the listing of of local wizards, and finds her close neighbor, a person she never really knew before, Kit Rodriguez. And the two soon discover that the lone power has turned Manhattan into a run down city of inatimate objects that would sooner rip you to pieces than ask you for directions. And in the new Manhattan, The Lone Power is hatching a plan to turn the whole world into chaos and destruction, just like his own Manhattan. This is a story that doesn't have a school of wizardry, but has more magically convoluted plot that is set in modern days than any other book I've read.Ok, so Harry Potter is good, but don't say anything about Harry Potter until you've read this! Superb adventure! I reccomend the whole series!"},{"Title":"So You Want to Be a Wizard: Young Wizard Series, Book 1","review":"Nita and later Kit become wizards after stumbling across wizarding manuals, and swear oaths of loyalty to uphold the sacred task of being a wizard. Now all they have to do is prove their worthiness on an ordeal. Along their way the meet wonderful characters like Tom& Carl who are senior wizards, Fred the white hole of energy, and the lone power.These books offer a wonderful yet serious take on magic. It's not a \\"here's a wand, wave it\\" magic, but one that actually makes sense in it's world. There are risks to using it, prices to be paid, but a reward for doing the right unlike any other. That anchors the plot more then books of the similar like ever have. The use of cosmic forces and the book's wizards, also gave it a wonderful spin.The plot slides toward predictability sometimes, but it's originality with concepts and scenes redeemed it then.Diane Duane has created a lovely book to start off a series that explore the cost of using magic, and the wonderful journey that magic will take you on."},{"Title":"So You Want to Be a Wizard: Young Wizard Series, Book 1","review":"This is a magical book, in a magical universe with magical characters and real tears. This is a classic, the sort that I always have a copy of, the sort that I give to my kids."},{"Title":"So You Want to Be a Wizard: Young Wizard Series, Book 1","review":"Nita and Kit, two thirteen year olds in Manhattan, discover that magic is real and taking place every day, in every corner of the world. This book is packed with magic and action. It is an amazing start to a fantastic series.The beginning of So You Want to Be a Wizard got my attention right away because it reminded me of the opening sequence of The NeverEnding Story. Here, Nita runs into the library to hide from bullies; in TNES, Bastian runs into the bookstore to hide from bullies. The power of books becomes literal in both stories, with Nita embracing magic and The NeverEnding Story encouraging imagination.So You Want to be a Wizard may have come out over twenty years ago, but it is a timeless tale. It is set in our world; however adept they become, the teen wizards still have to go to school, do their homework, and clean their rooms. Descriptive, innovative, and touching, So You Want to Be a Wizard is a book to treasure and to share."},{"Title":"So You Want to Be a Wizard: Young Wizard Series, Book 1","review":"\\"So You Want to Be a Wizard\\" by Diane Duane is definitely a book worth reading. It all starts out with Nita when she finds a book about how to become a wizard in the library. At first she just thinks its an elaborate joke, how could magic really exist? But nevertheless, she ends up taking the oath to become a wizard, and that's when she finds out that magic does exist. After she becomes a wizard, she can suddenly hear everything around her - trees, rocks, and even cars, talking in the speech, the magical language all wizards use. On her first day out trying magic, she meets up with another wizard, Kit. Together they somehow manage to summon a \\"white hole\\" from space. Apparently a white hole is the opposite of a black hole, instead of sucking objects in, it spits them out. But anyways, Nita tries to use this white hole, which they name Fred, to get her pen back from a bully who stole it. Unfortunately, during this Fred accidentally swallows the pen, and in order to get it back they must go to the worldgate and perform magic. While they are trying to perform the magic necessary, something goes wrong and they end up in a very twisted Manhattan. This world is ruled by cars that have minds of their own, and there is no sun or moon in the sky. Also, Nita and Kit find out that this twisted world was created by Starsnuffer, a being from the beginning who turned evil.While in this other world, Nita and Kit battle with many things, among which include cars and a dragon, in order to get the \\"Book of Sun With Moon\\". Apparently this book contains descriptions of every thing that every existed and ever will. When read from, things will be set right as they should be according to the book. Both Nita and Kit know that if they let Starsnuffer keep it, he will use it for his own evil purposes. Therefore, after rescuing the book they go back through the world gate into their own world, with their own regular Manhattan. However, the portal will not close, and Starsnuffer follows them through. After this, the ending to the book that comes is a bit surprising. Instead of the end happening with a great battle with wands and destructive spells, the world is saved by reading from The Book of Sun With Moon. But there is one quirk to this - to see anything in the Book of Sun With Moon, there must be moonlight present, and Starsnuffer had turned off the sun, which meant the moon had no light. Next Fred decides to make the ultimate sacrifice for his friends, he goes up into the sky and blows himself up, creating enough light to relight the moon. Together, Nita and Kit finish reading from the Book of Sun With Moon. When they reach the part that mentions Starsnuffer's name, the spells that are supposed to bind him are specified in the book, and Starsnuffer is again bound, far away where he can cause no trouble. Lastly, the part about Manhattan is read from the book, and everything in Manhattan is set right, as it should be, without violent cars with minds of their own.I found this to be a very good book, and am definitely interested in reading the next book in the series. However, no book is without some bad points, and this book is no different. For example, I sometimes found that what was going to happen in some situations was too predictable. It is always nice when I can read a book and be surprised when the predictable thing I thought was going to happen doesn't. However, besides that I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good fantasy book that doesn't contain too much fantasy."},{"Title":"So You Want to Be a Wizard: Young Wizard Series, Book 1","review":"So you want to be a wizard is one of the best book ive ever read the only thing wrong with it are this two things:very hard spelling and a gothic book,other than that its great the descriptions of the enviornment are great,there is action,magic and adventure.i dont recommend it to children under 13 because its kind of scary at some points,anyway the book is about a girl who is hiding from bullies in the library and there she encounters a book called so you want to be a wizard,she thinks is bogus,but she starts reading it and discovers that the wizards job is to preserve energy and a bunch of other stuff.she reads the wizards oath and the next day inside the book is her name she became a wizard!!!later she encounters more wizards(CARL TOM and KIT)and a white hole(fred)kit,nita and fred journey to manhanttan and go through a portal to another world where a lone power rules(he created death and entropics)there they confront perytons(kind of a wolf-human,mostly wolf)living cars and trains,dragons and the lone power itself.now i wont tell you anymore just read it and you will find out"},{"Title":"So You Want to Be a Wizard: Young Wizard Series, Book 1","review":"This is a great book and the series is really good too.

That didn't last long - I was finished it barely after Christmas break had started! Anyway, I liked it a lot and decided to start from the beginning.&quot;So You Want To Be A Wizard&quot; was good, but not great. Since I'm not a seasoned science fiction reader (I go more for high fantasy) I found some of the technical terminology that Duane uses somewhat confusing. The magic that the wizards use in this book is a mixture of scientific equations and traditional magic like that we see in Harry Potter, complete with wand-waving. It's an original and unusual way to look at the ageless myths of magic and wizards, sorcery and battles against evil, and I would recommend it to those who like sci-fi and even some who like fantasy. But, if high fantasy is more what you're looking for, I suggest Tamora Pierce's &quot;Song of the Lioness&quot; quartet."},{"Title":"So You Want to Be a Wizard: Young Wizard Series, Book 1","review":"People today do not beleive in magic, but one day a teenager, Nita, finds one of those So You Want to Be a... books but this one says So You Want to Be a Wizard.

I was extremely disappointed. The author shows very little originality in her work; but lifts entire concepts and plotlines from other well known children's stories; A Wrinkle in Time, The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe and The Neverending Story for a start -- Even the completely original bits aren't satisfying, because the characters other than Nita are very shallow, the descriptions are poor, and the magic and premises are taken too lightly. Good fantasy is written so you believe the magic and situations are real -- they are described, and given substance in the text. This author takes the magic for granted, and gives only the slightest preparation of the premise or explanation of what is happening; trusting the history of the fantasy genre to substantiate her writing. I also disliked this author's tendency to repeat herself. Most annoying to me is the cheap looking typeface on each page.

That wonderful story is in this book, but unfortunately it would take needle nose pliers to pull it out.\\"So You Want to Be a Wizard: The First...\\" tries so hard to be on par with other popular books about wizardry that it throws every device from the canon into the mix. The result is a story that is deeply convoluted with one dimensional characters and strangely familiar situations. I believe the potential exists to develop this series and I understand why a publishing house would want it, but what I don't understand is why the editor took a vacation when the first and second drafts were handed in?Let me get it out of the way (in regards to she who must not be invoked in every review of every magical children's novel.) I don't believe Ms. Rowling alone has cornered the market on the wizarding genre even if she did up the ante and help redefine it.I haven't moved on to other books in this series, but it is my hope that they will give more depth to the main characters and be more choosy about what ideas are developed and what ideas are left for another day (or book.)"},{"Title":"So You Want to Be a Wizard: Young Wizard Series, Book 1","review":"This book is OK.

When I'm the storyteller, I make sure we have ghouls in our games and I love when players are willing to take on ghouls as characters. Why? They are an interesting combination of vampire and human, a mixture of emotions, and far more powerful that most storytellers and players would like to believe. This book gives you some insights into ghouls though I've seen other passages in other &quot;world of darkness&quot; books which should have been included here. I was expecting a read guide to all ghouls you see so that did disappoint me greatly. The pictures are probably some of the scariest in the series and in fact have turned off one really great player from being a ghoul -- very sad because he was so talented and he had such potential as this character.

Well, I am, and have been for a dozen years. making real chronicles for real characters, many games without a dice roll to be found. And I *hated* the premise of this book.Why?Because they tried to take away my freedom. They've been doing this a lot with official supplements. In the original supplements, they gave you a flavor for ghouls, just a taste, and several different suggestions. One of them was the blood junkie mentality, one was the stubborn independent, one was the loyal but stupid slave,etc. And left it to you to define your ghouls.Now they're telling me how each clan treats its ghouls. Not how some older members treat them, not how the majority treats them. Basically, every Kindred in existence treats their ghouls like dirt on the bottom of their shoes if they're not dissecting them for the amusement of their friends and the ghouls take this treatment willingly because they're *all* essentially heroin junkies needing their next fix. Great. Thanks for taking away the variety. I've played ghouls like this. But what made them stand out was their uniqueness, their difference from other ghouls the PCs run into. One of these days White Wolf is gonna stop telling me how to play. Their supplements are supposed to enable me to make a chronicle to hold my players attention, be it horror, action, intrigue, whatever.

Some of it deals with rather adult content, but this is White Wolf we're talking about here: almost EVERYTHING in the World Of Darkness is adult, mature, scary, and...well, dark.I didn't find it frightening at all. Then again, this comes from a guy who read Clanbook: Baali without batting an eyelid.So if I had to &quot;warn&quot; others about the adult content of this book, I'd honestly say that it's nothing out of the ordinary in the World Of Darkness."},{"Title":"Ghouls: Fatal Addiction (Vampire: The Masquerade)","review":"This book is by far most the best book out there on a vampire's slave.

Whenever someone makes a ghoul, they simply make up some stats and a name. There's more to it than that. And this book shows you that there is more to a ghoul than just a weak lackey.

They'll do anything to get just one drop."},{"Title":"Ghouls: Fatal Addiction (Vampire: The Masquerade)","review":"You don't need this book to play ghouls or have them in your game.

Unfortunately some chapters appear twice, first in the subjective view of an ghoul or vampire then described in an objective rules-style. This seems rather odd and makes reading a bit boring.Though the book has many details about the ghouls&#65533; anatomy, it lacks information on the perception of ghouls via disciplines such as Auspex, Thaumaturgy etc. Can you &#65533;see&#65533; only her or ever her domitor? Etc.If you are a vampire, always remind every ghoul, even if she loves you, might be a threat and kill you one day without warning."},{"Title":"The Last Days of Henry VIII : Conspiracies, Treason and Heresy at the Court of the Dying Tyrant","review":"If you're a Tudor buff, you'll love this book even though it portrays Henry VIII as a monster. Hutchinson believes that Henry was responsible for some 150,000 deaths. Towards the end of his life he was so viciously unpredictable his courtiers must have been in constant fear that they would go next to the block. His severe illness pushed him over the brink of any sense of fair play or decency. He was always a tyrant, however.What was Henry's illness? There's been 400 years of speculation.Hutchinson believes along with others including the surgeon Clifford Brewer's \\"The Death of Kings\\" (available at Amazon)that Henry did not have syphilis, but varicose ulcers on his legs. Both legs. Syphilis was treated in those days with mercury, and since hundreds of potions Henry was given by his doctors are recorded, mercury would most certainly have been administered. Also, none of Henry's wives or children showed any sign of congenital syphilis. Anyway, when the ulcers healed over,infections resulted underneath the skin, and very likely spread into the bones. The king's physical sufferings played a large role in shaping his behavior towards the end of his life.Here is one Hutchinson's descriptions of Henry's awful disease: \\"He is the personification of geriatric decay. One can almost smell the the putrid stench of the rank pus oozing from his ulcers, staining the bandages on his swollen legs. Chapuys [the Spanish ambassador] labelled them 'the worst legs in the world.'\\"Henry weighed, according to Hutchinson, 28 stone or 392 pounds. His waist was 54 inches around. Many suits of Henry's armor survive, so his physical proportions are easy to calculate. His gluttony contributed to his health problems, so his obesity and his ulcers did him in at age 55, and just before his death he lost the power of speech, finally sinking into a uremic coma.\\"The Last Days of Henry VIII\\" goes into great detail about the state of England towards the end of Henry's life, but my interests lie in character portrayal. Edward VI, Henry's only son, is described as a boy of unattractive \\"prissiness\\". The stupidity of Kathryn Howard, Henry's fifth wife, in cuckolding the king right under his nose, is discussed. Anne of Cleves emerges as \\"no fool, behind her pock-marked face\\". Interestingly, Anne and Henry's daughter, Mary, became fast friends. They died at the same age, 42, one year apart. The Duke of Norfolk emerges as a coward and hypocrite. The power behind the throne towards the end of Henry's life was Sir Anthony Denny, a man I had never heard of. Sir Anthony was Chief Gentleman of the Privy Chamber and controlled all access to the monarch and managed all of Henry's finances.The power behind the throne.All of these character studies, along with many more, are what interest me the most in the book.There's an especiially interesting plate in the book, in black and white, of Mary, painted in 1536 by Holbein when Mary was twenty years old. Mary looks like a woman of forty, her face shadowed with fatigue, her thin lips rigid and uncompromising. Facing the page of Mary is the superb portait of Elizabeth when she was 13. It's very odd, but Mary and ELizabeth facing eachother, look astoundingly alike even though Elizabeth is fresh-faced and young.In real life, the sisters did not resemble eachother and yet these two portraits, side by side, are food for thought. It's a bit eerie!The tangled web of conspiracies and heresies and treason are brought forth in the book to great effect, including character studies and influence of the clergymen Cranmer and Gardiner. Henry VIII was responsible for many burnings at the stake of people from all walks of life. As his illness became more incapacitating, the more ruthless Henry became so that in the end, he died a lonely old man with no friends. And horribly, it was rumored that Henry's immense coffin burst a seam and issued forth a stream of corrupted matter. A dog was caught trying to lap up the blood, like the dogs who lapped up the blood of Ahab. The story may be apocryphal, of course, but maybe not.To get a real gut feeling for the times of Henry VIII \\"The Last Days\\" is recommended."},{"Title":"The Last Days of Henry VIII : Conspiracies, Treason and Heresy at the Court of the Dying Tyrant","review":"I found Hutchinson's Last Days of Henry VIII to be well written and very readable. Anyone looking for a general overview of this part of Henry's life should be well pleased with the book. The depiction of Henry's dealings with his inner circle and of his funeral are perhaps the most detailed that I have read anywhere. I did feel, however, that the book failed to achieve five stars in that it didn't examine in any depth Henry's relationship with his surviving children - all of whom went on to rule England in their own right. It would have added much value to the book if the author had spent some time discussing how Henry's gargantuan personality shaped those of the rulers who came after him."},{"Title":"The Last Days of Henry VIII : Conspiracies, Treason and Heresy at the Court of the Dying Tyrant","review":"I commenced this book with the view that perhaps Henry VIII was no worse than your average black-hearted monarch of the Middle Ages; that view went up in smoke in the first 50 pages of this fascinating book. Hutchinson has researched well for this book and the bibliography is full of reference to primary documents and quotes at length from them.In some ways Henry was no worse than some of his scheming, ruthless and murderous Councilors and Government officials, but he bested them all with his acutely developed sense of low cunning, deviousness and intelligence. The book offers a brilliant cross section of the personalities and the dynamics of the rulers and some of the would-be rulers during the last years of Henry's reign.Henry was a very sick man for the last few years of his life and in great pain and this made him a very dangerous person to be around with his power of life and death over his subjects. His natural qualities of selfishness, ruthlessness and cruelty became even more pronounced as he sunk deeper into pain and ill health and edged towards death.Hutchinson gives a very good analysis of the effects in England of Henry VIII's break with the Roman Catholic Church and the consequences, some fatal, for his subjects as they tried to deal with the aftermath. The author gives a sad and heart breaking account of some of his executed victims, some are in their teens, some are poor and they all have no hope of a fair trial or hearing under Henry's despotic rule. This book is well worth reading, if only to see how far human rights have advanced; in some countries anyway!"},{"Title":"The Last Days of Henry VIII : Conspiracies, Treason and Heresy at the Court of the Dying Tyrant","review":"Henry VIII ruled his kingdom, at least towrd the end of his reign, with low political cunning, and a mixture of tyranny and terror. Even those closest to him at court could never be sure about the long-term stability of their positions. His mind was mercurial, and often changed by the last person with whom he spoke, but the final decision, good or bad, was always his. This is an extremely readable work that takes us through the last years of his life, when life around him became extremely bad, not only because of his natural inclination to incite terror, but the very real physical pain he sufered from various problems with his often abused body. This is a cautionary tale of how absolute power corrupts absolutely, and a fine addition to the lengthy volumes on the Tudors."},{"Title":"The Last Days of Henry VIII : Conspiracies, Treason and Heresy at the Court of the Dying Tyrant","review":"Robert Hutchinson's The Last Days of Henry VIII: Conspiracies, Treason and Heresy at the Court of the Dying Tyrant is something of a mixed bag. On the plus side, it does provide a number of valuable insights into the last years of Henry VIII's reign, particularly with regard to how truly dangerous life in his court was for those around him. Hutchinson draws on an abundance of research, drawing from many contemporary personal accounts so that we actually hear the opinions and observations of those who knew the man intimately (many, as it turned out, to their ultimate misfortune) in their own words:\\"It is now no novelty among us to see men slain, hung, drawn, quartered, beheaded. Some for trifling expressions, which were explained or interpreted as having been spoken against the king; others for the Pope's supremacy; some for one thing, some for another.\\"The book contains a number of detailed accounts of the intrigues and conspiracies that went on in Henry's court, and shows how Henry was in fact the master of the game, constantly keeping the factions in his court off-balance and frequently turning their own plots back on them in publicly humiliating ways. Two of the more telling episodes related deal with plots against Archbishop Thomas Cranmer:\\"No one was entirely safe from the devious intrigues at court. Almost certainly encouraged by Gardiner and Sir John Baker, some of the seven conservative canons of Canterbury Cathedral accused Cranmer himself of encouraging heretical sermons within the diocese of Canterbury in 1543. Their complaints and accusations were dispatched to the king. As Henry was rowed upriver on his royal barge one evening, he saw Cranmer standing outside the gates of his palace at Lambeth. The vessel pulled into the bank and the archbishop, coming aboard, was stunned by the king's light-hearted greeting: 'Ah, my chaplain! I have news for you. I know now who is the greatest heretic in Kent.' Henry then pulled the paper listing the accusations against Cranmer from his sleeve and showed it to him. The king liked Cranmer, perhaps was even fond of him, for his easy-going honesty, otherworldliness, compassion and total lack of personal ambition. With a neat sleight of hand, Henry appointed him to head the commission of inquiry into the accusations against himself. After lengthy deliberations, a general pardon was issue to all concerned.\\"And in the second plot against Cranmer two years later which Hutchinson lays out in great detail and then summarizes:\\"Henry's motivation in this tense little human drama remains unclear, if not downright Machiavellian. He had patently agreed to his archbishop's arrest, if not actively encouraging his enemies amonst the conservative faction. But Henry then proceeded to tip Cranmer off about his impending doom in a melodramatic late-night meeting [at which he gave him a royal ring to show his continued favor]. From that moment, in the empty corridor at Westminster, the archbishop was never in danger. Yet the king happily let the plot run its course before firmly and publicly stamping upon it. Humiliation plays an important part in the story - Henry teases his advisers about it: the humiliation of Cranmer, kept waiting amongst the common lackeys; the humiliation of his Privy Council accusers by the sudden production of the life-saving king's ring mere moments before the planned arrest; the humiliation caused by Henry's rebuke. That flourish by Cranmer in holding up the royal ring, immediately showed Gardiner, Norfolk and the rest of his enemies that the game was up and that they had been outmaneuvered. And that must have been Henry's intention all along. His aim, this time, was to mortify the conservative faction as part of his delicate balancing act in the difficult area of developing religious policy. The constant conspiracies and divisions amongst his councillors must also have exasperated him, as did similar contrversy amongst his subjects.\\"The book also goes into many of the aspects of Henry's last years, including a fairly detailed history of the king's many injuries and ailments (\\"he has the worst legs in the world\\" according to the Spanish ambassador at the court at the time) that in all likelihood contributed to his often foul disposition and his frequent rages. Hutchinson also includes several illustrations of portraits done of many of the key personages of Henry's court, including some very illuminating ones of Henry at different stages of his life that show more clearly than mere words a king going from his prime into decline.\\"Thus we have before us the image of a remorselessly cruel monarch, totally ruthless in his hold on the reins of power; careless of the lives of his friends and subjects; always determined to get his own way; and rapacious in the accumulation of wealth, almost always at the expense of others. He was a psychotic, paranoid bully, perilously enjoying absolute authority. But if he did suffer from Cushing's syndrome, perhaps somewhere even in the coldest of hearts we may find a few shreds of sympathy for the old ogre.\\"On the minus side, however, is that the first two thirds of the book tend to jump around quite a bit chronologically, making it difficult to follow. That portion of the book in particular could have been much better organized and presented to give the reader a more focused and coherent picture of what led up to the last few years and how the myriad dramas of those last few years unfolded.I would recommend this book as a good resource on the subject, but more to be viewed as a good resource than necessarily a good read."},{"Title":"The Last Days of Henry VIII : Conspiracies, Treason and Heresy at the Court of the Dying Tyrant","review":"Henry VIII's story does not end with the beheading of Anne Boleyn. Hutchinson pulls from many sources of Henry VIII's contemporaries to tell the most interesting bits of Henry's last few years as King of England. The chapters do not follow a consecutive timeline, but rather skip around and focus on a single theme such as reforming the church, the ordeal surrounding the king's marriage to Anne of Cleves, the war waged with France, Henry's health, etc.I found this book very easy to read for a number of reasons. Hutchinson continually reminds the reader of certain characters and their relations/roles to King Henry VIII. If you still can't figure out who someone is, simply flip to the back of the book and there's a whole list of names and a short one or two line \\"biography\\" on each person. There's also a timeline in case the flipping back and forth between years gets confusing. I didn't have any problems following along and I'm not well versed on Tudor history! In fact, this is the first historical biography I have ever read! And I read it for pure enjoyment!So, if you're looking for an interesting book on one of the more interesting characters of the English monarchy, I highly recommend you consider this book!"},{"Title":"The Last Days of Henry VIII : Conspiracies, Treason and Heresy at the Court of the Dying Tyrant","review":"The obese, disease ridden old man, rarely seen by the public, a man with an evil heart and a foul mouth and temper bore no resemblance to the athletic good looking young buck who had taken the throne of England 35 years previously.The young Henry was a sportsman of some renown and his vibrant personality and good looks attracted many beautiful women. The old Henry was fat, dirty, riddled with disease and took most of his pleasure from watching other people suffer, including those closest to him.Robert Hutchinson's book on the final years of Henry's life, brings forth many startling revelations of the intrigues, plot and counter plot of the time. He has unearthed death warrants, confessions, pleas for clemency and many other, until now, little documented facts.I enjoyed the book immensely, but it was tinged with sadness for me. Henry VIII might (who can say) have been one of the greatest King's England has ever had. But like so many great men he had the fatal flaw in his make-up, which eventually makes them press the self destruct button."},{"Title":"The Last Days of Henry VIII : Conspiracies, Treason and Heresy at the Court of the Dying Tyrant","review":"The Last Days of Henry VIII was recommended to me by a friend with whom I have had many informative discussions about Tudor England, one of the most fascinating periods in Western History, and in particular, the court of King Henry, the eighth of that name.Hutchinson starts with the first part of Henry's reign in order to set the background for the events that were to follow. It is the last period, during his final marriage and the French war, that he goes into greatest detail-- and welcome detail it is. A great deal of ink has been spilt over Henry's earlier life, particularly his marriages to Catherine of Aragon and Anne Boleyn-- indeed, entire single volumes have been devoted to them. Most histories of Henry's reign go into greatest detail over his first three wives, giving rather short shrift to the final three. In the cases of Anna Klewes and Katherine Howard, this might be forgiven as both marriages were short-lived (6 months and just about 2 years, respectively) and their ends very public. But his marriage to Catherine Parr, who ultimately became the only woman to survive the Royal Marriage Bed, has also been gone over lightly, mention most often being given to her Reformation beliefs, her skilled management of the affairs of state during Henry's absence to fight in France, and her negotiations to restore the positions of the Princesses Mary and Elizabeth. Hutchinson certainly he pays attention to those extremely important points, but he also takes us much further behind the scenes: Far from being a placid, ideal wife. companion and family administrator to an aging monarch, Catherine is shown to be a woman of great intellect, passion, and perhaps most interestingly, a woman who spent more than a fair share of time in fear of her well-being, if not her life. Fortunately for her, she had already been married to two older, sickly men, and knew well how to manage such a husband, and also had the examples of 5 previous failed wives to learn from. And she learnt well.Henry's decline into paranoid, mean and capricious old age are also well documented. The \\"medical treatments\\" (quotes deliberate) he received for his numerous ailments, particularly his legs, were barbaric and it's hard to believe any reasonable person thought they would be in th e least effective, and reading Hutchinson's careful documentation of Henry's decline in health, one is forced to wonder: If the King had access to aspirin and antibiotics, how much milder might he have been? Instead he wages unnecessary and foolish war, tortured and burned dozens of perceived heretics, then did a complete about face and adopted their beliefs into his official state religion, bankrupted his country, and upon his death, far from leaving a certain strong heir, left the country in a turmoil it would not emerge from completely until his second daughter, Elizabeth (whom he swore would never sit on his throne), took the reigns of power, some dozen years later.One senses some bias in the book, but it does not overwhelm the facts (as can often happen in a history book), and one comes away from the book with a clearer picture of the real importance of this last period of Henry's life, and how it would affect England for some time to come after he departed this mortal coil."},{"Title":"The Last Days of Henry VIII : Conspiracies, Treason and Heresy at the Court of the Dying Tyrant","review":"British scholar and Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries Robert Hutchinson offers up an eminently readable look at the horrifying, grotesque atmosphere of the court of Henry VIII during the years following the execution of Thomas Cromwell (1540). The King who is probably the single most famous and often depicted monarch in English history had, by the 1540s, degenerated from an athletic, flamboyant king to a morbidly obese tyrant who struck terror into the hearts of even the most arrogant and jaded courtiers. During the final five years of his reign, the competent government that had operated effectively under such skilled managers as Wolsey and Cromwell, fell after their deaths into near bankruptcy with severe devaluation of coinage caused by rampant overspending on failed wars and internal corruption. Henry handed out rewards and murderous punishments as courtiers worked with nervous anticipation to establish their positions when the bloated, sick and increasingly unpredictable king should finally die. When he finally did die at age 55 in January 1547, Henry VIII was succeeded by his son, nine year old Edward VI and the winning factions claimed elaborate titles and rewards while others were dispatched to the Tower. During this time, the English Reformation hovered between extreme visions of reform and reaction with some of the most horrific tortures and burnings designed to \\"save the souls\\" of the people and their dying monarch. Many of the winners of this deadly sweepstakes of greed and religious fanaticism ended up beheaded or burned as the wheel of fortune continued to turn murderously through the reigns of Edward VI (1547-53) and Mary Tudor (\\"Bloody Mary\\" 1553-1558) to the accession of Elizabeth I in November 1558.This history book is anything but dry and uninteresting. Readers of Hillary Mantel's trilogy will certainly want to check this out. It casts clear and precise light on the fear and mismanagement that prevailed during the final years of Henry VIII. One doesn't generally think of Henry VIII as incompetent, but this book brings into clear focus how the physical and mental deterioration of an absolute monarch can create a massive governmental \\"train wreck\\" as underlings motivated by greed and fear scramble to rescue themselves."},{"Title":"The Last Days of Henry VIII : Conspiracies, Treason and Heresy at the Court of the Dying Tyrant","review":"This book was extremely disappointing, especially for a person well read in Tudor History. The title is very misleading. I thought this book would examine in depth the final years of Henry's reign. Theses final years were full of scandal, intrigue and death but the book read like a summary of his whole reign. There are plenty of other books that do this and do it better (Alison Weir for example). It's pages and pages of he said, she said quotes followed by summaries of crucial events that surely deserve more description. If you are looking for a thorough historical analysis of the final years of Henry, save your money."},{"Title":"The Last Days of Henry VIII : Conspiracies, Treason and Heresy at the Court of the Dying Tyrant","review":"This book is a great comprehensive look at the last few years of Henry VIII's life, which is often overlooked due to the scandals of his earlier years. It explores in depth his last three marriages, the conspiracies and rivalries abounding in his inner circle, the religious climate, his volatile temper, his waning heath and final illness, and his majestic funeral. We see some familiar characters like Cromwell exit the scene in Henry's familiar tyrant fashion, and we become more familiar with others who filled large rolls behind the scene. I would recommend this as a great supplement to the collection of any Tudor enthusiast as a readable and straightforward account of Henry's final, tumultuous years."},{"Title":"The Last Days of Henry VIII : Conspiracies, Treason and Heresy at the Court of the Dying Tyrant","review":"This book--historically accurate, intriguing, and a real knuckle-biter for aficiandos of Henry VIII's fascinating time on this earth--would be perfect if written by a historian who was capable of retelling historical facts in a unique and literary fashion without clouding every paragraph and sometimes every sentence with his own prejudices and scorn. Why write a book about someone you simply can't stop from disparaging at every turn? Henry VIII is poorly judged by present day standards and his accomplishments are meagerly recounted; the author is too quick to point out the dire repurcussions of every move and slow to donate any charitable interpretations of the ruler's many accomplishments. This book could truly have been a great jaunt were it not for the writer's heavy hand and inability to keep his personal feelings out of his way. Fans of Henry will hate it---a shame because it's replete with little-known asides and shadowy counter-plots otherwise missed by most accounts of this great king's life."},{"Title":"The Last Days of Henry VIII : Conspiracies, Treason and Heresy at the Court of the Dying Tyrant","review":"I have been a fan of anything Henry VIII since I was a teenager and this book was a very satisfying read."},{"Title":"The Last Days of Henry VIII : Conspiracies, Treason and Heresy at the Court of the Dying Tyrant","review":"This book does a remarkably good job of presenting the facts about the final years of Henry VIII, a time when political and religious factions were vying for control over the course England would take after Henry's imminent death. I've read a lot about Henry over the years but this book taught me many things about him that I never knew before. This book contains an overview of the political and religious situation towards the end of Henry's time and also presents many interesting new findings and details you probably won't read anywhere else. It's written in an erudite yet relaxed style that is easy, even entertaining to read, and feels like listening to a lecture by a skilled history professor with a sense of humor. This book is a valuable and very welcome recent addition to the world's historical knowledge of Henry's time.

This is true even of most books which overview bear natural history and ecology. There are three reasons. First, &quot;Scare&quot; is what sells. Second, no writer wants to &quot;lead&quot; a reader to attempt something dangerous. Third, scientists who study bears typically spend a lot more time dealing with bears in traps, where the animals are frightened and defensive, than with free-ranging bears. The bear's fear and the biologist's fear combine to give biologists the perception that the bears are highly aggressive and dangerous. In fact, whoofing, huffing, jaw popping, ground slapping and other threat displays are more manifestations of fear than aggression. So one's safety lies more in calming the bear than in trying to intimidate it -- contrary to common &quot;wisdom.&quot; These insights grew out of getting to know bears personally, one on one; by winning their trust so that one could spend hours or days with them in the wild. This was first done on a hit-and-miss basis with Alaska Peninsula brown/grizzly bears by Fish &amp; Game biologist Jim Faro, and then by a series of grad students from Utah State University, working at McNeil Falls: Derek Stonorov, Al Egbert, Mike Luque and Tom Bledsoe. Alaska Fish &amp; Game biologist Larry Aumiller was hired by Faro to guide visitors to safely watch bears at McNeil, a responsibility at which Aumiller has excelled for roughly 20 years. (Tim Treadwell's &quot;observations&quot; from the same general region -- Among Grizzlies -- are entertaining though not entirely accurate) My own research on free ranging Alaska grizzly and black bears date back to 1972. Yet, it was Lynn Rogers and his assistant Greg Wilker who really refined &quot;walking with bears&quot; to gather highly detailed data on behavior and life history. Now, Rogers' protege, Terry Debryun has carried the research in several new directions, particuarly in the study of scent marking.Debryun's experiences constitute the most detailed and engaging scientific portrait of the secret life of individual bears ever published. Readers can follow Debryun's experiences with sows Nettie and Carmen and their cubs over the course of a year, supplemented with flashbacks to earlier years. For those interested in knowing black bears as they really are, as individual personalities, this book is without peer.What countless people have dreamed of doing, Debryun has actually done. This is a fine read which I recommend highly."},{"Title":"Walking with Bears: One Man's Relationship with Three Generations of Wild Bears","review":"If you're at all interested in the natural world around us, and concerned about how much we take for granted in this day and age, this is a sobering and fascinating look at black bears. The author tracks the lives of a family of bears (mainly 3 generations worth) over the course of a year to discuss their behaviors and their seasonal variation. Almost as a by product of this you learn a lot about bears, and the actions and motivations of potentially dangerous wild animals as a whole. I feel a lot safer being outdoors having read some of the explanations for the motivations of aggressive behavior, especially towards humans. I would say more about the book itself but I think it is best left as a surprise. Suffice it to say if you've wondered about bears or the upbringing of offspring in animals, this is a superb book. It's my first book on bears so there may be some others out there which others would suggest first, but I don't see how one could go wrong with this one."},{"Title":"Walking with Bears: One Man's Relationship with Three Generations of Wild Bears","review":"I have scoured high and low to enjoy the information that only biologists from the field can share about the intimate lives of animals.

Can you read this book, and come away not wanting to act to protect these creatures? Many books are thought-provoking. This one made me feel that I need to ACT. DeBruyn's diary-style writings make it possible to appreciate the necessity of wisely sharing the habitat with the native residents, not depriving them of it. The author's data and observations also dispell many myths about black bear behavior. If we can accept the truth, can we then act as responsible stewards of our world?"},{"Title":"Walking with Bears: One Man's Relationship with Three Generations of Wild Bears","review":"This is an excellent read that I highly recommend to any animal lover or for the individual who has ever had doubts that any animal lacks human feelings and responses.Not only is it a great scientific read about the biology and habits of bears, but also takes the whole experience to a higher level.

Morals and Dogma is brilliant scholarship which is so esoteric that it's nearly useless. (Exception: Explaining the Scottish Rite doctrine rejecting temporal and religious tyranny in the 30th degree, Knight Kadosh.) Pike writes with unexplained Latin and Greek passages, and strange references to Egyptian mythology. (He later explained that he used Egyptian examples because he figured that wouldn't offend any of the modern religions.)If you're looking to learn about Freemasonry, this ain't the book for you. In fact, no book will tell you very much about Freemasonry. I could write about skydiving, describe the rush of the air into the plane, the hesitation stepping out, the freedom of free-fall, and so forth, but unless I've done it, I have no way to REALLY understand it. If you want to understand it, you really have to go through the experience. To be a Mason, ask a Mason.RC"},{"Title":"Morals and Dogma of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of Freemasonry","review":"After spending six years in Iraq with numerous Masons from various lodges, albeit mostly Prince Hall and Blue lodge masons(many I consider brothers for other reasons), I can tell you the truth is somewhere in-between both sides of this debate. If one can truly put away their own bias on this subject, they will find enough legitimate evidence to support 'some' of the alleged bad things and good things that occur in many lodges. Note that a much greater number of US Government, Military, and Law Enforcement personnel are Freemasons than you would ever imagine. Think of them as protectors, or gatekeepers.Before I discovered how many of my friends and associates were Masons while working for the DoD in Iraq, my preconceived notion was that they were probably satanists, or followers of the occult. Although, some of the concepts, rituals, etc. might technically be occult, the majority of the Masons I know are not bad, or evil. Most of the masons I lived, worked and risked my life with were of the highest quality character, had the best work ethic, and were the most selfless people, just as our masonic founding fathers.(i.e. George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, etc) However, here goes the sad, but true part..When others resort to blanket stereotypes and ignorant generalizations about Freemasons, they are being sidetracked. The REAL problem is the protective Masonic structure itself imbues masons (both Good and Bad) with the \\"potential\\" to become dangerous threats to humanity. I am NOT speaking of what I 'think' or 'feel', rather what I have witnessed myself in an environment much like the movie, Beyond the Thunderdome (power struggles in a war torn country). I have seen many good masonic people enable, support, and protect a few filthy ones who have done more harm to their brotherhood than anyone on the outside. Some of the most detestable things I saw over there came from power hungry masons who constantly exploited the masonic system in order serve their own interests, or evade the law.I do not believe what I repeatedly saw from the self-serving ones were isolated incidents, but more like a microcosm of what happens elsewhere, including back home.You might think, \\"Well, who the hell cares?\\". That would be the wrong question.Now think about where this might apply in a society full of Waste, Fraud, and Abuse; Corruption. What about the most powerful politicians who keep screwing Americans, but can't ever seem to be voted out of office? Consider the one bad cop on the squad who 'unnecessarily' kills an innocent youth (i.e. trigger happy), but never sees jail time? And how about the CEO of a large bank who somehow manages to convince the Treasury to allow the transfer of toxic debt from their balance sheet onto the backs of the public, sticking it to the average citizen struggling to pay the rent? What about that time a company starts laying employees off, but the new guy who doesn't even know his stuff yet, still keeps his job? Yeah, it is predominately because of 'who they know' and the fact that Masons will not turn on each other, even if they have one sorry excuse for a piece of crap brother whose a murderer. What was once a powerful force for good and freedom early in American history has quite simply been corrupted and exploited.Don't get me wrong, I very much revere General Patton, Eisenhower, and MacArthur as I borrow quotes from them all the time. Unfortunately, the world is so messed up right now, these wolves I previously spoke about are licking their chops once they get in, as they are fully aware of the level of benefits, protection, and more influential connections they will make. Every time I asked one of the new guys why they were joining, it was always a selfish response. \\"I'd like to have a political career someday.\\" or \\"I need a hookup.\\" (trying to get a better job)While working for Centcom, I can tell you the majority of Freemasons I knew were a step above the rest of us. But I cannot emphasize enough that some of the most corrupt, filthy, dangerous, thieving scumbags out there also wore the same robe. For much of the criminally inclined savages on earth, they will eventually face the law and justice will be served. But, there's a good chance that same criminal who wears a robe will be placed above the law. Depending on the circumstances and personality of the individual this can empower an ordinary criminal (including a thief) to be a VERY dangerous one. Quite frankly, there doesn't seem to be enough checks and balances, or rather they simply don't work too well since the tight-knit brotherhood can effectively result in a 'no snitch' policy.The adequate response from all Freemasons should be reflective in nature, to determine just how to make this right, restore what has been lost and prevent the great potential for tyranny, injustice, and further inequality.Another reason I had to comment, I really got tired of seeing folks bash some of my friends without even knowing any of them. Trust me, they're not sorcerers. Basically, there's a whole lot of good people doing great work, spending lots of time helping charities and who die regularly for our country, but there's a few rotten apples destroying anything good still left in the system.Just in case you're wondering, because of the aforementioned character issues of a \`few' really shady masons, AND because of my personal religious beliefs I will likely never join Freemasonry.I'd also like to consider this a plea for the Masonic leadership take this issue seriously, before it's too late. It may sound crazy, but the balance of power, future of humanity might very well depend on it. Just look around. Freemasons are just as much responsible for shaping the world today as they were way back then during early Colonial days. If the leadership hasn't even started to clean things up yet, it may be a sign it's time for all Freemasons to start shaking things up."},{"Title":"Morals and Dogma of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of Freemasonry","review":"Listen,Pike was a sick man, I think most of us know that. But his literary works are vital information he left behind to teach us something about the way life is for us and why it's that way. So he wasn't all bad, and he left behind something that can help those who want to do better.Even the enemy can teach us all something meaningful and I consider his book to be a must read for all humans. It doesn't explain why he was sick, because it appears that he didn't know he was out of it, but it indeed sheds light into the adverse human condition worldwide and exposes how people don't mind being bent over by men, and for that explicit reason, men bend people over."},{"Title":"Morals and Dogma of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of Freemasonry","review":"I bought this book because I have just read the highly recommendable novel 'Journey to Eden' by Max Pucher. It is full of references to Freemasonry and I am astonished that so much of it seems to be true and not just creative invention. 'Morals and Dogma' is quite a surprise. I guess that most see Masonry as purely a charitable concept like me, but that is not all when you read what the founder of the Scottish Rite has to say in here. I wonder how much this is truly related to America's founders.This book is interesting but not a great read, by the way."},{"Title":"Morals and Dogma of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of Freemasonry","review":"Albert Pike, an American General who had been enticed into the Illuminati by Guiseppe Mazzini, completed his military blueprint for three worldwars and various revolutions throughout the world in 1871, culminating into moving thisgreat conspiracy into its final stage. These details are as follows:The First World War is to be fought for the purpose of destroying the Tsar inRussia, as promised by Nathan Mayer Rothschild in 1815. The Tsar is to bereplaced with communism which is to be used to attack religions,predominantly Christianity. The differences between the British and Germanempires are to be used to foment this war.The Second World War is to be used to foment the controversy betweenfascism and political Zionism with the oppression of Jews in Germany alynchpin in bringing hatred against the German people. This is designed todestroy fascism (which the Rothschilds created) and increase the power ofpolitical Zionism. This war is also designed to increase the power ofcommunism to the level that it equalled that of united Christendom.The Third World War is to be played out by stirring up hatred of the Muslimworld for the purposes of playing the Islamic world and the political Zionistsoff against one another. Whilst this is going on, the remaining nations wouldbe forced to fight themselves into a state of mental, physical, spiritual andeconomic exhaustion.On August 15th of this year, Albert Pike writes a letter (now catalogued in the British Museum) to Guiseppe Mazzini in which he states the following,We shall unleash the nihilists and the atheists and we shall provoke a great social cataclysm which in all its horror will show clearly to all nations the effect of absolute atheism; the origins of savagery and of most bloody turmoil.Then everywhere, the people will be forced to defend themselves against the world minority of the world revolutionaries and will exterminate those destroyers of civilization and the multitudes disillusioned with Christianity whose spirits will be from that moment without direction and leadership and anxious for an ideal, but without knowledge where to send its adoration, will receive the true light through the universal manifestation of the pure doctrine of Lucifer brought finally out into public view.A manifestation which will result from a general reactionary movement which will follow the destruction of Christianity and Atheism; both conquered and exterminated at the same time.Pike, who had been elected as Sovereign Grand Commander of the Scottish Rite of Freemasonrys Southern Jurisdiction in 1859, was the most powerful Freemason in America. He would retain that post for thirty-two years until his death in 1891. He also published this book, Morals and Dogma of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of Freemasonry in which he candidly states the following,\\"The true name of Satan, the Kabbalists say, is that of Yahweh reversed; for Satan is not a black god, but the negation of God...For the Initiates, this is not a Person, but a Force, created for good, but which may serve for evil. It is the instrument of Liberty and Free Will...LUCIFER, the Light-bearer! Strange and mysterious name to give to the Spirit of Darkness! Lucifer, the Son of the Morning! Is it he who bears the Light, and with its splendors intolerable blinds feeble, sensual or selfish Souls? Doubt it not!\\"Interestingly, in the same book, Pike emphasizes that Freemasonry is a religion based on the occult Jewishphilosophy found in the Kabbalah."},{"Title":"Morals and Dogma of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of Freemasonry","review":"do you realize how dangerous it is for u to sell this book Know one is going to by it because of its history and the very well known fact that NO ONE WHO HAS THIS BOOK IS SUPPOSESED TO TALK ABOUT IT LIT ALONE SELL IT..SO PEOPLE WILL FIRST ASSUME IT IS WITH OUT A DOUBT FAKE,AND THEN AND ONLY THEN WILL PEOPLE BELIVE U ARE A CRAZED MEMBER OF THE FREEMASONS AND OR TRYING MAKE A PROFIT ON THERE SCARED BOOK OF DOGMA AND RITULS WHICH IS STRICLY FORRBIDDEN AS I HAVE ALREADY STATED DO YOUR SELF A FAVOR AND TAKE IT DOWN.....Be Well.............."},{"Title":"Morals and Dogma of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of Freemasonry","review":"Morals and Dogma by Albert Pike no longer has the prominence among Scottish Rite Masons as it once held. Most likely because the majority of people it was presented to throughout the years never bothered to read it, but possibly because it is such a daunting task to try and understand what he is referring to. I usually finish a book of 900 pages in about 4 days; I've been reading this book since Thanksgiving, four months for roughly 865 pages. It's not that Pike writes above the head of any reader, it's just if you want to be thorough when your reading something as reflective as Morals and Dogma, it's good to cross reference many of the works alluded to by the author and tries to get a broader understanding of what he is talking about. I'll go ahead and make the standard disclaimer here, this book has nothing to do with establishing a religious creed for anyone reading it, and it is not the book I would recommend for the beginner who is researching Masonic lore. What Pike does, and in a masterful way, is take each of the 32 degrees of the Scottish Rite, and lifts the veils (reveals) of the allegories hidden behind each of the ceremonies (ritual is more correct, but it denotes too many ties with religion in our current lexicon). Each chapter is a degree of the Scottish Rite, and each one attempts to show the reader where the symbolism originally came from, and then cross references it with all of the religious and philosophical systems that had existed at the time of its writing. From the Kabala to the early orders of Knighthood, each piece of symbolism that Masonry had required is broken down and analyzed in the most painstaking manner, leaving the reader to decide if the symbolism holds any weight within his own moral or dogmatic code, just like the actual degree work that is performed during the various stages of initiation. Pike never said, \\"You must believe in all of these religions in order to be a good Mason,\\" and even went so far as to proclaim Christianity as the most likely candidate for the one true legacy of all the early religions stemming back to the origin of the human race's belief systems as we know it. If people want to denounce the various moral codes of other belief systems, then they are free to do so, but I do think they should review the books that proclaim those codes, and not one that merely compares the various aspects of said religions so that the reader can come to an appreciation of all the various \\"morals and dogmas\\" represented. I think this is a fine work for anyone interested in comparative religion, or just wants to see that man from one background is not so much different in his beliefs from another, and that very likely they had a common root. This should also still be required reading for anyone interested in truly appreciating their Masonic heritage and wants to delve deeper than just putting on the regalia and performing the scripts."},{"Title":"Morals and Dogma of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of Freemasonry","review":"What is the philosophy inculcated by the Masonic Fraternity?

Recommended to everyone who is interested in philosophy and comparative religion, but more especially to the Mason who desires a more thorough understanding of his fraternity."},{"Title":"Morals and Dogma of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of Freemasonry","review":"I first looked Albert Pike up on the Internet, because my friend, Andrew, told me that as the founder of the Ku Klux Klan, he was the most evil American. Many sources claim that Pike espoused slavery in 1857 while practicing law in Arkansas. And it's easy to find references to him all over the Internet saying that he worshipped Lucifer and had demonic intentions of bringing the world under the totalitarian control of the Illuminati in an apocalyptic Third World War; that he could even see far enough ahead to help engineer the modern conflict between the West and Islam and so on and so forth.He's born and raised in Boston, considered a Founding Father. And prior to the Civil War he was firmly against secession, but he nonetheless joined the Confederate Army and was put in charge of working with the Indians, because he got along with them so well. And then he did a terrible job as a General and was even arrested on counts of insubordination and treason. And he's the only Confederate soldier who has a statue in Washington. Hmmm...Of course, in past times, I wouldn't have been allowed to read his book, not only because I'm not an Nth degree Freemason, but because I'm just a girl. So, of course, I bought the book about a year ago, and I've been reading it slowly every evening, and then rereading passages that I felt didn't quite sink in.Every page is infused with such heart, and such depth of wisdom and such erudition.And there's just no way the author of this book sought the downfall of Christianity or Islam or Buddhism or any other religion. And there's no way he regarded other races and peoples as inferior... you don't write 850 pages quoting extensively and respectfully from the best writings of the Western and Eastern and African traditions if you think they are in some way inferior to your own. And he didn't believe in slavery. I could quote 1000 passages (without exaggeration) which are irreconcilable with a belief in any of this, but let me pull out a few here... Hmmm... Lessee...*********************\\"Christianity taught the doctrine of Fraternity; but repudiated that of political Equality... Masonry was the first apostle of Equality. In the monastery there is Fraternity and Equality, but no Liberty. Masonry added that also, and claimed for man a three-fold heritage, Liberty, Equality and Fraternity... Man has a natural empire over all institutions. This seems a simple truth... But once it was a great new Truth... Once revealed, it imposed new duties on men. Man owed it to himself to be free. He owed it to his country to seek to giver her freedom, or to maintain her in that possession. It made Tyranny and Usurpation the enemies of the Human Race. It created a general outlawry of Despots and Depotisms, temporal and spiritual... Patriotism had, henceforth, a new and wider meaning. Free Government, Free Thought, Free Conscience, Free Speech! All these came to be inalienable rights, which those who had parted with them or been robbed of them, or whose ancestors had lost them, had the right summarily to retake.\\"\\"Masonry teaches that all power is delegated for the good, and not for the injury of the People; and that, when it is perverted from the original purpose, the compact is broken and the right ought to be resumed; that resistance to power usurped is not merely a duty which man owes to himself and his neighbor, but a duty which he owes to his God... This principle neither the rudeness of ignorance can stifle nor the enervation of refinement extinguish... The wise Mason will not fail to be a votary of Liberty and Justice.\\"\\"He has already lived too long who has survived the ruin of his country; and he who can enjoy life after such an event deserves not to have lived at all. Nor does he any more deserve to live who looks contentedly upon abuses that disgrace and cruelties that dishonor, and scenes of misery and destitution and brutalization that disfigure his country.\\"\\"Observing the annual return of the rising of the Nile was always accompanied by the appearance of a beautiful Star... The Ethiopian compared this act of that Star to that of the Animal, which barking gives warning of danger and styled it the Dog (Sirius).\\"\\"We do not undervalue the importance of any Truth. We utter no word that can be deemed irreverent by any one of any faith. We do not tell the Moslem that it is only important for him to believe that there is but one God and wholly unessential whether Mahomet was his prophet... And as little do we tell the sincere Christian that Jesus of Nazereth was a man like us, or His history but the unreal revival of an older legend. To do either is beyond our jurisdiction. Masonry, of no one age, belongs to all time; of no one religion, it finds its great truths in all.\\"\\"Thus Masonry disbelieves no truth and teaches unbelief in no creed... It draws no sword to compel others to adopt its belief.\\"\\"And be Charitable as God is, toward the unfaith, the errors, the follies, and the faults of men: for all make one great brotherhood.\\"\\"The immutable law of God requires, that besides respecting the absolute rights of others, and being merely just, we should do good, be charitable, and obey the dictates of the generous and noble sentiments of the soul. Charity is law, because our conscience is not satisfied nor at ease if we have not relieved the suffering, the distressed and the destitute.\\"********************I mean, c'mon guys.

Morals and Dogma is by no means, your typical Freemason's monitor. It is a Freemason's cardinal esoteric challenge--an erudite gauntlet for those who truly endeavor to be ambassadors of the institution. It is not something to be merely read; it's something to be lived! Its lessons are not intended to be fully comprehended by the intellect, but by the heart; the veritable object of Masonic instruction. (If you can stand it, read and devote deep contemplation to what Pike writes about Force and Intellect in the book.) And any Freemason with a heart will surely embrace the palpitant moral plasma the book's lessons will cause to course throughout his entire being.To pike's credit and literary genius, Morals and Dogma, ironically, often provokes a posture of deference in even non-masons (called the profane by Freemasons, for having never cast a shadow in a lodge). And as expected, it provokes a similarity in Freemasons because it is preceded by its reputation worldwide. So often do Freemason and profane alike obtain a copy of the book only to glean the first ten pages, maybe, and then rest it on the shelf to collect dust, or place it in the sitting room as a centerpiece, where it does the same. And they'll boast about their copy to audiences who don't really care (or know to) one way or another.This is not an easy read. In fact, it is a difficult one. Not for everybody.I'm not kidding, when I say that this book is a Freemason's convention in parchment, a marvelous aggregate of the world's finest teachers on pure morality in one tome. The \\"philosophies\\" of all the great classical masters from Hermes and Quetzalcoatl, to Buddha and Zoroaster, to Christ and Muhammad, etc., are eloquently canonized here. And I am of the firm opinion that Albert Pike intended this work to smudge the illusionary lines between the ancient system of moral philosophy and contemporary Freemasonic philosophy, and thereby, supplement the sacred mores he developed in his revision of the Scottish Rite ritual.Morals and Dogma is no mere book; it is a beast of books. And beasts must be conquered for heroes to emerge. Albert Pike was well versed in mythology, and he knew what he was doing when he penned this one! To be sure, there won't be another; this is the one.And finally, a direct salute to the man: Not only was Albert Pike a physical giant in his day (standing nearly six-five and weighing over three hundred pounds), but more significantly, he was a literary and moral giant as well. And he is still a giant today, for after all; his work still towers above the rest."},{"Title":"Morals and Dogma of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of Freemasonry","review":"This is one heavy brick of a book! From page one Albert Pike leads us through the 33 degrees of The Ancient and Scottish Rite, theoretically. The rituals themselves are not described, the book functions as a sort of theory injection to the rituals. \\"Morals and Dogma\\" is the Magnum Opus of Albert Pike, written exclusively for Scottish Rite masons, but other mason will enjoy this book too, I would say that anyone with any interest in history, philosophy, ethics and esotericism will find this extremely helpful.Albert Pike shows through this book how Freemasonry consists of several religions, not only one. He takes us through the similiarities in all religions, and tries to find the true essence in all of them. This will be helpful for christian masons who think that Freemasonry only is about Jesus and Hiram Abiff. Pike shows us that the Order has a lot of its history and symbolism from Zoroaster and the Indo Aryans, worshippers of Fire and Light.From the ethical, simple working tools of the Blue Lodge, to the christian ethics and mysticism of the Chapter of Rosy Cross, to the Aryan and Parsee worshipping of Light, which the Templars continued from the essenees and the Zoroastrians, this books leads the reader through darkness and light, laughter and bafflement, to education and deep thought, dicipline.A non-mason will also enjoy this book, filled with speculations and facts about the religions that affect the world so much. I recommend this book so much and whole heartedly that I am out of words now. Enjoy .:.K"},{"Title":"Morals and Dogma of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of Freemasonry","review":"Albert Pike's Morals & Dogma is a masterful introduction to comparative religion and philosophy. It is largely a compilation, drawing upon numerous authors of the past. While the flow of the text is criticized by some, I would point out that Pike's ability to weave a coherent and consistent text from the quotes of a large number of notable philosophers, religionists and writers is a significant feat.Pike chose to keep these individuals anonymous in this compilation not as an act of plagiarism, but because he felt it very important that readers engage the ideas presented on their own merits (or lack thereof), rather than accepting or discarding ideas because of who authored them. No idea in Morals and Dogma is intended to be accepted . . . well . . . dogmatically. Rather, Pike's purpose is to present ideas which are worthy of consideration, and to cause readers to exercise the minds over what is presented. The result is hopefully greater understanding and tolerance of differing systems of belief.Pike's method has led to some misunderstanding as to how to read the text, and how specific concepts relate to Freemasonry. I will not answer that issue here, but will suggest that the content of Morals & Dogma is indeed worthy of the thoughtful consideration of any educated adult. I highly recommend it.Then why a one-star rating? Because the specific Kindle edition I am reviewing has no linked table of content, is poorly formatted, and contains none of the illustrations of the original. These illustrations are sometimes critical for understanding the text, and it is a serious oversight to fail to include them in a Kindle edition of this Masonic classic.My suggestion?

Most of the masons I lived, worked and risked my life with were of the highest quality character, had the best work ethic, and were the most selfless people, just as our masonic founding fathers.(i.e. George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, etc) However, here goes the sad, but true part..When others resort to blanket stereotypes and ignorant generalizations about Freemasons, they are being sidetracked. The REAL problem is the protective Masonic structure itself imbues masons (both Good and Bad) with the \\"potential\\" to become dangerous threats to humanity. I am NOT speaking of what I 'think' or 'feel', rather what I have witnessed myself in an environment much like the movie, Beyond the Thunderdome (power struggles in a war torn country). I have seen many good masonic people enable, support, and protect a few filthy ones who have done more harm to their brotherhood than anyone on the outside. Some of the most detestable things I saw over there came from power hungry masons who constantly exploited the masonic system in order serve their own interests, or evade the law.I do not believe what I repeatedly saw from the self-serving ones were isolated incidents, but more like a microcosm of what happens elsewhere, including back home.You might think, \\"Well, who the hell cares?\\". That would be the wrong question.Now think about where this might apply in a society full of Waste, Fraud, and Abuse; Corruption. What about the most powerful politicians who keep screwing Americans, but can't ever seem to be voted out of office? Consider the one bad cop on the squad who 'unnecessarily' kills an innocent youth (i.e. trigger happy), but never sees jail time? And how about the CEO of a large bank who somehow manages to convince the Treasury to allow the transfer of toxic debt from their balance sheet onto the backs of the public, sticking it to the average citizen struggling to pay the rent? What about that time a company starts laying employees off, but the new guy who doesn't even know his stuff yet, still keeps his job? Yeah, it is predominately because of 'who they know' and the fact that Masons will not turn on each other, even if they have one sorry excuse for a piece of crap brother whose a murderer. What was once a powerful force for good and freedom early in American history has quite simply been corrupted and exploited.Don't get me wrong, I very much revere General Patton, Eisenhower, and MacArthur as I borrow quotes from them all the time. Unfortunately, the world is so messed up right now, these wolves I previously spoke about are licking their chops once they get in, as they are fully aware of the level of benefits, protection, and more influential connections they will make. Every time I asked one of the new guys why they were joining, it was always a selfish response. \\"I'd like to have a political career someday.\\" or \\"I need a hookup.\\" (trying to get a better job)While working for Centcom, I can tell you the majority of Freemasons I knew were a step above the rest of us. But I cannot emphasize enough that some of the most corrupt, filthy, dangerous, thieving scumbags out there also wore the same robe. For much of the criminally inclined savages on earth, they will eventually face the law and justice will be served. But, there's a good chance that same criminal who wears a robe will be placed above the law. Depending on the circumstances and personality of the individual this can empower an ordinary criminal (including a thief) to become a VERY dangerous one.Quite frankly, there doesn't seem to be enough checks and balances, or rather they simply don't work too well since the tight-knit brotherhood can effectively result in a 'no snitch' policy.The adequate response from all Freemasons should be reflective in nature, to determine just how to make this right, restore what has been lost and prevent the great potential for tyranny, injustice, and further inequality.Another reason I had to comment, I really got tired of seeing folks bash some of my friends without even knowing any of them. Trust me, they're not sorcerers. Basically, there's a whole lot of good people doing great work, spending lots of time helping charities and who die regularly for our country, but there's a few rotten apples destroying anything good still left in the system.Just in case you're wondering, because of the aforementioned character issues of a \`few' really shady masons, AND because of my personal religious beliefs I will likely never join Freemasonry.I'd also like to consider this a plea for the Masonic leadership take this issue seriously, before it's too late. It may sound crazy, but the balance of power, future of humanity might very well depend on it. Just look around. Freemasons are just as much responsible for shaping the world today as they were way back then during early Colonial days. If the leadership hasn't even started to clean things up yet, it may be a sign it's time for all Freemasons to start shaking things up."},{"Title":"Morals and Dogma of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of Freemasonry","review":"This book is a classic.

I found it a quick read. It seems more modern than a book originally published in 1985. I had to remind myself that the references to Star Wars were to episodes 4, 5, and 6, not the more recent 1 and 2. LOL!I think Duane was very proud of all the work she put into creating the whale wizard culture and writing the poems for the singing but honestly, it was almost over-kill.

The plot flows nicely, and the characters come alive in my mind (even the whales!).An extremely well written book, DEEP WIZARDRY should be read by all science fiction fans! Madeline L'Engle fans should read this too, and anyone who likes to be nicely frightened."},{"Title":"Deep Wizardry: Young Wizard Series, Book 2","review":"Don't pay attention to the pigeonholing of these books as Young Adult -- I'm forty-five and I enjoy them at least as much as &quot;adult&quot; fantasy.Nita and Kit face some serious moral and ethical dilemnas in the waters off Long Island. The sequence where Nita finally figures out what to say to her parents is a classic. What a joy to see well-drawn believable adolescent characters with a sense of responsibility and moral character, without getting at all preachy.Duane isn't afraid to put some pretty intense stuff into her work -- a bit more scary jeopardy that some may be used to in adolescent fiction. But this remains the best of a fine series."},{"Title":"Deep Wizardry: Young Wizard Series, Book 2","review":"It was hard for Nita and Kit to believe that, not very long ago, they were two young teenagers, each trying to make their way in a world that was often frustrating. Now, thanks to a book titled 'So You Want To Be A Wizard,' they've embarked on an unexpected path, they have joined with others in the fight to slow entropy - to keep the world, and the universe, ticking along their mysterious ways. But for the moment they are between assignments, vacationing with Nita's parents at the Hampton beeches.Or rather, they were between assignments. Suddenly called on by the dolphins, Kit and Nita come to the rescue of one of the sea's wizards, S'reee, a blue whale. Rescues, S'reee asks for their aid in quelling a sudden rise in tremors in the seabed. They will help in performing an ancient ritual opera that reenacts the original binding of the dark one under the ocean. Nita promises more than she should, agreeing to play the most important part in the ritual one that will place her life in great danger.In company with S'reee, the teenagers, now transformed into whales themselves, travel the ocean, first to collect the rest of the singers, and then to descend to the darkest depths of the Hudson Canyon. Accompanying the whales is the 'other' player, the greatest of the great white sharks Ed'Rashtekaresket (henceforth known as Ed). It is the relationship between this ancient and terrifying shark and Nita that will determine the ending of this story.The magic of this story (and there is a lot of magic in this one) is in how it introduces the reader to the world of the ocean. It is a different world entirely than the 'high and dry' where we live. The rules are different and killers like Ed are fulfilling a role. Evil comes from elsewhere, and much of it arises from human negligence. As the whales journey on Nita and Kit learns lessons of bravery and compassion that will stay with them forever.And that's the real point of these tales, not whatever magic must be carried out, but in the underlying connectedness that makes everything precious. In the end, honesty and courage are rewarded, but Duane's skill is in making this happen without glossing over the hard parts. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Deep Wizardry: Young Wizard Series, Book 2","review":"DEEP WIZARDRY is the second book in a magical series by Diane Duane. It all starts when Nita and her family arrive at their beach house for a vacation. Before they left, she begged her pareents to invite her best friennd, Kit, to come along too. Unknown to their parents, Nita and Kit are wisards.One day they were trying out a new spell where they can walk on water, and they met a dolphin. The dolphin wanted them to help his friend S'ree, a whale, who was attacked by whale hunters earlier. Nita helped S'ree and found that she had a very hard decision to make. &quot;Will you play the Silent One?&quot; S'ree asked. Nita said, &quot;Yes,&quot; knowing only that it was part of a song that was made to reenact the origional singing of the twelve and the restraint of the Lone Power, Death. She does not know what the silent one does, but she will find out.I would definately recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading about magic and suspense. I loved it cover to cover because it has a lot of details, but lets you make some of it up on your own. The characters are my age, so I can easily relate with them. It is not quite as classy as books like the Narnia series, but it has a more intricate plot, and I liked it a little more."},{"Title":"Deep Wizardry: Young Wizard Series, Book 2","review":"I read this book for the first time while waiting for the release of the fourth Harry Potter book, looking for something to fill the empty space. To my surprise, I found a book that I would argue is at least as good as Harry Potter--and perhaps better.The second book in Diane Duane's YOUNG WIZARDS series starts with middle school friends, Nita and Kit, on vacation together with Nita's family at the beach. They think it's going to be just another summer, but they couldn't be more mistaken. Nita and Kit are both wizards, and the forces of evil don't take vacations. The job of wizards is to fight the Lone Power, the one who created death and continually attempts to trick people into accepting it. Wizards work with spells learned from their wizards' manuals, and the use of the Speech, a language that all things, animate or inanimate, understand.When Nita and Kit are summoned to help a whale wizard who's been wounded by whalers, they find out that things have not been going well in the Sea, and that if the wizards don't do something about it soon, the problems may spread to land in the form of earthquakes and tidal waves. The solution is to perform the Song of the Twelve in order to bind the Lone Power and keep It from wreaking havoc on the east coast. And in the case of these two young wizards, they have to do all this while keeping their powers secret from their parents, who are beginning to wonder what they spend their days doing.The main characters are compelling, but the supporting cast is just as strong, consisting of equal numbers of whales and humans. Duane's portrayal of life under the sea, and the ways that humans can unknowingly affect it, is insightful and true. The tension rises throughout the story, so that every scene is more intense than the next.I must have read this book ten times, and every time I get to the ending, I'm so caught up in it that I can't put it down until I'm done. The language of the story itself is beautifully descriptive, not just of the underwater world, but also of the characters' emotions. A story about friendship, duty, and sacrifice whose truth and beauty still amaze me, more than six years down the road.Reviewed by: Candace Cunard"},{"Title":"Deep Wizardry: Young Wizard Series, Book 2","review":"Caution: the book itself really *is* magic -- when you finish it, you won't be the same person you were when you started it.This is the book you give your kids because you know that not only will they be in good hands but also that they will become better people for having read it.\\"Deep Wizardry\\" (written decades before Harry Potter) is one of those timeless books that will live in the hearts and minds of everyone who reads it."},{"Title":"Deep Wizardry: Young Wizard Series, Book 2","review":"Diane Duane definitely has a gift, because this story has it all.

We get to know Nita a lot more in this book as well. She fears, she feels, she loves...Ed, the Pale Slayer, is an amazing character, and all of the sea creatures speak with such great beauty. Indeed, there are many quotables that can be taken from this book.\\"You, young and never loving.

In their previous adventures, Nita and Kit incurred a blank check debt to the powers they serve. Now, the debt is being called in. The whale wizard S'ree has asked Nita to fill in and play one of the participants in an ancient ritual to bind the Lone Power's growing influence in the area. But Nita agrees without knowing the very dear price she would have to pay for success, or how much her and Kit's special wizardy may influence the outcome.The ups? Duane has done her research and describes what, to me, seems like a pretty realistic seascape backdrop to frame the rest of the story. She also creates a pretty credible evil force to fight against, not to mention a situation that elicited a few tears (okay, more than a few) from me. Nita's predicament is handled in, what seems to me, a fairly realistic manner. I especially liked the way her advisor, Tom, handled it.Complications? Ms. Duane seems to ramble on occasion, and Nita's parents seemed pretty flat at times. I wonder if showing them some wizardry could truly convince them to accept Nita's role in saving the world. As for larger concerns, I found the plot fairly predictable, which may not be so bad in some ways. It says something about her ability to manage details and hint at what's to come. I guessed a decent amount of the plot, including Ed's role in resolving Nita's dilemma. I wondered if (or how) being spared changed Nita's perspective.

In the first book, So You Want to be a Wizard, Nita and Kit have bought time and requested help from the higher powers, which leaves them indebted to the greater powers. This book illustrates that sometimes, there is a price for using up a resource. Repaying a debt is not always easy, nor is it a light matter to take from someone who may not really expect repayment, but hopes for and counts on your repayment (and if you choose not to repay, there are prices yet again to pay that cannot be avoided). Although it may feel good in a way to Nita to know that people believe in her and count on her to follow through, first with repaying her debt and secondly with making the ultimate sacrifice, it is also a heavy burden that sometimes she wonders if she can carry.Duane plunges the reader into the water's depths along with Nita and Kit as they change form and become ocean animals. It's interesting and intriguing to \\"spend time\\" in such a setting, and to hear voices of other ocean animals - and feel (and see) their joys and sorrows. I fell in love with Ed, who had a witty, gruff, likable yet believable voice, and who takes a bite out of the typical idea that killer sharks are \\"mean and bad.\\" Will Ed also take a bite out of Nita when the song is sung and the time is right?

In this story there is something disturbing happening deep under the ocean. In order to prevent the world from being destroyed the Song of the Twelve must be sung. Each of the singers in the song plays a role in a drama that dates back to prehistoric times.Much of the story is devoted to learning about the history of the song and role the various original singers played, along with learning about each of the characters that are set to play the twelve. This background leads into the singing of the new song. Nita volunteers to play the part of the Silent Lord. However, Nita did not realize at the time that she volunteered that the job of Silent Lord comes at a price, a very high price.Skillfully woven into the background is resentment by some cetaceans that humans have been so careless with life and the ocean in general. Whales can long for revenge in the universe of the Young Wizards.Diane's tale is a fascinating look at life under the ocean as its inhabitants might perceive it. At the same time Diane took the opportunity to have Nita and Kit continue to mature, both in life as well as their wizardry. This tale is much darker than the first story in the series, and is meant for maturing young adults rather than children. However, if you are in the mood for a serious story, you'll find this sequel to be better than the original and will make you long for the next book in the series, \\"High Wizardry.\\""},{"Title":"Deep Wizardry: Young Wizard Series, Book 2","review":"I have read the first 3 books of the 5.

The whales must perform the Song again. Unfortunately, their Senior has been killed--his apprentice needs help that Kit and Nita are in the best position to give. Will they commit themselves to the Song and its dangers?Of course. They're wizards. How could they not?I can't come up with words for this book. It's shelved with children's books, but it is ageless. Of the original trilogy, themselves the best of the excellent Young Wizards series, this is the most mature, the darkest, and the strongest by so many degrees. The stakes are the same as they usually are: life and death. And love, of course. But only in _Deep Wizardry_ do Nita and Kit have so much time to reflect on the prices they may be asked to pay. There is no other character quite like Ed, the Pale Slayer, unfallen Destroyer--a colder Master than the Lone One could hope to be. Sacrifice is never more personal. And if you were to read only one Young Wizards book in your lifetime, it must be this one, for this one encapsulates the cost of the struggle against Death and all that it is worth.Read it. I have, many times, and I will read it again and again for all the sorrow, and all the joy."},{"Title":"Deep Wizardry: Young Wizard Series, Book 2","review":"Duane has builds a world of magic which is governed by rules. Unlike Harry Potter, Nita and Kit do not get any exceptions to the rules. This is magic with a price. Moreover there is a real sense of continuity, The events from the first book have consequence which affect what happens in this one. It had me hooked, as with the first book of the series I was willing to sacrifice quite a bit of sleep to read more faster. Even then I stopped at a moment of such tension that sleep eluded me for quite some time and I was half tempted to get up and keep reading.This is a great story with believable characters. Having said that There are one or two technical faults which I have been unable to overlook: Even though I was able to guess early on what the Nita had gotten herself into watching the same realization dawn on her was still nerve racking.1) Unpronounceable Names. yes they are whales but I still need to be able to read there names and I have no Idea how to read something with an exclamation mark in the middle of it, or with odd capitalization. It's distracting.2) Too much description. As others have noted some of the descriptions are also distracting and feel like the author showing off ... see I did my research I really know what the sea floor looks like off the cost of Long Island.If not for these points I would have given the book five starts."},{"Title":"Deep Wizardry: Young Wizard Series, Book 2","review":"While the overall theme of redemption is somewhat familiar (at least to anyone with any hint of something resembling a certain mainstream religion in their past [whether they want to admit to it or not]), Miss Duane is able to appropriate it and put it to good use by showing us that the act of redemption, while ultimately for the benefit of all, is not done lightly nor arrived at easily. The ending is unexpected and well-written, second only to that of the original book (IMHO)."},{"Title":"Deep Wizardry: Young Wizard Series, Book 2","review":"This is not only one of my favorite YA fantasies, but one of my many favorite books. The characters are believable, their responses to problems genuine, and their victories substantial. Readers see not only the responsibility, care, and devotion required to change the world for the better, but learn that to care does not mean to sacrifice innocent delight in the changing. This book introduces an intriguing &quot;Death&quot; figure--the Pale Slayer, a vast shark whom young Nita simply calls &quot;Ed&quot;--and deals honestly with the issues of sacrifice, evil, and afterlife that arise from Nita's awareness of her mortality."},{"Title":"Deep Wizardry: Young Wizard Series, Book 2","review":"This is a great thought provoking book. My favorite part is where she tells her parents about her wizardry. I'd wanted to hear that part since the first book. I recomend this to anyone and everyone no matter your age."},{"Title":"Deep Wizardry: Young Wizard Series, Book 2","review":"This book is so creative! I read the first three chapters, and then I couldn't put it down! You realy get to know the characters in this book. And then you start thinking like the characters. And pretty soon every thing that happens to them happens to you."},{"Title":"Deep Wizardry: Young Wizard Series, Book 2","review":"My favorite of the Wizardry books, Deep Wizardry combines lovely prose with beautiful snatches of poetry, wound around a plot that becomes more subtle and layered with every read. At the same time, it stays human and true to the characters' emotions: I was a teenager much like those two, and Duane has captured the confusion and uncertainty of adolescence perfectly. They may be wizards, capable of reducing the school bully to dust, but that doesn't mean life gets any easier. One of my all-time favorites."},{"Title":"Deep Wizardry: Young Wizard Series, Book 2","review":"I loved this book! The writing is beautiful, and the story itself makes you want to be Nita or Kit. This is, in my opinion, the best of the Wizardry books. It is also the one I read first. I have copied the poem everywhere, quote scenes to my friends,etc. READ THIS BOOK! If there's anyone else out there who loves this book as much as I do, please email me."},{"Title":"Deep Wizardry: Young Wizard Series, Book 2","review":"I believe that Deep Wizardry is the best book in the wizardry series! This time Nita and Kit are faced with a serious problem-their life, or millions of other lives? This book has a new twist on every page, and I never would have expected what happens in the end!

K.J.H."},{"Title":"Deep Wizardry: Young Wizard Series, Book 2","review":"&quot;Deep Wizardry,&quot; the second in Diane Duane's delightful &quot;So You Want To Be a Wizard&quot; series, is definitely my favorite. I really enjoyed being transported to a world that *I'll* never visit -- under (WAY under) the sea. Teenage wizards Kit and Nita take an undersea journey to assist the whales in completing a ceremony and along the way run into some *very* formidable foes, including a shark that still gives me nightmares! This book is in &quot;never-get-rid-of-'ems&quot; bookcase!"},{"Title":"Deep Wizardry: Young Wizard Series, Book 2","review":"This is a YA book about adolescents, but at 23 I find that it's still my all-time favorite. It's moving without being pretentious, and the dilemma presented is morally complex. Duane doesn't pull punches or talk down to readers (save for a few comic relief missteps which don't detract from the impact of the book). _Deep Wizardry_ is fascinating and fun, easy to read with some simple yet beautifully lyric turns of phrase. I reread my well-worn copy of it at least once or twice a year, and still find it satisfying. Playful, emotional, beautiful, realistic and a must-have for any intelligent fantasy-lover"},{"Title":"Deep Wizardry: Young Wizard Series, Book 2","review":"Diane Duane is back with a thrilling sequel to So You Wanna Be A Wizard. However, this book takes on a notably darker tone. It revists themes of friendship, trust, and most notably sacrifice, while creating an engaging plot and a unique brand of magic that allows readers to easily suspend disbelief. However, I was a little disappointed that the two promising protagonists, Kit Rodreiguez and Nita Callahan, failed to develop into more worthwhile characters. They lack any faults that would allow them to become more real in the reader's eye, and are almost too perfect to seem real. Much more convincing is the haunting \\"Ed,\\" Master Shark. He will remind readers familiar with the His Dark Materials Trilogy of the bear Iorek Byrnison. The poetry that Duane entwines with her prose is haunting and memorable."},{"Title":"Deep Wizardry: Young Wizard Series, Book 2","review":"I just finished this book and am racing to catch up to my daughter, who is on Book 4. She is ten and loved the Harry Potter series, so when she found this in the library we thought it would be great.It IS great -- these are fabulous, exciting yet thoughtful books, which she loves now and will get even more out of when she rereads them in a few years (which I'm sure she will). But. Unlike Harry Potter or Percy Jackson, these are a little less innocent sex-wise. In this book, there is a lot of indirect wondering about what exactly Nit and Kit are doing off alone together so much, which comes to a head when Nit's mother asks her if she and Kit are \\"messing around,\\" to which Nit replies, shocked, \\"You mean like having sex?!\\"It's a short scene, and good material for older teens, as it ends with Nit assuring her mother she would come talk to her before she \\"did anything like that.\\" But I don't think I would have let me daughter read them yet if I had known it was in there -- first because I'd rather she just not contemplate 13 year olds having sex, and second because it makes me wonder what is in the later books. Our local library may need to be \\"out\\" of books five and on for a few years."},{"Title":"Deep Wizardry: Young Wizard Series, Book 2","review":"I received a copy of So You Want To Be a Wizard that was intended for my sister from my cousin, who had mailed it from the UK. I didn't pick it up for a while, but as soon as I read it I was totally hooked on this series, and I spent weeks used bookstore hopping to find Deep Wizardry. Deep Wizardry is not only the best book in the Young Wizards series -- it's one of the best books I've ever read.Nita is a girl that any bookworm can relate to. She's got so many characteristics that reminded me of myself that I almost felt as if I was in her place; all of her problems were my problems, her joys my joys.Kit is the perfect companion character to Nita -- innocent as she is, but strong and supportive through all her decisions.The whales and dolphins each have their own unique personalities and conflicts. Their society is complex and ancient and portrayed beautifully.And of course we can't forget Ed -- the Pale Slayer. As Nita said, &quot;[his] name has teeth in it.&quot; The Pale Slayer is an ancient menace, shrouded in clouds of blood, with power over all the sharks in the sea. Some of his lines made such impressions on me that I don't think I'll ever forget them -- &quot;You, young and never loving; I, old and never loved.&quot;The book takes risks with the characters and the plot that lead into an intense psychological conflict -- the question of self-sacrifice for the greater good outlines the entire book. Not only does Duane manage to fit the story of the binding of the Lone Power into history and modern society, but she also draws the reader into the story with real life conflicts that make it completely believable for anyone who's willing to take a chance with magic.I read this book for the first time when I was twelve years old, and it completely changed my outlook on life. I laughed, I cried, I stayed up *way* past my bedtime -- I was in emotional turmoil along with Nita, I felt all the emotions that the characters felt. My heart raced all through the climax of the book. For weeks after reading it, I wondered how I would have reacted if I had been in such a situation, and if I would have the strength to make the sacrifices needed to complete the binding. Suffice to say, it made me THINK, and think hard.Now, years later, I still read this book often, and I rave about it to all my friends. Each time I read it, the story is still just as great. This is one of my favorite books of all time, and I'd recommend it to readers of all ages."},{"Title":"Deep Wizardry: Young Wizard Series, Book 2","review":"Diane Duane takes you on an unbelievable adventure with Nita and Kit. This book put a vivid picture of what was happening into my head. While I read it, it made me feel like my soul was singing to the melody of the waves Nita and Kit traveled through. Each bit of this book I gobbled up and when I was done, I was thirsty for more. This has to be the best piece of literature I have EVER read. But for people who don't believe in magic a bit, you probably wouldn't like it. For everyone else, you have to read this book!"},{"Title":"Deep Wizardry: Young Wizard Series, Book 2","review":"This is the best of the three initial books in Duane's Wizardry series. There is plenty of thrilling action, the ethics and philosophy of wizarding is intelligently extended beyond its presentation in the first book, and Nita's evolving relationship with her family is well woven into the story of cetacean wizards and their battle with the Lone Power. The author also brings vividly to life the sights, sounds and sensations of the deep sea.Still, the characters stand out over and above the merits of the other aspects of the book. The parents and adult characters are sympathetic and believable, Nita's little sister Dairine shows up in a new light, and even the dog has a personality!Each undersea character - whale-wizards, mostly - has a distinctive personality and tone well matching his/her species and history. The crowning achievement of the book is Ed'Rashtekaresket (Ed for short) the Master-Shark, whose very name has teeth in it. His dark, complex and fascinating character is gradually revealed through his developing relationship with Nita - as she realizes, and comes to terms with, the implications of the parts the two of them will sing at the TwelveSong Ceremony.The book should appeal to adults as well as to the ten-to-teens age group to whom the book is marketed."},{"Title":"Deep Wizardry: Young Wizard Series, Book 2","review":"In &quot;Deep Wizardry,&quot; Diane Duane's two adolescent wizards, Nita and Kit (for Christopher) are caught up in a reenactment of an undersea ritual in order to help defeat death (entropy). To this end they must not only transform themselves into whales, but must also manage to avoid Nita's parents without lying, because a wizard dares not lie. In this second volume of the wizardry series, the wizards' need for freedom in their struggle mirrors most adolescents' need for freedom, but with this difference: Nita and Kit know why they need their freedom and what they're going to do with it, a knowledge that justifies their and, by extension, all adolescents' struggle for freedom. On the simple wizardry front, this book is a great deal easier to follow than &quot;So You Want to Be a Wizard,&quot; and it fills out many details that were only adumbrated in that book. From my adult perspective, that ease, combined with the adolescent issues, made it a bit less enthralling than the first book, but I suspect that the flaw is in me and not in the book. I certainly never considered not finishing the book. Wizardry as Duane construes it requires good character, discipline, perseverance, and also not a little scientific ability (as when all the ocean-going participants need to figure out how much air they will need for their trip). The wizards set good examples while doing really cool things, a fantastic combination. My favorite character was the shark. Like Milton's Satan, he really steals the show."},{"Title":"Deep Wizardry: Young Wizard Series, Book 2","review":"As the second book in Diane Duane's wizardry series, Deep Wizardry emphasizes the pwer of friendship. Duane does an excellent job of demonstrating a theme of the need for friends and family while keeping the suspense throughout the climax. Nita and KIt are at the beach with Nita's family when they are called into action as wizards. Befirending a whale, a dolphin, and a big shark named Ed would never seem like a possibility. What is more unbelievable to the reader, is how human-like the animales are. Nita will undergo a struggle trying to keep their wizardry away from those who love her. Nita and Kit prepared for the &quot;Song of Twelve,&quot; without first knowing the consequences. Many important things in life are needed for success.Through their wizardry, Nita and Kit have become close friends. They decide that they are in it together, but they don't realize how deep that goes. On a supposed vacation they find themselves \`on active status.' Probably the first time they realize that they are always on duty. Going out into the ocean to help the whale wizards is a danger they deicide to risk. Kit and Nita realize the real bond between them when each begins to worry about the other.Along the way, Kit and Nita meet a few interesting people, or should I say animals?! Duane exercises anthropomorphism, and attributes human characteristics to animals. A whale named S'reee becomes a motherly figure, she is a strong and fearless leader despite her young age. Hotshot, a dolphin, is just that! He is like many humans who like to show off. The big threat is a great white shark named Ed, or that's what they call the \`Pale Slayer.' Nita learns to respect Ed as the young respect the elder, but the real surprise is when Ed begins to respect Nita. They even become friends.In wizardry you need the support of your family and those who love you, just as in life. Nita and Kit, however, try to keep their wizardry a secret from Nita's family. The big problem with this, it not their curiosity of Nita and Kit's absence but the need for their support. Eventually, Nita and Kit explain their situation and are filled with the love and compassion they need to endure it.During the \\"Song of Twelve,\\" comes the true test of sacrifice. Who is willing to give up their life for others? Who will rescue those in danger? Sometimes it's hard to have faith and trust that everything will work out. True friends are separated from the phony in the face of danger, and Nita figures that out. If becoming a whale isn't bad enough, taking the responsibilities of one is worse. The denouement or conclusion of the story was well written by Duane. Something we didn't expect came out of the friendships that Nita formed.In conclusion, the themes that Duane wanted to make evident are seen not only in the book, but in everyday life. Nita needs the support of her family and close friends to have faith that her sacrifice will bring good. It is important for Nita to stick to her word even though she didn't know what she was agreeing to. Without love and companionship, it is hard to have trust. Without doubt and fear, it is hard to call something a sacrifice. Mostly, without teamwork, you can't have success."},{"Title":"Deep Wizardry: Young Wizard Series, Book 2","review":"The sequel to So You Want To Be A Wizard, Deep Wizardry takes up the story as Nita and Kit become sadder and wiser. Having survived the alternative Manhattan, they are now faced with the results of their actions: The Song of the Twelve, a ritual which has to be performed to bind the Lone Power. When Nita volunteers to play a key role, she doesn't realise the terrible price before it's too late. With a wrenching moral dilemma as well as Duane's trademark descriptiveness and humour, this is well worth reading."},{"Title":"Deep Wizardry: Young Wizard Series, Book 2","review":"I've only read the first and second books in the series so far, but the second one is the best in my opinion. I got it when I was eleven and have read it so many times that I've worn the corners away. It's been years since I first got it, but I still take it out for an occasional read. The imagery is wonderful and you can really feel the danger. It's much brighter than the first one, which is why I didn't like that one as much. But they're still fantastic books and I'd recommend them to anyone. (---second one's better!---) *lol*"},{"Title":"Deep Wizardry: Young Wizard Series, Book 2","review":"I love Deep Wizadry.

No, I'm not crazy - if you've ever read a really good book, you'll know what I mean - you don't realise it is a book!! Enjoy."},{"Title":"Deep Wizardry: Young Wizard Series, Book 2","review":"This is one that deserves a better review than it's been given so far.After their initial ordeal, wizards Juanita (Nita) Callahan and Christopher (Kit) Rodriguez are counting on a little R&R; on vacation at the beach with Nita's family. But when a large, unpaid debt comes due and Nita and Kit are assigned to help a group of whale wizards enact an ancient ceremony, only a miracle may be able to save Nita from the ultimate sacrifice.Ed, the age-old shark, and his relationship with Nita are masterful. A stroke of much more than common writing. You can never be truly comfortable with him...as you should never...but the little you can see through his eyes is truly intriguing.The scenes where Nita finally has to come clean about her wizardry to her parents, and her panicked consultation with her local Senior, Carl, are some of the best in the series...as much because of the awful, heart-rending context Nita is trying to function in as anything.In the end, the solution isn't a cop-out--a high price is paid-- though it feels a little like one. (I was a little confused that Kit's role in creating the blank check wizardry behind the dilemma was never explored--he was just as responsible for any of it as Nita ever was.)May I recommend getting your hands on Christina Moore's excellent audio version of this story. Almost had me bawling."},{"Title":"Deep Wizardry: Young Wizard Series, Book 2","review":"I've always been into the &quot;magic&quot; kind of theme in reading, and so when I picked up this book a few years ago, it was just another book to me, but when I finally got into it, I was shocked. This really is one of the best fantasies out there. You don't need to have read &quot;So You Want to Be a Wizard&quot; to understand it, but I would highly recomend all the books in the series. In &quot;Deep Wizardry&quot;, the book starts out on a Long Island Beach in New York with a girl named Juanita, or Nita as she prefers, just going out for a walk on the beach with her dog. Just a few pages into it, you discover that she and Kit (Christopher) are wizards, and have the ability to do some great stuff. They're only 12-13, but you find out that the two have made some pretty impressive accomplishments already, and now, it's up to them to save the world (sorry for the cliche). With some help from a few friendly and a few not-so friendly sea creatures, you're led deep under the sea, where magic that's older than time itself sings it's ancient song. In the end, there's a great final climax with a twist, and Nita and Kit almost don't make it out alive."},{"Title":"Deep Wizardry: Young Wizard Series, Book 2","review":"I love the \\"Young Wizards\\" series and have been reading it since the beginning. I got behind over the last few years and got the Kindle versions of the early books to catch up and then read the last couple of books. I love my Kindle, but \\"Deep Wizardry\\" is an example of the worst of the paper to Kindle conversions. First, there is no Table of Contents. Arrgh. Second, I'm 23% into the book and have found numerous *obvious* typos. Misspellings and sentences that make no sense whatsoever are commonplace. It's like they used a pre-edit copy of the book to convert to the digital version. Or just scanned the original copy and used OCR software to convert it to digital, without an editor checking it for accuracy.I would give the hard copy version 5 stars, but can't give the Kindle version more than 4 stars for the horrible conversion. I'm not sure if it's Amazon or the publisher, but I wish someone would do a final edit on the digital versions before publishing. As the publishers are now charging higher and higher prices for the digital copies (I paid $1 MORE for the digital version over the hard copy version for 2 books recently! What's that about?), they need to ensure the digital book versions are at least as good as the hard copy versions, if not better! If anything, they should correct any typos that somehow made it into the published copy! And Amazon should ensure that the publishers are giving them good versions, WITH tables of contents!I don't hold Diane Duane (or other authors) responsible, but if I were an author, I'd be highly upset over such a horrible conversion of one of my books.***Follow-up to the conversion problem: I sent a copy of my comments to Diane Duane via her website and got a response from Ms. Duane within hours! She is aware of the problems and has been working with the publisher on correcting all the typos for several weeks now. See[...] for what they are doing about it. Her books should be typo free in the next month or so!I am more impressed than ever with Ms. Duane! While I think this is a publisher/Amazon problem, not an author problem, she is personally working to ensure that her e-readers will get a quality product from her!

I started reading them in my 20s and I still enjoy the series even into my late 30s.Very much superior to \\"other\\" books about young wizards, Diane Duane's wizardly universe is filled with wonder and magic, but no quick fixes...all wizardry here carries a price! Duane sets up a system of rules, making wizardry in her world more believable in the process. You dont just wave a wand and say something in faux latin, you have to LEARN how to do magic, effort is required. I also like that ANYONE can be a wizard, not just those lucky enough to be born with a \\"gift\\".All of this is just the window dressing, so to speak. The real enjoyment of this series is getting to know Nita and Kit, and all of the other wonderful characters. If I have one complaint, is that these characters do not seem to age as the series progresses. I sincerely hope that Nita and Kit are allowed to grow up a bit going forward...Deep Wizardry is probably my favorite in the series, mainly just for one scene...the \\"coming out\\" of Nita and Kit to Nita's parents. You have to read it for yourself, I wont spoil it, but I have to say...VERY VERY few books have moved me to tears...the sheer beauty of the scene Diane Duane writes, the reactions of the characters...all of it FELT very real while reading it, and even now in remembrance it still moves me.I would recommend reading \\"So you want to be a Wizard\\" first, but unfortunately, the Kindle version is not available yet.

By and large, they enjoyed the book. We were struck, however, by two aspects of the book that dramatically decreased our enjoyment of it. First, many parts of the book contain seemingly endlessly detailed descriptions that go on for pages. These often do not serve to clarify the nature of the involved sceens, but instead, more often than not, cloud them (and make readers just say \\"OK, let's just get on with it\\"). The detail was also potentially detremental in that it left little to the imagination.The other less than appealing aspect of the book was its generally intense and mostly humorless tone. Whereas the intense situations in the Harry Potter books are made tolerable by the addition of humor infused throughout the book, this book fell short. There is precious little comic relief to be found in Deep Wizardry. We may very well stop our reading of the series with this book, despite the pact that we own the whole series."},{"Title":"Deep Wizardry: Young Wizard Series, Book 2","review":"The sequel to So You Want to Be a Wizard. I loved that book so I though I would like this one. I liked every other wizard book she has written except this one. I always fell asleep reading it. The spells and magic stuff are cool but the plot just wasn't as good as High Wizardry, A Wizard Abroad, and the Book of Night With Moon. It got so boring after they had to tell Nita's parents that they were wizards. I didn't even know that Nita hadn't died (since I never finished it) until I read the next book in the series. I give it 3 stars because the plot kinda sucked but the Stuff was cool."},{"Title":"Deep Wizardry: Young Wizard Series, Book 2","review":"I got this book for CHRISTMAS and it looked really stupid. about half a year later i got so bored with my other books that i started reading it. it wasn't the best book i have ever read for two reasons 1: i read at an average of 150+ books a year and it is hard to pick favorites 2: i read a recent book that i simply fell in love with. it is by Annette Curtis Klause, and if you liked this series you will also enjoy anything by her. so A young wisards series is my second Favorite book series. i learned two things from reading this fantastic book. 1: never ever judge a book by its cover 2: i love fantsy novels!!!"},{"Title":"Deep Wizardry: Young Wizard Series, Book 2","review":"This book was so boring... It could have been a lot more effective if it was shorter and more to-the-point."},{"Title":"Deep Wizardry: Young Wizard Series, Book 2","review":"Thirteen-year-old Nita \\"Neets\\" Callahan, and her best friend, twelve-year-old Christopher \\"Kit\\" Rodriguez, never could have fathomed that they would become full-fledged wizards before they even hit high school. But the last few months have made it quite clear that that is exactly what has happened. Since coming across two separate copies of the mysterious book \\"So You Want to Be A Wizard...\\" both Nita and Kit have found themselves thrown into a tumultuous roller coaster ride filled with triumph, despair, and a whole lot of magic. Their first mission, leading them to a battle with the Lone Power, to protect Manhattan from succumbing to a lifetime of dark and cold was a success, but the two friends can't help but wonder if their future missions will have the same results. However, at the moment, neither one wants to think about it. In fact, all they want to do is contemplate the fun they'll have during their summer vacation. When Nita's parents announce that they'll be spending a glorious two weeks living beyond their means in a rented beach cottage in Southhampton, Nita is thrilled. She'll be able to cast away the muggy Manhattan weather for some rest and relaxation romping among the various beaches along the sunny, slightly tropical Southhampton shores, away from traffic, smog, and, hopefully, magic. While the vacation sounds thrilling to Nita, however, she can't help but feel as if she's abandoning Kit by leaving him all by his lonesome in the city. After all, they're used to relying on one another when it comes to magic, and can't even contemplate the trouble they'll be in if something should arise during their time apart. So, clearing it with her parents, Nita gets the okay for Kit to accompany her family on their eagerly awaited trip. The two can't wait to toss their jeans aside and don swimsuits for their two weeks out of city limits. But, from the very beginning, it's quite obvious that rest and relaxation are the last two things on their agenda. When Nita is approached by a dolphin while swimming the stress of the school year away, she calls upon Kit to assist her in aiding a fellow wizard in need. There's a catch, however. This wizard is not your typical, run-of-the-mill human. Rather, the wizard, who goes by the name of S'ree is a whale. To assist S'ree, both Kit and Nita must do something extremely foreign to them: shapeshift. It is only by completing this task that they will have the ability to join an exclusive group consisting of whales and dolphins that they will be able to take part in an ancient, and, unbeknownst to them, fairly deadly, ritual. Their task will not be easy. Not only do they have to find the strength, and ability within themselves to keep their human mind, and not become stuck in their sea creature bodies, but they must also face characters much more deadly, and frightening, than the Lone Power, such as the sharp-toothed Master Shark. Master Shark is another player in the deep-sea ritual, and he'll be doing something that he has much experience with - eating someone. The most terrifying thing is that the someone he'll be eating is one of the young wizards.It has been quite some time since I first met the young wizards - Nita and Kit - within the pages of SO YOU WANT TO BE A WIZARD. Yet I instantly fell into a comfortable familiarity with them as I dove into DEEP WIZARDRY. It is obvious that, from the previous installment, and the horror that Nita and Kit overcame within the pages of SO YOU WANT TO BE A WIZARD has assisted them in growing - both mentally and physically. That newfound maturity is displayed quite a bit within the pages of DEEP WIZARDRY, as both Nita and Kit must face some extremely difficult, and grown-up issues, such as death, love, and family. Nita's difficulty in divulging the information regarding her powers to her family weighs heavily in this particular installment. While her younger sister, Dairine, seems to have already put two-and-two together to come to the conclusion that Nita has some sort of strange power, her parents are under the impression that she's sneaking around with Kit romantically. Nita is forced to reach deep within herself to find the strength to let her parents know the truth - even if they disown her for it. While it seems as if that is the largest struggle Nita must face within DEEP WIZARDRY, it doesn't quite compare with the growing feelings and attachment she has formed towards Kit. Feelings that are confusing and exciting at the same time. While Diane Duane hasn't made romance the main focus of the tale, she has floated the idea of the two young wizards someday getting together out there, making the reader attuned to the possibility. Kit, on the other hand, seems to have slightly more freedom than Nita within this tale, mainly because his parents are out of sight, and he only has the Callahan family to contend with. That does not leave him anymore reckless than before, however. In fact, it is within DEEP WIZARDRY that Kit shows an extremely protective side of his personality in his gestures to keep Nita safe; while, at the same time, he faces many inner struggles as he attempts to keep his human mind, even when in the body of a sea creature. Duane has, once again, penned a compelling story that keeps the reader engrossed, and excited to come back for more. Gripping from start to finish!Erika SoroccoFreelance Reviewer"},{"Title":"Deep Wizardry: Young Wizard Series, Book 2","review":"Just to make sure, if you have not read Book One: \\"So, you Want to be a Wizard?\\", do not read this review, and do not read this book until you have finished book One, this is book 2. You will not understand very much if you skip book one and this book will lack depth for you. Ok, enough said. On to the actual review:If I were to say a simple statement about this book, it would be shortened to a simple \\"Wow\\", period. But, there's always more to a book than saying \\"wow\\" and leaving it at that.So, the story follows two young wizards: Nita Callahan and Kit Rodriguez, who have just finished fighting the manipulative \\"Lone Power\\" in Manhattan (See book one \\"So, You want to be a Wizard?\\") they are now on vaction at a beach, or so they thought. After going for a smim, Nita encounters a dolphin who knows the new senior(essentially the \\"most wise and educated\\" wizard) of that area and soon the two wizards are sent head over heels into a huge ceremony that may be more than they bargained for.Nita starts by rescuing the stranded senior, tranferring her blood to save the dying whale, S'reee, and is then asked to help in the ritual that is performed each year to bind the Lone Power at the Bottom of the Sea before it can recreate the fate Atlantis suffered. S'reee tells the young wizards that she needs help, and of course, Nita and Kit volunteer. Nita offers to sing as the \\"Silent Lord\\", but during the Song of Twelve, many of the whale wizards sing the ritual songs as they have done many times, but they also enact the fates of those singers as well. And that means that Nita has to do what the Silent Lord did so long ago: accept the deadly gift of the Lone Power and then kill death by sacrificing herself to the Pale Slayer... A giant Shark!With her mind on the song and how she will deal with her oath, Nita and Kit also have to worry about Nita's parents who are growing suspicious, and Nita's nosy sister, Dairine. As they move forward, Nita discovers that the Pale Slayer, Ed, has more to him than a cold, matter of fact killing machine and that his views on life, though he is not a wizard is not entirely wrong... even if that means Nita will have to die.A moving, accurate book with whales, sacrifice and thrills beyond the scope of the normal seas! Fantastic Read! (Look for the next book \\"High Wizardry, Book 3 if you liked this one)."},{"Title":"Deep Wizardry: Young Wizard Series, Book 2","review":"This book was well put together but got me really confused.

Otherwise this book was pretty good."},{"Title":"Deep Wizardry: Young Wizard Series, Book 2","review":"The first book in the \\"Young Wizards\\" series, _So You Want to Be a Wizard_, is one of the best of the YA books I've read. This book, the first sequel, doesn't have the the outrageous, clever humor of the first book, but it replaces it with amazing personal drama and a sense of tragedy-no other YA book I've read gets closer to the level of great adult fantasy literature (with the possible exception of Garth Nix's _Sabriel_).Wizards Nita and Kit must save New York from an ocean disaster by participating with whale sorcerers in a ceremony to calm the Lone Power...a ceremony that may require the sacrifice of Nita's life. Duane approaches the level of great science fantasy writers Fritz Leiber and L. Sprague de Camp in this work of modern fantasy, and manages to embarass Harry Potter in the extreme. Thoroughly exceptional, and adults take notice-you'll love this book as much as the younger readers."},{"Title":"Deep Wizardry: Young Wizard Series, Book 2","review":"Although I have only read three of Duane's books, I think that this book is the best.

Then, when Kit and Nita meet a dolphin out on the beach, things just start to get worse. It starts with helping a beached whale, then becoming whales themselves.

Then, the two slip out of the house using magic, only to get introuble with their whale-friend, Sree. That is when Nita finds out that she will have to die to save the earth, and her parents haven't a clue.Because of this, Nita and Kit must explain everything to their parents, even the part about the whales.

They go out one night to practice walking on water when a dolphin finds them and brings them to a fatally injured whale whom they heal and discover is a fellow wizard. The whale's mentor has recently been killed and she is in charge of a great ceremony to bind the evil force that Nita and Kit had run into in their first adventure. And Nita agrees to the part of the Silent Lord in that ceremony little realizing what price she will have to pay.This is one of the best books I've read. I discovered it when I was twelve and have read it so many times the front cover fell off and the top right corner of every page is rounded they've been turned so many times. Definitely a book for younger people, but it's still a fun read and you get more of the issues if you read it later on.

Although I am almost 50, I think many of the best books are written for young adults, so I was looking in that section when I came across it. I borrowed the first three books and started them right away. I didn't enjoy the first book so much, but when I finished it, I already had the second book in hand and decided to give the series one more try. Deep Wizardry is soooo good. It seemed like Ms. Duane's writing was better. Maybe it's just that the first book had to introduce all the characters, the idea of wizardry from her point of view... But I couldn't book the second book down, and I have been hooked ever since. I recently got a Kindle Fire for my birthday and am looking for books to read. I think I will pick up Deep Wizardry. I don't own the first three books, having returned them to the library, but I own most of the others in hardcover.

The sacrifice made by Ed'Rashtekerasket (or however his name is spelled) made the ending quite memorable, and that's probably the reason why the I fell for the book (I have a soft spot for sacrifices). Over all a very well written book, with a more challenging vocabulary for it's age group (for some reason I'm speaking as if I'm not a part of that age group).

It has the classic \\"Beauty and The Beast\\" theme which happens to be a favorite of mine. Samantha was a spunky heroine who's quick wit and spunk made her the perfect match for her impatient patient. Gabriel was a hero to be adored. Unlike most \\"wounded\\" heroes who choose to sulk and mope about - Gabriel's defense was witty sarcasm and a beastly temper. He was a complete ass and I simply adored him!I found myself laughing out loud several times throughout the book and even came close to shedding a tear or two.Highly Recommended!"},{"Title":"Yours Until Dawn","review":"I have to confess that I've loved nearly all of Medieros's books but this has turned into one of my all-time favorites. Gabriel was such a sexy, interesting hero and Samantha was more like a real person because she made mistakes and wasn't always perfect. (Or maybe it's because we share the same name and initials!) I was so surprised to read that a few readers didn't like the \\"twist\\" in the book because to me, that's what set it apart from some of the other cookie cutter books out there right now. I like a big plot. I like it when characters grow and I like it when that growth is built around a big, juicy romance like the one in this book. This is a true classic romance in the vein of Judith McNaught and it's wonderful to find a story with a little meat on its bones. Can't wait to see what Medieros comes up with next!"},{"Title":"Yours Until Dawn","review":"I don't know what the Publishers Weekly reviewer was smoking when they wrote their review but apparently we didn't read the same book. If she didn't spot the delicate foreshadowing in this story, then she must have been skimming because I thought the twists in this book were some of the best I'd ever read. You almost have to go back and re-read it to pick up on everything. The plot has already been summarized, so I'll skip that and just say that if Gabriel and Samantha's love story doesn't make you laugh out loud and cry, then I'll eat my copy of the book.

The story was almost TOO predictable, which tends to take a lot out of the story for me, and the \\"plot twist\\" was completely obvious --- in fact, because I saw it so immediatley, and it's been so overused, I REALLY wanted Medeiros to surprise me and turn the other way around. When she didn't, I found myself excessively disappointed. I've become so used to Medeiros taking a common type of story and twisting it around to make it her own, and this just wasn't up to her usual standard.Still, as usual, her writing style is engaging, and her characters --- with the exception of the very obvious herione who was ruined for me --- were intriguing at least. In spite of its banality, the way Medeiros told her story was still fun to read. The \\"battle of wills\\" was certainly enjoyable --- a will battle as only Teresa Medeiros can write one. But I wouldn't recommend this novel very highly, most of her novels are significantly better."},{"Title":"Yours Until Dawn","review":"This was my first Medeiros' book, and it certainly won't be my last. The hero was wonderful (sexy, and brooding) and the heroine was smart and determined (which I always like). I do wish that she hadn't turned out to be who she was . . . but I guess you can't have everything. I'll even forgive the addition of Lassie to the cast (I kid you know, a kindly, life-saving, collie).I was especially pleased with the fact that she made Gabriel a navel hero, rather than the usual army/cavalry hero. The Royal Navy always gets short shrift in romance (and I'm addicted to Horatio Hornblower . . . so I have a soft spot for the boys in blue)."},{"Title":"Yours Until Dawn","review":"I found myself surprised, which is unusual in a romance novel.

Only,fear sets in as Gabriel steals Samanthas heart and his love threatens to uncover the secret that she has so painstakingly worked to hide.\\"Yours Until Dawn\\" was an ok read, but ultimately I was left disappointed. The book was too easy to set down and the characters failed to come to life for me. I found many of the situations hard to believe and I felt that Samanthas \\"secret\\" was extremely obvious - I wasnt at all shocked when it was revealed.This book wasnt awful...I did enjoy some of its secondary characters and I would love to see a story written about Gabriels friend Martin Worth.All in all, not a bad read, but not a keeper."},{"Title":"Yours Until Dawn","review":"Yours Until Dawn is a story similar to Helen Keller but with a romantic twist. Lieutenant Gabriel Fairchild, Earl of Sheffield, joined the Royal Navy to prove to his lady, Cecily, that he was worthy of her love. When the British Navy routs the French at Trafalgar, flying shrapnel injures Gabriel, causing him to lose his sight. Not only does he lose his sight, he also loses Cecily when she turns tail and runs away at the first sight of him.Months later, Gabriel is ensconced at Fairfield Park in seclusion and living like an animal. The household is desperate to find a nurse who will put up with him. Their prayers are answered when Miss Samantha Wickersham responds to their advertisement. Theirs is an uphill battle of wills as Gabriel gradually succumbs to Samantha's care and instruction. She helps him adjust to life as a blind man but loses her heart in the process. A dangerous accident changes the lives of both. Gabriel begins to regain his sight and Samantha, believing that her services are no longer required, leaves Fairfield Park after spending a passionate night with Gabriel.Gabriel is desperate to find Samantha and he exhausts all resources to locate her but she continues to elude him. After months of searching, he begins to reconcile himself to the fact that she may never be found. He decides to do the one thing he believes will honor her and that is to go back to sea.There are few romance titles that are on my short list of absolute favorite books, but Yours Until Dawn would easily make it among the top five. It is brilliantly written with a solid story line and unforgettable characters. It's not a fast read but well worth it. There are no subplots to draw attention away from the main story or add depth to it. In fact, the main storyline is so beautifully simplistic that any subplots would only dilute its enchantment.I highly recommend Yours Until Dawn.

When he finally fell in love with a female immune to his charms, he wanted to prove he could make something more of himself than just the illustrious station he'd been born to. Sailing off to war in his majesty's Royal Navy he has now returned home, scarred and blind - a bitter man knowing that his beloved Cecily had run in fright from his bedside. After months of self imposed exile his father hires and send to the country estate a nurse, Samantha Wickersham. It was her job to nurse him back from a self imposed exile and to help him to adjust to his blindness. What Samantha found was a man whose actions spoke more of a beast than a sane man. As she worked to help him find his place in his new world, she found that the place she most wanted to be was with him - always.Starting out with a very serious theme the author uses her exceptional talent to bring forth both an inspirational and touching tale of love sprinkled with her trademark touches of humor that will have you laughing out loud. Samantha was a very strong-willed heroine with a mission. Gabriel, the once golden boy of the ton, not only had to learn to live in a world of darkness but deal with the betrayal of the woman he'd been so foolishly trying to impress. With memorable secondary characters, including a lovable and mischievous pup the reader is in for another of Medeiros' witty and entertaining novels sure to delight all of her discerning fans. This was truly a real sweetheart of a memorable read I highly recommend. --- Marilyn Rondeau, for www.historicalromancewriters.com ---"},{"Title":"Yours Until Dawn","review":"I have been waiting a year for her new novel and you will not be disappointed with this book.

A must read for historical romance fans.I absolutely love the theme of the heroine working in a domestic capacity for the hero, as it puts them in close proximety to each other for weeks (if not months), which in turn really makes for a much more believable romance. In this great romance novel, the heroine is a nurse trying to aide an earl who lost his eyesite in the war. Their relationship develops into something soul deep, but the best part is the last half of the book. But I can't say more as I don't want to give anything away. If you love historical romances, this is a must read."},{"Title":"Yours Until Dawn","review":"I liked this book, but I didn't love it. The relationship between Gabriel and Samantha was really satisfying until the ridiculous way he regained his sight intruded. Then there was a tangle of misunderstandings and the typical 'I'm not good enough' response from Samantha. As one of the other reviewers said, I too wish that he had made the ultimate declaration before he heard the whole story."},{"Title":"Yours Until Dawn","review":"I just loved this book! Set in the regency historical period, its basically a Florence Nightingale type tale of a blinded soldier who falls in love with his nurse. The hero is determined not to accept any help as much as the heroine is determined to pull him out of the darkness (so to speak). Really writing anything more would be a spoiler. Its very touching at times, not highly emotional mind you, but just a sweet romance. If you like authors like Julia Quinn, Lisa Kleypas, Sabrina Jeffries, or anyone similar who writes in this genre, then you'll enjoy this book too. I got it as an ebook from the NYC library and now I'm scrambling to get it in paperback to go on my keeper shelf."},{"Title":"Yours Until Dawn","review":"I loved this book. It was a nice, well written romantic story that held together very well for most of the book. At the end of the book i felt as it both characters had grown tremendously since their first meeting (which isn't actually narrated but is alluded to). Both Gabriel and Samantha had suffered so much because of youthful mistakes that i was very happy to see them together in the end (i know they always end up together but i liked the way they did).There was one part i didn't quite get though, i didn't understand why Cecily had to have a final fling with him without disclosing her identity. That made me feel as if the author was trying to fit in the requisite number of sex scenes.Still, it's a good read. Enjoy"},{"Title":"Yours Until Dawn","review":"I love all Teresa Medeiros books, except Lady Counquerer. Yours Until Dawn is another favorite. I love the story line, love the witty dialogues between the Gabriel and Samantha, but somehow the story lost its strenght nearing the ending, somehow I found the last few chapters as too fast, as if Ms. Medeiros forgot to use her magic touch in weaving the story and characters shown in previous chapters and only too eager to tie all loose ends. Gabriel conflicting feeling towards Samantha and Cecily should have been explored more deeply. Thus the 4 stars for less than perfect ending."},{"Title":"Yours Until Dawn","review":"It's not really taking a chance when you pick up a book by Theresa Medeiros; you can always bet on an enjoyable read, if not a moving one.While not my favorite book of hers, this one is good. The plot devices are not particularly unexpected, and I have to admit the saw what was coming the whole time. That being said, it was still worth reading and getting to know the characters."},{"Title":"Yours Until Dawn","review":"This story is true to life story of Beauty and the Beast. I loved it. I love reading different writings of Beauty and the Beast, Taming of the Shrew, Seven Brides for Seven Brothers, Cinderella,"},{"Title":"Yours Until Dawn","review":"Author Theresa Medeiros' signature humor shines on every page of YOURS UNTIL DAWN. Set in England about six months after Admiral Nelson's death at Trafalgar in 1805, the constant verbal sparring between hero and heroine kept me turning pages despite the lack of a significant outside threat to life and limb. That's unusual for me. In this story, the romance doesn't develop in the midst of conflict. The romance IS the conflict.The Big Reveal of the heroine's secret at about the three-quarter point in the story completely blindsided me, and that's unusual too. I still can't say the author dropped enough clues earlier to provoke one of those \\"I should have seen that coming\\" moments, but the unexpected twist was intriguing instead of disruptive. THAT is the part of this book I'll always remember."},{"Title":"Yours Until Dawn","review":"I really liked this book! The twist was a complete surprise, but made sense with explanation. I was a bit doubtful as to the hero and everyone's interactions with one another after the twist was revealed, but it was a good book overall."},{"Title":"Yours Until Dawn","review":"Really enjoyed this book loved it all the way to the end.

I am a fan for life."},{"Title":"Yours Until Dawn","review":"This is the second book i have ever read by Teresa Medeiros. Yours until Dawn was an enchanting read. The author portrayed two very likeable characters whom are hard not to love. This is a book about second chances mostly, and it was great. Medeiros has an amazing ability for description and detail and for writing very endearing characters. Sure, the book had some inconsistencies, especially with his family, who never really got a set down by Gabriel as they so deserved, especially his mother for wishing his death. The last two chapters of the book left me a bit confused also because i could not decide if i loved it or not. I probably would have picked a different way in which Gabriel \\"finds out\\". I was not crazy at the way he was around her and did not realised who she was. Finally, Samantha's surprise was indeed unexpected, but i liked it, what i did not like was the way she acted in those final chapters. Overall, the book to me was great, i did not love some things but it did not deterred me from finding this book captivating."},{"Title":"Yours Until Dawn","review":"This has been the second time I enjoyed this book and it was as wonderful as the first. I literally was up until dawn.Gabriel Fairchild is a hero returned home. He finds himself recovering from an injury that has left him blinded and his face horribly scarred. The piting glances and worries of his family are most intolerable and he soon finds himself alone in his country manner away from the prying eyes of the ton and relieved of the burden his disability places on his family. Only thing is he isn't fairing well on his own. Mistakes and bumbling sends him into fits of rage that causes his servants to tremble. He has long since given up niceties of society, and shunned even the light of day or a breathe of cleansing air.Samantha Wickersham is answering an ad in the London Times for a nurse. She endures a most disturbing interview in which she was treated to a marvelously violent tirade of our hero Gabriel. Strangely where most women would run in fear, Samantha stays. Could she have motives of her own?It was the feral behavior of Gabriel that drew me into the story. He was lead by his other senses, ferreting Samantha out simply by the smell of her. It was almost an animal scenting his mate. Very hot! And he was just awful to her, the hilarity of which was not lost.This is an excellent book. Being that I have read it twice, I was slightly bothered that there wasn't more foreshadowing in character development regarding Samantha Wickersham...but once you read the book you will understand what I mean.A good book to buy in addition to this one is The Lady Lies, by Samantha Saxon."},{"Title":"Yours Until Dawn","review":"I have always been a sucker for the \\"wounded hero\\" story. This one was fabulous to begin with, but with a plot twist that was so unexpected, it became an exceptional story. As many books as I have read I am always startled when an author can pull one over on me. Teresa Mediros certainly did. I thought with the book winding down that the plot was going to go in it typical direction, but it didn't! This was a great read, a beautiful story of courage and dealing with the unknown and finding one's self. I highly recommend.P.S. I know that everyone wants a happy ending..that's why we read the books, but just once I would like to read a story about the wounded hero that DOESN'T get better. It seems like they find out so much about themselves and who they are while they are ill, but stop as soon as they are cured.Just a thought."},{"Title":"Yours Until Dawn","review":"Gabriel Fairchild, Earl of Fairchild, has been blinded and left scarred during the war and is now a recluse in his country estate. Samantha Wickersham is hired by the Earl's father to nurse him back to health and civilization, but when Samantha arrives she finds Gabriel more beast than man. Determined to help him enter the world again, Samantha bullies him and encourages him to learn to live with his blindness.I loved this book. Even though the subject matter was grave, there were many touches of humor between Gabriel and Samantha that have you laughing out loud. Samantha was a wonderful heroine that you like right away. It takes a bit of time to feel more than sympathy for Gabriel although you can understand why he has shut himself off from the world. I have always loved Medeiros' books, but this one I think is one of her best."},{"Title":"Yours Until Dawn","review":"This homage to Beauty and the Beast is delightful. It's warm, funny, engaging and so tender that the end literally brought tears to my eyes. Teresa Medeiros' characters have always been her strongest point, and this novel offers two of the best romance protagonists I've encountered in some time. Samantha is particularly enchanting. She is determined, practical, thoroughly heroic. The plot doesn't offer many surprises--the rules of historical romance are straightforward. Nevertheless, Ms. Medeiros did manage to make me catch my breath in fear for a character I knew, realistically, could not die. And even though I've read enough of these boy-meets-girl books to know how they turn out, I was still flipping pages eagerly to catch the particulars of this one."},{"Title":"Yours Until Dawn","review":"I'm always into Smantha James, Lisa Kleypas or Cathy Maxwell's books, yet, once in a while I would like to have a little change in my taste, so I tried Teresa Medeiros's books for the 1st time. \\"Yours Until Dawn\\" was my 1st choice in her collection, and I was really surprised the way she gives each character a fun and witty personality. She made the story seemed so alive, that I didn't want it to end, even though I read the book for the 2nd time. They way she writes always makes me laugh then cry, then cry and laugh again. It's really a treat reading one of her books. I recommned to anyone who is into fairy tales, or just plain romance books, you will not be dissapointed."},{"Title":"Yours Until Dawn","review":"...but the end was a tad iffy.I'll start by saying Teresa Medeiros is an auto-buy author for me. I've rarely been disappointed in ANY of her work. This novel held me intrigued and played on my emotions up until the last few chapters, when a couple of plot twists took decidedly wrong turns -- in my humble opinion. I did see one of them coming, but another one totally threw me off. : (That said, this is still a great read by a talented writer. Characterization, prose, and dialogue are classic Medeiros. Her handling of a blind hero was exceptional."},{"Title":"Yours Until Dawn","review":"I also disagree with the editorial review from Publisher's Weekly- this was an excellent read!! It had alot of excitement, twists & turns that I stayed up most of the night to finish! Her characters were great together and I thoroughly enjoyed reading the love story between Sam & Gabriel. It was crisp to the end, & I never felt &quot;disoriented or cheated&quot;. You will enjoy this book from start to finish, and it is a definite keeper for me!"},{"Title":"Yours Until Dawn","review":"...but TM disappointed me in the end. Up until then I was loving the story, even though I figured out the \\"twist\\" very early on. I won't spoil the story, but suffice it to say that Gabriel does something toward the end that makes a mockery of his love for Samantha, and I was so distraught that I nearly couldn't finish it. So, five stars for most of the book, one star for the last part, and I went with the average. \\"Charming the Prince\\" is a much more satisfying read by this author."},{"Title":"Yours Until Dawn","review":"I'm so thankful that I read nothing about this book before reading it. The Kindle version even spared me from having to read back cover copy! I loved this book from start to finish, and did not see the plot twist coming until a page or two before it hit - and my reaction was not disappointment but envy (as an author) of how gorgeously Medieros set it up while still keeping me in the dark!"},{"Title":"Yours Until Dawn","review":"Must read romance. Not what you expect. One of my best books. One of those books that make you keep saying OMG!"},{"Title":"Yours Until Dawn","review":"In 1806 Samantha Wickersham accepts a job as nurse to angry Gabriel Fairchild, a naval veteran blinded in the battle that cost Nelson his life. Part of his ire with the world is how his fianc&eacute; reacted to his injuries as his beloved Cecily March, who encouraged him to fight, walked out on him in horror.Sam and Gabriel battle from the first day as he wants no one with him. To rid himself of her, Gabriel acts like a pest ringing for her constantly. Sam does his whims for a few days until she finally has had it and gives up. As Sam leaves, Gabriel tries to stop her, but hurts himself in an accident that almost kills him. She stays and soon they fall in love. However, she plans to leave once she feels he is back to what he once was because she has a secret that if revealed would lead to his hating her.This is an exciting Regency romance that follows the life of what today would be classified as a disabled vet as he struggles to return to civilian life believing he lost everything. Though at times Gabriel's behavior is understandable, it can be wearying to the reader almost as much as it is to Sam. Still the key to the tale is Sam's secret as Gabriel learns what real blindness is, providing a pleasant twist for readers.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Yours Until Dawn","review":"I could not get past the basic premise. A wealthy, distinguished war hero living in Regency England needs help coping with his blindness and they hire an inexperienced young woman to take care of him? Because there were no experienced, medically-trained veterans with experience dealing with war wounded to take care of him? So that's where I stopped reading."},{"Title":"Yours Until Dawn","review":"The synopsis relates the highlights of this story accurately so no need to re-hash it. Gabriel Fairchild, spoiled sophisticate and rakehell of the ton is ravaged by his longing for a life he believes is lost to him and the a debilitating injury that left him blind after serving in the Royal Navy. His family has engaged the services of nurse, Samantha Wickersham, to look after him at his childhood home while they wait for news advising if Gabriel would be able to recover. Samantha comes with her own secrets as she employs unorthodox therapies to help Gabriel, who does his best to resist Samantha's therapies and her charms.The pacing and serviceable storyline and follow the usual historical romance formula. While the plot has been used previously in other forms of literature it works here quite well. Both the primary and secondary characters are charming enough to make this a fairly interesting and humorous read. Also, I was surprisingly engaged with the sensuousness of the intimate scenes and interaction with the leads.While I found it a bit slow to begin with and guessed the big reveal well before it was announced - so no big surprises for me, I did enjoy my trip to the past."},{"Title":"Yours Until Dawn","review":"At the very beginning I found Samantha annoying but she grew out of it after a few chapters. Then the book became so good until near the end where the plot twist took place. I did not see it coming. The book did not make sense after finishing the book. I felt like I was tricked. Spoiler alert - how could Samantha be Cecily? There were no clues and it was like I was looking at two different people. It did not make sense. Samantha never acted like she knew Gabriel. It was all business. I am just really upset because the book was so good and had to be ruined by the plot twist. I felt she only cared about herself. He was looking all over for her and she continued to trick her. I will never read another book by this author again. She ruined a perfectly good book."},{"Title":"Yours Until Dawn","review":"it was just ok. now i don;t even remember how it ended so i guess i could not finish this book.the writing needs a little more work."},{"Title":"Yours Until Dawn","review":"I wanted to like this book. Back cover blurb promised a touching story about a blind nobleman and his determined nurse. The writing I glimpsed was clear and fun. But the characters and ensuing story was irritating beyond belief.Samantha was more petulant than helpful. She seemed to help her blind earl by baiting him then running off when he truly needed her. (Leaving him to nearly bleed to death on the floor, snarking at him to shoot himself when he was drunk and poised in his library looking for any meaning.)And by the time we get to her big secret, she ceased to have any redeeming qualities. Instead she came across as the same selfish little twit of a society girl we learned to hate in absentia. (She loves him let him love her then abandons him because she can never atone for her earlier abandonment.)Meanwhile we had a truly engaging hero in Gabriel. A man who's life is turned upside down by blindness and desperately needs a guardian angel to show him a new way of living. We even have fun background characters in the servants, family and that silly dog. He was a hero without a proper heroine.If this is an example of Medeiros' work, find another romance author. Her stuff is half baked at best."},{"Title":"Yours Until Dawn","review":"I guess I'm another odd one out because I thought the book was o.k. but I wouldn't read it again. I certainly didn't love it & I'm not really sure I can even say that I actually liked it. This is the 2nd book I've read from Teresa Medeiros & I will read more because the book Nobody's Darling was excellent. Along with the romance in books I also enjoy a little mystery & suspense & there just wasn't any in this book. It was just a little too slow to me & there wasn't much excitement. If a nice slow romance without any adventure is what you enjoy then certainly give it a try but if you want more then just a plan slow romance then find another read."},{"Title":"Yours Until Dawn","review":"Teresa Medeiros shot straight to the top of my auto-buy list the moment I read \\"A Kiss to Remember\\". Her backlist has ultimately charmed me, but her recent Avon releases; One Night of Scandal and this one have fallen way short of the TM charm.This book had plenty of promise; a beauty and the beast type premise(though, The Bride and the Beast used it as well), a blind, tortured hero, and a no-nonsense heroine. But it began to unravel fairly quickly after the first meeting between the hero and heroine. Gabriel came across as less of a tortured, \\"dark\\" hero and more of a petulant man whose care-free life was changed simply because he wasn't handsome anymore. Samantha was a great character up until the twist Medeiros put into the book(which, btw, I didn't see coming *g*).The cartoonish servants(why, oh why are servants in Regency historicals so darn friendly?), love scenes that were watered down versions of Medeiros' previous sensual, richly emotional love scenes of her past books, and a last section that erased all of the charm and wit of the majority of the book and sadly, I found myself regretting that I'd bought this book instead of waiting for my library to obtain it."},{"Title":"Yours Until Dawn","review":"Reviewed at Another Look Book ReviewsGreat deal for your Kindle. If an US resident Yours Until Dawn was free. If you're Canadian, Yours Until Dawn was still an amazing price of $2.19. I highly recommend this great limited time offer.Well I'll be honest and say that I purchased Yours Until Dawn because of that great deal I mention above. I follow Teresa Medeiros on Facebook and I read so many of her comments from her fans indicating that Yours Until Dawn was one of their favourites of her's so I got it. I can see why. I just loved it.I knew nothing of Yours Until Dawn as I didn't even read the book blurb. I had no idea what to expect but I do enjoy Teresa Medeiros' historicals so I knew with faith that it would be great. The writing was fabulous and highly descriptive. I adore the witty banter of conversation she orchestrates with her protagonists. Samantha and Gabriel entered into some simply awesome sparring moments and humourous comebacks. As Samantha was acting as Gabriel's nurse there were some laugh out loud moments that I want to go back and read. Loved it!I could really feel Gabriel's desperation with his blindness and all the emotional turmoil that twisted inside him. From the jilted finance that left him at the hospital to his adoring family thinking he'd been better off dead rather than suffer a disability like blindness. It was unsettling to read their ignorance.There is a twist to Yours Until Dawn that I admit I didn't see coming. I can usually sniff out the obvious and I was pleasantly surprised to be taken by surprise. I think I was so absorbed with the fabulous story,and by not taking a moment to put my Kindle down, that I didn't see it coming. What an amazing transformation these characters go through and it was a wonderful afternoon read. Outstanding! Now I want to turn around and re-read.Teasers: love letters, Sam the dog, \\"Before, you were only a dream. Now you're a dream come true\\""},{"Title":"Yours Until Dawn","review":"This book starts out with young nurse Samantha Wickersham at a job interview for the position of taking care of return soldier Gabriel Fairchild. Wounded at war, Gabriel is now blind and in a state of anger and despair. With two previous nurses leaving the job just as fast as they started it, Samantha knows she has her work cut out for her. Gabriel is stubborn, angry and throws tantrums throughout the house by way of shouting and breaking things. Samantha has a way of putting him in his place and she breaks through his pain by helping him adjust to his new blindness. Samantha is running from a secret from her own - with her secret being a great twist to the story.This is my first time reading Medeiros - and not my last. This is one of those books that you read in one sitting or stay up all night to finish. The banter back and forth between Gabriel and Samantha is so smart and well written. You can't help feel for Gabriel in this book - he was left at the hospital by his finance and his mother feels it would have been better if he died in the war. I think what I really loved about this book was the love that Gabriel's household staff had for him. His family left him in a large secluded mansion to live out the rest of his life, so the staff and his new nurse became his family.Most readers will figure out Samantha's secret early on, but I think this adds to the book. If you don't figure it out, I guarantee you will be flipping back pages to reread certain parts of the beginning. There is only one part in this book that prevented me from giving it an A+, but it's a spoiler so I can't reveal it in this review.This book ended up being a wonderful surprise, so glad I read it. I promise you it will make you laugh out loud and shed a tear or two."},{"Title":"Yours Until Dawn","review":"Even though the premise of the book is rather formulaic (Gee, I wonder what happens when a dashing but wounded serviceman is nursed by a lovely young woman, hmm?), I did enjoy the surly earl and could understand that it is not unreasonable for him to behave in that manner, being that it was only 6 months since the initial injury. However, I'm going to have to go with the minority on this one. I enjoy plot twists and am actually quite pleased when I am surprised. However, as I closed in on the middle of the book, a nagging suspicion crept in and all I kept thinking was \\"please no.\\" It was an unfortunate yes and that tidbit was quite disappointing. I would have been fine if the storyline stayed the course and avoided that \\"twist\\". Anything but the conclusion that it was.If I could remove a couple elements of the book, I'd give it 4.5 stars. The writing was well done. I could imagine the mustiness of the air, the dark cavernous ambiance of the rooms, and the beastly earl and his growls. I came to like the earl and the servants. But the twist took away from all that. And for that, I give this 3 stars."},{"Title":"Yours Until Dawn","review":"This was a great read - interesting plot, fast paced from beginning to end, funny banter between the hero and heroine, great steam scenes, and wonderful character development. I won't summarize the plot since others have done so, but although I could guess who Samantha really was before it was revealed, it was still a great ride getting there. No complaints at all; looking forward to reading more books by this author."},{"Title":"Yours Until Dawn","review":"My first read by Teresa Medeiros.

And still, today when I was browsing through our local library, I was totally intrigued with the plot synopsis written on the back cover of this book. And I wasn't disappointed.Gabriel was a wonderful (tortured) hero. On the outside, he was harsh, bitter, and arrogant, but on the inside, he was lonely, vulnerable and in a hopeless need of love. I loved the way Samantha was slowly making him accept his blindness and adjust to a new way of living. And the way he gradually, reluctantly learned to live in darkness. I enjoyed watching the love between them grow.What I didn't like, however, was the ending. ***spoiler warning*** It was rushed and had me feeling that something was missing. It would take at least 10 more pages to let Gabriel adjust to the though that Samantha and Cecily were the same person, to accept her betrayal (because that's what it was) and make everything right again. And I didn't like the fact that Gabriel made love to Cecily although he fancied himself in love with Samantha. I want my heroes to be faithful - and even though they were one and the same woman, he didn't know it. Despite these faults I'm still giving this book 5 stars - it's been a long time since I wasn't able to put a book down:)"},{"Title":"Yours Until Dawn","review":"This book is a bit different. A story line of a man who loses his site and his love. Without giving away a HUGE twist in the story, which rocked....

The ending caught me quite unawares. As with most of Ms. Medeiros' books, the characters are real and likeable, one in which the reader can lose himself or herself in the plot and settings and character dialogue. I lOVED it, and have bought copies to give to my friends!"},{"Title":"Yours Until Dawn","review":"On the basis that I've rather enjoyed the last two romance novels by Teresa Medeiros, she's almost become an &quot;I-have-to-read-her-latest&quot; with me. And halfway into the first chapter, I knew that my instincts to read &quot;Yours Until Dawn&quot; at once was sound: it was a good and worthwhile read. The plot may be a much used one, but Ms Medeiros' take on this old storyline was enjoyable, satisfying and almost unique.Handsome beyond permission, charming and exceedingly rich, Gabriel Fairchild was, once, a much sought after bachelor. But that was before he was blinded and scarred in battle, and before he was abandoned by both his family and the young woman he adored. Now, the proud and bitter young man lives in darkness and seclusion at his country estate, alone (save for his servants), and taking out his anger on harmless pieces of furniture and china. But all that changes when his father hires a new nurse to help him cope with his blindness. Prim and capable Samantha Wickersham knew that she had her work cut out for her. After all it cannot be easy for a young and vital young man, used to leading an active life, to have to cope with blindness. But she hadn't counted on the amount of anger and bitterness that Gabriel would feel. Or that he had put all good manners and civilized behaviour behind him and was now leading the life of an arrogant barbarian. But if Gabriel thought that he could chase his latest nurse away with bad manners and curses, he didn't know Samantha at all. Determined to help Gabriel cope with his blindness and to show him that he can still lead a full and vital life, Samantha vows not to allow Gabriel to get the better of her. And so the battle of wills begins. Who will win? The arrogant and bitter young lord or his patient and determined nurse?The storyline of &quot;Yours Until Dawn&quot; is actually a much used one -- a young nurse appears to help the wounded beast-hero, and in the process tames and wins his heart. And while &quot;Yours Until Dawn&quot; doesn't depart very much from this basic format, what I liked about it, aside from Ms Meideiros' clever way of engaging my interest from the very beginning and making me care for both Gabriel and Samantha and for their happily ever-after ending, was the fact that the authour took the time and effort to map out the clash of wills between Gabriel and Samantha and to chart the developing romance between the two in a credible and believable manner. That's what made &quot;Yours Until Dawn&quot; a stellar read. Magical, passionate and touching (though not in a cringingly syrupy way) , &quot;Yours Until Dawn&quot; was a very enjoyable and satisfying read, and truly worthy of a 5 star rating."},{"Title":"Yours Until Dawn","review":"Gabriel was blinded in battle while fighting for his country and becomes a bitter man living as a hermit with his servants. Samantha becomes his nurse to try to help him cope with his blindness. They fight and bicker, but most of the time it's enduring. Both characters have moments of amusing childishness and annoying selfishness but the story is solid and there are some really sweet moments. Watching Gabriel struggle with his blindness and seeing the unbelievable patience Samantha had with him was heartwarming.Yours Until Dawn had such wonderful promises. For over three-fourths of the book I was hanging onto every sentence, every word, just waiting to see what would happen. Then, complete and utter disappointment.Up until around page 259 this book had a 4.5 star rating written all over it. Then it seem to just abruptly end and become a completely different story with a different plot and different characters with the same name. Samantha's surprise didn't make any sense whatsoever. It was all pointless.Gabriel's \\"recovery\\", while good news, was disappointing. I felt as if the author had to 'fix' him before a real relationship could form with him and Samantha. I felt as if that implied there was something wrong with him to start with. His parents had treated him like an invalid and they never did completely accept his blindness, but they were the most doting parents when everything worked out! It just felt hollow.Samantha. Good grief. The most horrible woman I have ever read. Selfish and cruel and way too bossy. She had \\"too little, too late\\" written all over her and I felt that Gabriel was a complete idiot for staying with her. She loved him, left him, then loved him, and left him. Now, don't get me wrong, I love the beta heroes. The all-around nice guys who aren't domineering and cruel but in the end Gabriel seem whipped. He didn't even get angry when he found out her little secret. But his letter to her at the end was very well written and so very sweet. I just wished it had been written for someone else.I understand rabid fans will not like critical reviews and will most likely give this a low rating, but trust me. If you MUST read this book, then please stop at the weak 'plot-twist' and just make up your own ending."},{"Title":"Yours Until Dawn","review":"I've been an avid reader of romance since I was thirteen. (No, it wasn't all THAT long ago, but long enough!) That being said, I've read a LOT of books, and I've seen the whole spectrum from the stinkers to the sensational. Lately, I was starting to despair of ever reading a good romance again, as I seemed to be finding only the stinkers.Then I read this book, and it blew me away! It had me wondering why on earth it took me so many years to discover this author. She was absolutely amazing! When I read the back cover description, I thought this would just be another \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" story, but it was so much more than that. A truly talented author is one who can take an old plot and make it fresh and interesting. Medeiros does it in this winner.Both the hero and the heroine were people you could cheer for. Samantha had just the right balance of the \\"tough love\\" with Gabriel while still knowing when the soft touch was needed. And while he was a suffering hero, he was so much more than just the stereotypical handsome brooding man. Many men in his situation end up being so annoying that you want to smack them one. With Gabriel, he had just enough angst without being overly melancholic--he didn't stay stuck in his sorrow for long. I really felt like I knew the characters. I felt their emotions deeply, and got tears in my eyes when they were torn apart.And the secondary characters were wonderful as well. The author made them well-rounded, loveable people without focusing so much on them that they distracted from the main plot.While I could see the plot twist coming before it was revealed (I'm not going to give it away), it did not detract from my enjoyment of the book at all.I devoured this novel in a day. For a speedreader who reads 200+ novels a year, finding a \\"can't put it down\\" book is rare. But I had to stay up late until the wee hours finishing this. I knew I'd never sleep until it was done.This was the kind of book that you can't stop reading, yet you'll feel sad when it's over, simply because there's nothing more to read. It's also a book that you'll close and immediately press to your heart with a smile on your face before putting it on your keeper shelf. I don't give out many five star ratings (I find far more books that I don't like than ones I like), but this book really earned it. I will be looking for more books by this author, as she is wonderful - right up there with Mary Jo Putney, Jacquie D'alessandro, and Mary Balogh."},{"Title":"Yours Until Dawn","review":"Ms. Medeiros delievers yet again with her latest historical set in England in the early 1800's. This was a sweet read with great chemistry between the two main characters Gabriel and Samantha.Gabriel was wounded during the a battle that took Admiral Nelson's life aboard the \\"Victory\\". Left blind he returns home a \\"hero\\" in the eyes of many, but a monster in his own blind eyes. Living as a beast in his own country estate he has vowed never to let sunlight touch his face again. Little does he know his life is about to change for the better with the help of his new, but determined nurse Samantha Wickersham.Samantha arrives at Fairchild Park knowing that her job won't be easy, but determined not to fail. She has a secret that won't let her fail. What she doesn't count on are the strong feelings that Gabriel brings out in her heart. Still, despite Gabriel's surly nature she starts to bring sunlight back into Gabriel's and maybe just a little bit of magic as well into her own.Together they realize that sometimes you have to look beyond what's right in front of you to what's really there. Can a strong love grow from a certain tragedy?This was a very sweet romance that was a pleasure to read. Ms. Medeiros latest offering will touch on all of your emotions and will bring the reader both tears and laughter. This was not a sensual read, but rather a sweet and romantic read. There are plenty of twists and turns as well as a secret that Samantha has that helps drive the plot of the story. This is a read that I highly recommend."},{"Title":"Yours Until Dawn","review":"I love beauty and the beast themed novels, so the idea of a woman nursing a blind war hero back to the land of the living was wonderful. I loved that he learned to deal with his disablity while falling in love with the heroine. Then bam! The whole plot switches. It was almost like two different books. I can't go into too much with out giving everthing away, but everything that was presented a certain way was not actually true. The hero claims to love the heroine but lusts after a woman he says he hates, while loving heroine.(This will make sense if you read it) I adored the first half of the book. It was shaping up to be one of my all time favorites. Then the author makes you second guess who the characters really are. Do we really know them after all? The author also took the easy way out with the heroes disability. Overall, this book is worth reading from the library but not worthy of paying for. I wish I had just skipped the last 40 pages. Even though it ended happily it left a bad taste in my mouth."},{"Title":"Yours Until Dawn","review":"Loved this book! It was fun, sensual, full of wit & sweet. Sam and Gabriel were well matched. I did not feel cheated. I repeat, I DID NOT FEEL CHEATED by the ending whatsoever! Many times I will read a book, while being greatly satisfying, am a little disappointed with the ending of it. Not so with Yours Until Dawn. It was great all the way!!!Teresa Medeiros has been a favorite of mine since her first book. I've read them all. Her last one(One Night of Scandal)was alittle disappointing for me but she really made up for it with this one. Selfish aren't I. I just expect the best out of Ms. Medeiros and she delivered with this one. She ranks up there with Christina Dodd, Connie Brockway,Sabrina Jeffries, Laura Lee Guhrke, just to mention a few. Auto-buy for me. Read it in just one morning. Get it.Any way you can(Sorry amazon, I order books thru the library)"},{"Title":"Yours Until Dawn","review":"This is the second book I've read by Teresa Medeiros- I think I have a new favorite author. As you can see, there's not as much detail in the reviews for this one, because there's quite a twist in the story line- which, if revealed, would kinda ruin the read. Several reviewers have said it's kind of an old plot line, but I think Medeiros really adds enough to make it her own. Gabriel saves Samantha's life, and Samantha saves Gabriel's. It seems simple enough, but Samantha isn't the typical timid mouse you come to expect from the women in these kind of romances, she's strong willed, and able to put Gabriel in his place, matching his banter tit for tat. Samantha's brave enough to deliver Gabriel's mother,a prestigious member of the ton, a scalding rebuke (better than even a slap in the face, because his mother thinks she's just his nurse), without batting an eyelash. You think it can't get any better, and then BAM! Medeiros busts out with a very unexpected plot twist. It was a solid historical romance by, I think, a very accomplished writer. A MUST READ!"},{"Title":"Yours Until Dawn","review":"This was the first book I read from Teresa Medeiros, and I loved it so much that I've since read several more of hers. I know other readers have said this isn't her best work, but I found all of her others disappointing in comparison to this one.This was the first of her heroines that I really liked. Her other stories were pretty good, and very sweet, but the females tended to grate on my nerves. Not so in \\"Yours Until Dawn.\\" I enjoyed how the heroine was neither \\"in your face\\" or meek. She spirited/spunky without being precocious and immature.I have always been partial to Beauty and the Beast stories, which probably explains why I enjoyed this so much. The \\"obvious twist\\" that others referred to wasn't terribly obvious to me, although in hindsight I suppose it was pretty silly of me to miss what was going on. Nonetheless, it was a pleasent surprise that added to the Beauty and the Beast tale rather than detracting from it.I would definetly recommend this book. It's rare for me to pick up an unfamiliar author and be so thoroughly charmed, so perhaps I'd suggest this book most for those not familiar with Medeiros' other works. I thought this to be better than her other stories, but if you're a diehard fan of her books, you might not enjoy this one as much as it read a bit differently."},{"Title":"Yours Until Dawn","review":"\\"Will you still love me when those lips are puckered not in passion, but with age? Will you love me when my eyes are faded, but my affections for you undimmed?\\"Maybe it's because I've been reading so many Regencies lately, and they tend to all read alike after awhile, but \\"Yours Until Dawn\\" is a Regency that really stands out from the crowd. The writing, is as usual for Teresa Medeiros, really beautiful, the story is one that has been done before, but this one is done better, with a different twist, and in general, is a different kind of story, for someone who is looking for something different set in a Regency era.I have to admit that I was hesitant about this book to start. I always love Teresa Medeiros, she writes beautifully, but I was a little worried about the \\"blind hero\\" theme, since I don't generally like a sad story, plus I find it rare that an author can do this realistically and still make a romance. I needn't have worried. This was not only realistically done, but beautifully done as well, with just the right blend of sweet and sour, funny and sad, for a beautiful and heartwarming read, and a story that stays with you long after you turn the last page.I even liked all the plot twists (look, you have to make it a little different to make it interesting), and I even liked the ending. Sure, it's a little too much happily-ever-after - but this is make believe, not real life, after all - and we all need an unbelievable, too-good-to-be-true ending for our forays into dream world.Although when this book starts off it seems like it will be a re-make of Beauty and the Beast, there is a twist to this story that turns the original story and stands it on its head. I have noticed that Ms. Medeiros generally does use fairy tales as her starting point for many of her stories, but this story does go into it's own direction, this is without a doubt an original story, and beautifully written as well.I absolutely recommend this book, without any reservations, with \\"Yours Until Dawn\\" I think Teresa Medeiros has written her best book yet. So if you like Regencies, or if you like this author, you will definitely *love* this book. I can't recommend this book highly enough, it's a gem in every way. Thank you, Ms. Medeiros!"},{"Title":"Yours Until Dawn","review":"This has been my favorite Medeiros book so far! She captures your interest from the very first page. I won't take the time to outline the plot since others have done such a good job of it, but I will say that it has some twists that will pleasantly surprise the reader. I highly recommend this book because of its originality and absence of formulaic characters. Ms. Medeiros characters breathe with life and don't spout any prosaic nonsense. They have life and vitality and earn the readers sympathy in every book of hers that I have read. What sets this one apart is its original and creative premise. I thought that it would be resolved in a trite manner, but I was pleasantly surprised by the plot twists and its conclusion. I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves a happy ending."},{"Title":"Yours Until Dawn","review":"No spoiler here. I did, however, work out this plot twist fairly early on might be the 1000's of books I read therefore, I was with Teresa M from day one. Extremely good book! I enjoy a little heartbreak in my romantic fiction, it is fiction after all. I also enjoyed the supporting cast. Family as well as The Help. Reread this easily and enjoyed it just as much as I did the first time. Teresa Medeiros is a favorite author, even if I may never remember how to spell Teresa nor Medeiros! Teresa can spell historical romantic fiction extremely well. Enjoy the book!"},{"Title":"Yours Until Dawn","review":"There is lots of heart in this novel. The humor and drama are nicely set out for moments of laughter and quiet moments for tears and most importantly, an overwhelming urge to see both characters overcome their troubles and realize that they are meant to be together.Full length novel about Gabriel and Samantha. Gabriel goes into the Navy to impress a girl who finds him trivial. He works his way up the ranks through hardwork and becomes a good soldier and a solid man but loses his sight due to an injury. He becomes reclusive because he is ashamed of his injury, hates life and is depressed over what could have been. Samantha is full of secrets but helps Gabriel accept his situation and finds creative ways to make his life easier.Eventually, they fall for each other quite sweetly. There is humor, tears, betrayal and passion. There is also great montage of letters between Gabriel and the girl he was trying to impress, that is beautifully woven into the story. The sizzle level is pretty mild and the ending was not very satisfying, but overall this is a heartwarming story of young love and true love."},{"Title":"Yours Until Dawn","review":"The hero is blind and that in itself is unique for me. There are probably other romance books out there that have a blind hero but up to this point, I haven't read any. And I loved his personality. Very sarcastic and witty and yet I did not see his character as contrived (probably due to his blindness). He still carried the self confidence of a man that was used to being blessed and could not adjust to his current state of helplessness. I found him extremely endearing. The heroine stood out for me from the beginning because of her intelligence, bravery and quick wit. I could identify with her strength and her refusal to pity him. Gabriel did not intimidate her, which turned out to be the best thing for him. I love the way she felt the need to atone for walking away from him when he was first injured. TM did an excellent job giving the reader insight into what drove Samantha to follow her first impulse and also what led her to seek redemption. I love when the author lets you get inside the character's head and explains what makes them unique. The banter between the hero and heroine was classic. I loved it! Both the hero and the heroine were top notch which is rare for me. The plot was different and yet intriguing and the ending totally caught me off guard. Wonderful. I really enjoyed this book."},{"Title":"Yours Until Dawn","review":"I didn't want to stop reading this book. Yours Until Dawn left a smile on my face all day. Great character development and a realistic relationship between the hero and heroine based on depth of feelings rather than physical attraction."},{"Title":"Yours Until Dawn","review":"This is my first venture into Teresa Medeiros, and for the most part, I liked what I read. I agree the twist is a little hard to swallow but either I've become immune to bad writing or Teresa is just that good of a writer, because I believed in the story. Definitely looking forward to more of her books."},{"Title":"Yours Until Dawn","review":"A host of memorable characters and a story that seems predictable until Ms Medeiros throws in some twists and turns. It is impossible not to fall in love with Gabriel. i rarely finish a book and wish to begin it again immediately. This was such a book. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Yours Until Dawn","review":"This is a very enjoyable book. Its written in that old 1800's english langauge which is lovely. The main character is wounded in war time and rejected by his fiance. That same woman who is unable to face him scarred and blinded takes on another identity to nurse him back to health. Once she suceeds and gets him mentally and physically healthy she disappears and reappears as his long lost fiance. Gabriel realizes that the two women he loves are the same woman. Cecily explains to Gabriel why she told so many lies and they admit how much they love each other. Its really lovely. I don't like the lies but, she was afraid to admit the truth to him. It makes sense in a weird sort of way."},{"Title":"Yours Until Dawn","review":"I fell in love with the earl. This story reminded me of all the reasons why I read romance. The heroine is a bit manipulative. But the story has a good twist to it."},{"Title":"Yours Until Dawn","review":"Yours until Dawn is a fantastic read. It will go by fast and leave you wanting more. A book that you can see play out in your mind. This is a great book to share and read out loud. Lots of laughs."},{"Title":"Yours Until Dawn","review":"I liked this story. There was humor in it and characters that were enjoyable. Medeiros is becoming one of my favorite authors.Defintely worth reading."},{"Title":"Yours Until Dawn","review":"Gabriel Fairchild lost his sight from a blow to his head while serving aboard a naval ship under Lord Nelson. His fianc&eacute;e abandoned him and his family forced his seclusion in their country estate. Gabriel has become rather beastly and difficult until his new nurse, Samantha Wickersham, shows up to restore order and hope to the household. She also matches him in wit and willfulness, teaching him to adapt to his sightlessness.You just know from the start that things are going to be interesting between these two. Gabriel was considered to be extremely handsome and seductive before his injury so his change in lifestyle was also a serious blow to his self esteem. It's also obvious that Samantha is hiding something so there's a bit of intrigue. But mostly, it's the relationship and banter between Gabriel and Samantha that makes this story special. There's a lot to like about both of them and their passion is exciting. The entire household staff becomes engaged in Samantha's tactics, providing humor as they seek to transform Gabriel.This is a delightful story with a steamy romance, a bit of intrigue and a large share of funny moments. This is my first book by this author and I plan to read more of her titles."},{"Title":"Yours Until Dawn","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It (to me) is a version of Beauty and the Beast - one of my favorite fairy tales.

I loved this book from the beginning to the end. You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Yours Until Dawn","review":"Have read others with same genre, but this one was different enough to enjoy the story. Very well written.Thank you Teresa"},{"Title":"Yours Until Dawn","review":"Liked the plot, loved the character development, enjoyed the unveiling of the mystery, liked Samantha's strength of character and most of the decisions she made, and happily went for a second reading of the book soon as I'd finished, to see everything in light of the interesting revelations towards the end. The story reminded me of a beloved old classic, &#34;Rosary&#34;, where, perhaps more realistically, there is no miraculous regaining of the hero's sight. I especially enjoyed the author's style and dry wit and look forward to reading her other work."},{"Title":"Yours Until Dawn","review":"I was almost one third of my way into the story when I figured out what was going on. Very well done. Especially the parts where certain people - his mother (Is she an unfeeling harpy?) - discovered things about themselves they'd rather not acknowledge in the light of day, or have another - the nurse (Who is she really?) - bring to the light of day. Our H and H had courage. Honesty. Integrity. They had selflessness and compassion to spare. They were also stubborn, willful, and tireless in the pursuit of their goals. Without those traits our Hero would never have had the strength or want or will to experience the joy, love and laughter our Heroine brought into his life. They were perfect for each other."},{"Title":"Yours Until Dawn","review":"This book had all the ingredients to make a good read, yet something was missing. I love a suffering hero, spunky heroine, colorful secondary cast of characters and an intriguing plot - and this novel had all of the above. Still...it didn't have the ability to pull me into the book and join their world. Somehow I remained a bystander, skeptically watching the drama enfold, but never tempted to invest myself in their story - despite my best efforts.Perhaps it was the timing. Certain aspects of the story seemed rushed, not given enough time for the ingredients to blend. Seems like the \`beast' is tamed much too quickly. Seems like they are attracted to each other without any real reason except proximity. Seems like the hero's family is introduced only to further the plot. Just didn't seem quite realistic.Starts out with our hero, blinded and scarred in a naval battle, embittered and reclusive who retreats to his country estate to wallow in self-pity and despair. Enter the heroine, a nurse hired by his father to replace the succession of caretakers before her who have quit in disgust, anger or fear. The household servants have abandoned their household duties and the estate is unkempt, matching their master's foul temper. So far, so good.Enter the new nurse, determined to ease his circumstances in spite of his reluctance. Before you know it, she has rearranged the house, enlisted the help of the servants, tamed the beast and is enormously attracted to the hero. There is no slow, sizzling build up of sensual tension, no real getting acquainted, no suspense. Admittedly, there were a great deal of opportunities for the story to develop and simmer, but it just didn't.And then, from nowhere, his family arrives. I found it impossible to discern if the family was loving, cruel, grieving or aggrieved. Did they love him or were they simply embarrassed by the encumbrance he created for them? Frankly, I didn't much care. They were introduced to create a scene - and they did. At which point, the hero stumbles out of doors (blind, don't forget) by himself and wanders off into the woods. I know this is a novel - but some plot devices are entirely too ridiculous and this was one. And, it got even more unbelievable as the scene unfolded.I would not have finished the book, except so many other reviewers mentioned they didn't like the ending. My curiosity won and I finished the book. Oddly, I found the final third of the book delightful. I won't give it away, but the ending was clever and quite skillful. If only the first two-thirds had been the same.....Sorry, overall 3 stars, barely - and only because of the ending."},{"Title":"Yours Until Dawn","review":"Another great read from Teresa Medeiros. Lots of humor and a strong female lead. Nice plot twist, even if I did see it coming from a mile away. Definitely recommend!"},{"Title":"Yours Until Dawn","review":"Very, very good! There was a twist I never saw coming, but the ending left me a little bit unsatisfied.I'll definitely check more of Teresa Medeiros' books out."},{"Title":"Yours Until Dawn","review":"In this wonderful historical romance, Medeiros takes the classic Beauty &the Beast story, changes it enough so that it's not quite the same old tale and then adds a twist. She removes the magical elements and replaces them with reality. Gabriel's infirmities are due to war is a little of that, as well). Is it predictable? In some ways yes, but not in a bad way, in a comfortable, enjoyable way. In other ways, no, it was still able to surprise me. At it's heart, it's a good old fashioned historicainjuries not magical enchantments, his \\"beastliness\\" more one of character than of physicality (though there l romance with headstrong, likeable main characters, just the right amount of tension and angst, and a whole lot of romance."},{"Title":"Yours Until Dawn","review":"I hesitate to read historical romances involving the \\"London Elite\\" due to the fact that alot of the male characters have one or more mistresses, as well as a wife, & they usually flaunt their mistresses in front of their wives. Not my idea of pleasurable reading.This is my first book by Teresa Medeiros, & the \\"Pleasant surprise\\" is the fact that mistresses were not a big issue in this story. I liked the chemistry between Gabriel and Samantha. I enjoyed reading this story even though there were a few tense scenes, as well as one scene that I would have preferred it not be in this story-- I felt that it took a little away from the idea of Gabriel's devotion to Samantha (however,there is another way of viewing that scene, but I won't mention it because it may spoil part of the story). All in all, these scenes did fit the story setting, while they were not the main focus of the story.I, like other reviewers, was caught unaware by the plot twist. But I found \\"Yours Until Dawn\\" to be emotional and sweet with just enough humor to make it a refreshing historical romance.I agree that I would have liked a little more substance to the ending, but overall, it was a good ending, and a good story."},{"Title":"Yours Until Dawn","review":"I disagree with the publishers weekly review. I loved the book from beginning to end. I kept the book and have read it more than once. I liked the surprising twist. And I liked Gabriel, Samantha and Cecily!?It is worth the read."},{"Title":"Yours Until Dawn","review":"Yours Until Dawn is an enchanting novel about a nurse, Samatha Wickersham, and Gabriel Fairchild, a man left scarred and blinded from war.The banter and encounters with each other throughout the book are wonderful. The wit made me laugh out loud many times. Out of all the romance books I've read, in which some you like the heroine more than the hero and vice versa, Samantha and Gabriel are two of the most well drawn out characters, and I liked them equally. I grew to love these characters, and they are definitely two of my favorites ever.The big 'surprise twist' near the end I figured out pretty early in the book, but it shocked me still the same because I was hoping it wasn't the case, but alas, it was. While it kind of jolted the book off it's path, the end almost made up for it, but I still think it would have been a better book if TM hadn't written that part. Still, on the whole it's a terrific book.Yours Until Dawn will keep you up way past bedtime, as it did with me, so I'd recommend starting it early as you will not be able to put it down. A wonderful, touching book. Magical!4.5/5 stars"},{"Title":"Yours Until Dawn","review":"This book reminded me of Beauty and the Beast, through and through. Minus a few plot differances.

I a huge fan of Teresa Medeiros and usually love her books (except One Night of Scandal), this book was no exception. I enjoyed the relationship that grew between Gabriel and Samantha.Possible SPOILER: However, I agree with the review from BookMom....the end made me a little uncomfortable. I felt that Gabriel's love for Samantha was diminished somewhat at the end. I wish he had received the information and put the situation together in his mind before the ball. I hate to think he was swayed so much after claiming his undying love for Samantha."},{"Title":"Yours Until Dawn","review":"Again Teresa Medeiros enthralls us , with her wonderfully written tale ..Gabriel and Samantha are the perfect foil for each other.

In fact, I will admit to missing my lunch, as I could not put it down until the end .. Teresa , we thank you.. Indulge and be delighted !!"},{"Title":"Yours Until Dawn","review":"I have two problems with this book. First it is a typical formulaic romance novel. It has all the predictable plot, action and characters. There is a nice surprise twist to the end, but there is nothing special, creative or delighting throughout the book. I almost feel like it was written by a computer with all the proper ingredients. My second problem is with the girl. Although the author described the girl as a coward, I found the girl's actions to be cruel. I couldn't get past the hurts she caused Gabriel. When she first saw him in the hospital, she ran away. After they found love together, she ran away again. He suffered and searched for her for months. Finally he gave up the search and decided to rejoin the Navy. She let him suffer far too long before she was willing to tell him the truth. This cruelty overshadowed the rest of the story for me."},{"Title":"Yours Until Dawn","review":"I've had a sick child and been dealing with depressing things for days and then I picked up this book and read it in one setting. this is the kind of book that you buy romances for. It was so great, sweet and sexy at the same time -- I just loved it. Buy it!"},{"Title":"Yours Until Dawn","review":"This story was very good up to a point. Medeiros did very well with the \\"tortured hero that's saved by the love of the right woman\\" theme. Gabriel was a wonderfully developed male lead, definately swoon worthy. And Samantha was really good at putting him in his place when needed and giving him care and understanding when needed. But here's a teensy spoiler... there is just the DUMBEST, most contrived twist at the end and it pretty much ruined my enjoyment of the story. It totally ruined what was turning out to be a beautifully contructed relationship between Gabriel and Samantha. To read something by Medeiros at her best I suggest checking out \\"Charming the Prince.\\""},{"Title":"Yours Until Dawn","review":"Both hero and heroine were intriguing in this twisted tale, slightly like Beauty and the Beast. Beast is our wounded hero Gabriel Fairchild. His love for the beauteous Cecily led him to enlist in the Royal Navy and then led to his wounding and blindness. No one could love him now... not his family, not his Cecily and he raged against them all in his remote family home.Then our Beauty, a mysterious nurse enters his life. Miss Samantha Wickersham doggedly goads Gabriel to make something of himself for those who did not return from war. She practically pulls the gun from his hand when doctors continued to tell him there was no hope of regaining his sight. He listens to her stand up against his visiting family, he admires her tenacious spirit, and he works to become all he once was.Gabriel (with a little collie Sam) repays Samantha by saving her life. Later, after a night of passion and the realization that Gabriel's sight was returning, Miss Wikersham disappears from his bed and his life. Though desperately in love, Samantha knows she cannot stay with him.But this plot is twisted and I will not spoil it for you. Can there be a happy ever after? Not the typical wounded hero theme. There is much more to this storyline. The secondary characters from servants to family add wonderful depth and reality to this novel. Medeiros has not disappointed me yet and this book is well worth picking up."},{"Title":"Yours Until Dawn","review":"I loved this book. I read it in one evening and disappointed when it ended.

I'd become a bit disappointed in the novels I had been picking up lately. In fact I had been taking days, even weeks to finish a boo, until this one. I just could NOT PUT IT DOWN! As soon as I started reading I could not stop. THe story begins immediately and sucks you right in. THe only way I will describe the story is somewhat like Disney's Beauty and the Beast. We never really know until later on in the book that our heroine, Samantha is beautiful (after all this is a romance novel, would she be anything but?). But the book contains a scene that reminded me perfectly of the part where Belle is trying to get the Beast to eat his porridge with a spoon rather than slobbering like an animal. THere was also the butler and the housekeeper, who reminded me of Potsworth and Mrs. Potts. I mean the story is just truly touching and the ending our two characters come to in the end is perfect. Thank you Ms. Medeiros for giving us this wonderful story.I laughed and I cried and I thouroughly enjoyed reading the love story between Sam and Gabriel!"},{"Title":"Yours Until Dawn","review":"Teresa Medeiros if one of my favorite authors. Often her novels ring with powerful emotion. Occasionally she does miss the mark. I enjoyed this book, but it's not my favorite. While I liked both of the characters and though the author did a wonderful job of writing, I never became emotionally attached to the lead characters.Samantha's secret actually detracted from the book for me. Her transformation did not ring true. Actually, it was only as her secret began to unfold that I became uneasy with the story. I had really enjoyed the book until then, but at that point, it became too easy, too pat a resolution.It's a good book but flawed, in my opinion."},{"Title":"Yours Until Dawn","review":"If you love Johanna Lindsey, Judith Mcnaught and Jude Deveraux,Than you must read Teresa Medeiros.I have waited a long time for a great new author and I have found her."},{"Title":"Yours Until Dawn","review":"In fact, I am like one of the others that wrote..That I was sick of romances and taking forever to read them...but as a true historical addict...I keep picking them up.I am so happy I picked this one up...read it all in one day... and was happy.

Samantha the nurse tries to help Gabriel the aristocrat, learn to live with the blindness caused by his war wounds. Everybody's likeable and it's all pretty predictable, but the story doesn't really suffer because of it. It is a mild tale of discovery and overcoming life's obstacles. This is one of those tales where things go pretty smoothly from bad to better with fairy tale ease. The story lacks the gritty feel of reality, which makes it perfect for those times when you've had enough reality and just want to spend a quiet afternoon with a book."},{"Title":"Yours Until Dawn","review":"and I usually LOVE Teresa Medeiros' plot twists - not this one.I definitely had to stay up all night reading this one to figure out how it ends.SPOILER: I would've loved if he got over the ex and if Samantha was a different girl, then he gets his sight back. Or if he gets his sight back and reconciles with her without getting a letter from the butler. too odd. Not AS sizziling as say \\"Bride and the Beast\\" but I still liked it."},{"Title":"Yours Until Dawn","review":"What in the world was Teresa Medeiros thinking when she wrote this book? I have read many other books by this author and have been delighted by them. This one made me so upset and angry that I've waited two days to write this review. Every time I think of the way this plot twisted (and then twisted again) I get mad, and I feel cheated. The only way this author could have been more successful in writing about things I REALLY don't want in the plot of a Regency novel would have been for her to get my complete list. She did manage to leave out a few of my all time no-no's but not enough so that you would notice.I began to read the book (without any idea of what it was about) and was thinking that it was going very well. Then I began to wonder why no background information was given for Miss Samantha Wickersham. The book continued, Samantha (the nurse) was making inroads into the torment and self-pity suffered by Gabriel Fairchild (the blind patient) and gradually bringing him back into the realm of the human being. Still no background information except for things such as Samantha saying \\"my sister\\" or \\"my parents\\". Samantha won over the hearts of all the servants with her concern for her patient, who had been blinded while trying to save the life of Admiral Lord Nelson aboard ship during a naval battle. I did not rebel at all when the two lead characters began to be attracted to each other, after all, that's why I read romantic fiction. Then, the whole thing went to pieces.I will give Ms Medeiros credit, I NEVER saw that plot twist coming. I just wish she could have resisted temptation and not done it in the first place. If you want to read a story about a shallow, self-centered, cowardly heroine, this is the book for you. And Samantha doesn't learn from her mistakes (in my opinion) because she compounds the mistake by making the whole list of them all over again! And, I absolutely cannot stand it when an author has a man vow that he is so much in love with one woman that there can never be another in his life (after all, he is supposedly diligently trying to locate her!!) and then proceedes to prove to us that, oops, sorry, didn't mean that. And in this case, in such a short space of time (several months) and in such a horrible situation. What in the world was Ms Medeiros thinking with the episode which occured the night before Gabriel was to sail off to war again? Awful! Simply awful!As you can tell from reading all of these reviews, this book has at least one plot twist. I cannot be as specific as I would like because it isn't fair to spoil the plot for other readers. If I could be specific, I would have REALLY blasted this book. A favorite author of mine, but definitely a book of hers which I will throw in my to-go box from a distance of 10 feet, or more. I'm mad!"},{"Title":"Yours Until Dawn","review":"I've read every one of Ms. Medeiros' books and they keep getting better and better, if that's possible. I started reading \\"Yours Until Dawn\\" in the morning and had to finish it that day. It drew me into the time and setting and made me care about the characters..just what I want a book to do. And what an ingenious ending! Don't miss this one."},{"Title":"The man without a country,","review":"&quot;The Man Without a Country,&quot; written by Edward Everett Hale in 1863, tells the story of Philip Nolan, a young lieutenant in the United States Navy, who, at his court martial for treason, damned the United States and cavalierly wished that he might never hear her name again. Nolan's sentence was to have his wish fulfilled. For fifty-five years he was kept at sea, being repeatedly transferred from ships that approached land to those that were headed out to sea. Although Nolan was not treated like a prisoner, a unique protocol was developed that kept him from hearing or seeing any news from home.Because of obscure references (especially early in the story) and some archaic wording, reading the story aloud is recommended. This provides an excellent opportunity to demonstrate that much can be gleaned from a story even when references are not completely understood. Pausing periodically to summarize the main points can help to keep students involved until you get to Hale's anecdotes that will truly captivate them.In addition to delineating the consequences of an impetuous act, &quot;The Man Without a Country&quot; provides a thought-provoking portrait of a patriot. In essays or debates students might consider Was Nolan's sentence fair? Should he have been pardoned?"},{"Title":"The man without a country,","review":"I can't believe the reader from Allentown didn't care for this book. I first read this story in high school and remember how choked up I got over Phillip's absolute and total love for a country he hasn't been able to see or hear about for over half his life due to his impassioned, yet stupid youthful declaration that he &quot;never wanted to hear his country's name again!&quot;.I hope other would-be readers listen to the other reviews and try this book.

Hale captures patriotism and heroic efforts in one man as Nolan bravely tries to hide the fact he still loves his country, but shall never see it again. It makes you proud to be an American and live under the glory that our forefathers fought for. So many times have I read this story, and each time I can barely get past parts that bring a tear to my eye. Ultimately a great and powerful book for any reader who enjoys a story of love, agony, and pride."},{"Title":"The man without a country,","review":"When Philip Nolan spewed out the words, &quot;Damn the United States!

The poignancy of this consequence through his long years of exile/imprisonment on U.S. ships crescendoes to the denoument, when the evidence of Nolan's encounter with what he had lost is described.

The book was just as I remembered it. However, with a greater understanding of the world, I have learned to appreciate this classic even more. While an American may not agree with that the United States does, a perfect country or government has yet to be created. Philip Nolan made a statement in which he disowned his country in his younger days. It was a statement that he would quitely regret for the rest of his life. Even in exile, Nolan reflects loyalty to his country in his behavior. On his death bed, Nolan only wants to learn of what has happened to the country since he was exiled. He was able to die a happy man knowing how the country he loved had prospered.The story is intended to made readers appreciate their country. Sometimes it may be difficult to agree with the government. In the end, one realizes that they love their country like a parent or their own child. Nolan had to learn this lesson the hard way."},{"Title":"The man without a country,","review":"How sad that to some of the reviewers reading has become a chore and that a book without &quot;hair pulling&quot; and other action is boring.

I wish I may never hear of the United States again!\\" The court sentenced him to what he wished for.(As the plot unfolds, some young readers -- future attorneys, perhaps -- focus on the irregularity and inhumanity of the sentence. Of course, there was no Philip Nolan, and the entire plot is fiction, a vehicle used by Hale to prompt reflection on the meaning of \\"country\\" in every person's life.)This story was read by every American high school student from the time it was published in 1863 to the 1960s. The availability of many old editions from used booksellers gives testimony to its enduring power over the years. It surely helped form the patriotic sense of the World War II and Vietnam generations.A few years ago, I was with a group of American missionaries in Bangladesh, and in a relaxed discussion about what we had read in high school, hardly anyone remembered \\"Thanatopsis\\" (by William Cullen Bryant), \\"Great Expectations\\" (Charles Dickens), \\" or \\"Evangeline\\" (Henry Wadsworth Longfellow) -- all staples of our generation's high school canon. But when I mentioned \\"The Man Without a Country,\\" every one energetically nodded and said \\"Yes, that really made an impression!\\"\\"The Man Without a Country\\" deserves a revival. It is \\"accessible,\\" by which I mean that young minds can easily follow the plot and understand Hale's point. It can be related to lessons in American history -- Aaron Burr's treason and the \\"copperheads\\" of the Civil War, for instance. It conveys ideals from the young republic across the years to the present. It keeps alive a famous passage from Sir Walter Scott's \\"The Lay of the Last Minstrel,\\" sung with feeling by the chorales at the service academies:Breathes there the man with soul so deadWho never to himself hath said,This is my own, my native land!Whose heart hath ne'er within him burned,As home his footsteps he hath turnedFrom wandering on a foreign strand!If such there breathe, go, mark him well;For him no minstrel raptures swell;High though his titles, proud his name,Boundless his wealth as wish can claimDespite those titles, power, and pelf,The wretch, concentred all in self,Living, shall forfeit fair renown,And, doubly dying, shall go downTo the vile dust from whence he sprung,Unwept, unhonored , and unsung.Read the story and ask yourself this question: Did Philip Nolan love his country because he longed for the land where he grew up?

Its brief, but imparts a strong message to us.We must always stand together in times of war and peace.America is the best country in the world despite world opinion.The deep, psychological punishment inflicted on Nolan can only serve to remind us what life would be like without our country even with all her imperfections.She is still the best the world has to offer as far as freedom and opportunity are concerned.Why would everyone be trying to get in as opposed to out.This little gem of a story makes plain why we need to stand together as Americans, more now than ever and should be read by every American both old and new."},{"Title":"The man without a country,","review":"I LIKE TO SAY THAT THE BOOK WAS VERY GOOD.

If you're looking to get this book, you could probably find mine on Half.com.....otherwise......I would pass on it."},{"Title":"Reel Pressure","review":"... ... ...Pearson doesn't write car chase thrillers or violent books, instead, he tells a story, let's you know who the villain is and then spends time creativly having the characters dispense justice;usually outside the legal system's solution. It's not a who-done-it or a cozy but a story where businessmen and lawyers are usually the heavies; where deeds coupled with clever solutions to problems affected by ordinary people doing extraordinary things in the face of pressure win the day.Granted, you have to think and use your own imagination as you read. After all, this isn't television doing the thinking for you, it's a book where you can enjoy plot and character nuances your own way. I began to like Sydney and Brent in his first book and they flower again here.Give Pearson a try and you'll find out that the story is good. At the same time, I'd tell you that if you want a murder a minute or car chase scenes and ... every ten seconds, then this isn't your cup of tea; they are only here as they fit into the problem, the plot, the solution and the people.

Set in the colonial days of Southern India (from the period of 1899 to 1947), David Davidar takes you through the struggles of Solomon Dorai, his son Daniel and grandson, Kannan as they come to terms with their inner conflicts with the caste system, sectarian violence, the squabbles of an extended family, and impending nationalism. Inevitably it is the strong sense of family duty that draws everyone back to the centrepiece, the Dorai house in Chevathar.The author's attempts to weave history in between the story lines can be dry at times but once you overcome that, the book grows on you. If you do not enjoy long descriptive narratives of people and places, then this book will have little appeal. However,anyone who has an interest in India or Indian history during the British &quot;occupation&quot;, will find the House of Blue Mangoes a pleasurable read."},{"Title":"The House of Blue Mangoes: Library Edition","review":"Can't get over the average customer reviews I find on Amazon, makes me think there are a lot of frustrated novelists or at the very least wannabe book reviewers out there. Take this book for example. I loved it. I've never been to India and after all that's happened in recent months I doubt I want to set foot on its shores. But I picked up this book after it got a great review in my local paper and I loved it. Maybe it's because I like big lush informative sagas like Barbara Kingsolver's THE POISONWOOD BIBLE but I thought this novel was fantastic. It gave me a brilliant sense of place, I laughed and wept with its characters and I now have a sense of why India is the way it is. And the author sure can write. Talk of lyrical beauty!

The author has performed a splendid job of developing the various characters, creating a story that is very captivating, and portraying the historical backdrop of India during this time period. The interplay and relationships among the Indians and the British are clearly presented, and the different manner in which the various generations of the Indian family (the Dorais) adjust and respond to the British rule illuminates much about the history of the country. The author has an extremely engaging writing style, and the descriptions of Indian culture, landscape, buildings, etc. are fascinating. This is apparently Mr. Davidar's first book, and I can only hope he will write another."},{"Title":"The House of Blue Mangoes: Library Edition","review":"The critical reviewers are on target but unfortunately they don't dwell on the vast superficiality of the novel and the cut and paste, politically correct ramble that it is. I bought the book at a discount in a small town in the U.S. where I live. I was ecstatic that I could get the book so cheap, for I remember reading Prasannarajan's review in India Today, and I usually like what he says. And if I remember right, Prasannarajan speaks well of this meandering trickle of a terrible tale. I wish I had the patience to sit down and do a serious deconstruction of this \\"plotless plot\\" and \\"clueless narration\\" from a pretend writer who relies on a condensed version of the Gita, the first chapter of Radhakrishnan's tome on the Upanishads and whatever else he could lay his hands on to \\"learn\\" and \\"speak\\" about India. Dilettantism therefore is in powerful and peerless display."},{"Title":"The House of Blue Mangoes: Library Edition","review":"The House of Blue Mangos is a well told story of three generations of the \\"Dorai\\" family in South India, mostly in the modern day state of Tamil Nadu, but under the British Raj, the Madras Presidency. Davidar has a strong command of the sights, sounds, tastes and even smells of South India, and does a fantastic job of bringing these all to life. As a non-Indian currently living in South India I found that the book provided beautiful insights into the region while telling a good story.The story itself is good, not great. As other reviewers have noted, the first section of the book about the first generation was by far the best told portion of the story. However, unlike some other reviewers, I did enjoy reading about the second and third generation of the Dorai family as Dravidar moves from village caste violence to \\"International caste violence\\" under the guise of Nationalism and WWII.For the most part, Dravidar does a good job of developing the characters. The only flaw is his lack of fully explaining the decisions of the third-generation, Kannan. I often felt that his decisions were predictable and cliche, and Dravidar never fully explained how all of his decisions fit within the character mold Dravidar had developed for Kannan. His supposed \\"stubborn Dorai character\\" sometimes leads him to being fiercely loyal, and at other times led him to completely give up on certain relationships, but you never understood how that stubborness fully informed that decision.Further, Dravidar could have made the book a bit more compelling by describing more of the changes to the South India region from the 1880s to 1946 (when the novel ends). To the reader, it almost seems as all customs and traditions remained completely static in village communities, which is certainly not accurate. Some of the characters could have fit within any generation of the story, which made it sometimes hard to believe that the novel was progressing through time. If there were no mentions of nationalism or WWII, the reader might completely forget that the story encompasses nearly a century.In the end I thoroughly enjoyed this novel and recommend it."},{"Title":"The House of Blue Mangoes: Library Edition","review":"David Davidar's The House of the Blue Mangoes is an interesting family saga--capturing the history of the Dorai family--beginning in 1899 and ending some fifty years later. The novel weaves the family's history with that of India seamlessly. Davidar's writing flows--it certainly demonstrates a strong talent. There is an underlying warmth and wit in the novel that makes it a pleasure to read. The characters all have wonderful depth and the story is often (although not all the time) very engrossing. I enjoyed this novel and would recommend it to anyone with an interest in Indian literature."},{"Title":"The House of Blue Mangoes: Library Edition","review":"Davidar is the President of Penguin books in India and this is his first novel, which he supposedly submitted to another publisher anonymously. Similar to Vikram Seth (Suitable Boy) and Amitav Ghosh (Glass Palace), the story follows the lives and generations of a Indian family. The story is centered around southern India, which gives it a very different feel compared to most other books which are set in the north. In fact, reading some of the Tamil was fun.I had a bit of difficulty getting into the book at first, but by about a quarter of the way into the story, I was hooked. The characters are very vivid and likeable and Davidar's ability to intertwine current events and Indian history into the lives of his characters is uncanny - withouth sounding like a history lesson. I was also interested to find out after I had read the book that Vikran Seth had edited it.I found the ending a little bit abrupt, but overall enjoyed the book very much."},{"Title":"The House of Blue Mangoes: Library Edition","review":"...It is very obvious that the author has talent, as the first 100 pages or so really grip you. I am not going into the plot because it has been covered many times already, but I just want to say that it is unbelievable all these Indian authors(of international repute at least) still can't get over the fact that in 1947, India got its independence from the British. Every single story is set during those times. Get over it, we are in the TWENTY-FIRST century now, try writing something about present day. But you see they can't write about present day because then you cannot paint the country as an exotic place full of backward,tribal customs which is the only way to get (THEY THINK) the attention of principally-white prize-givers and principally-white big publishers. And in doing so, they all do a major disservice to their country of origin on whom they draw so heavily to make their living. I just want to say that the man knows how to write (except towards the end where the story gets really boring - who cares about a tennis tournament among British leftovers on a tea plantation in South India in 1943?) and that the first part of this book is well written, and from then on it's downhill. This book is NOT an historical novel, it is just the story of 3 generations of a South Indian family, and only partly interesting at that. And the claim on the front cover of how it uses the backdrop of the \\"New, Modern-day India\\" is a blatant lie. This book ends at 1947. Newsflash: A LOT of water has flown under the bridge between 1947 and 2002.Finally, this book makes it seem like the Caste System is widespread in India which just plain nonsense. It WAS prevalent in the South, and never a real issue in the North. All this book does is give you another nasty, distorted and stereotypical view of India."},{"Title":"The House of Blue Mangoes: Library Edition","review":"This book by David Davidar traces three generations of a Christian Indian family in southwest India. We are given a clear insight into the values, customs, highs and lows of life in a village in which the family head was the leader of the entire community. As such, he was constantly threatened by a non-Christian Indian community across the river from his.We learn of the role of women over these three generations - how it changed in many instances and remainded the same in others; how the role of sons in the family could effect total change if the balance was altered; how native Indians were treated by the English raj - in this book one example is the status of the third generation son - married to an Anglo-Indian wife - who goes to a management job in an Indian tea plantation owned and run by Englishmen. Indian legend and history are both treated in this book which gives us a close look into the life of past generations of Indians as they try to forge their identity and independence. An excellent read for those who wish to \\"feel\\" what India was, and perhaps, still is."},{"Title":"The House of Blue Mangoes: Library Edition","review":"The House of Blue Mangoes is a beautifully narrated novel about three generations of Dorais, a wealthy Christian family in a village named Chevathar situated in the extreme south of India, on the Gulf of Mannar, within the political jurisdiction of Madras Presidency in British India. The events are centered on the village and the male members of this family though the action temporarily shifts to Nagercoil, Madras, and the tea plantations of Pulimedu but eventually returns to Chevathar. It is indeed a gripping story and the narrative is well polished and perfected with clarity and details.The story is divided into three books and 106 subsections, dealing with the lives and exploits of the patriarchs of Dorai family, namely Solomon, Daniel his son and Kannan his grandson. Solomon the thalaivar (headman) of Chevathar grapples with the age-old rivalries of caste and clan in pursuit of peace and prosperity for his village. Daniel through his own ingenuity pursues a medical career and makes a name for himself along with much wealth to become the founder of the colony of Doraipuram. However, at last he dies in frustration and disappointment. Kannan, after a prolonged flirtation with the British culture and customs through managing an English tea plantation and marrying an Anglo-Indian girl, eventually returns to Chevathar disillusioned yet determined to start his life all over. Through these Davidar offers us a strong and vivid picture of the complex and sometimes conflicting nature of India's village life in the early part of the twentieth century. All this is in the backdrop of the Indian independence movement and the two World Wars besides many caste wars, class struggles and family issues.The style of the narrative is gripping, engaging and dense with details. It is also authentic with smells, colors and tastes coming alive, all leading to the central key image of the blue mangoes of Chevathar. At the same time the movement of the narrative can sometimes feel sluggish with compacted particulars and specifics. However, it often explodes with the brilliance of the novelist as a researcher and narrator. The House of Blue Mangoes stands out as one of the best Indian novels set in the historical background of events from 1899 to 1946."},{"Title":"The House of Blue Mangoes: Library Edition","review":"I found this novel fairly non-compelling. It was hard to even get through the first quarter, and I was two thirds through before it became very interesting.

But the novel is not a negative take on India,rather it's shot through with brilliantly described colours, smells and textures of a country that has never left me although I have spent twenty years in Vancouver. I try and read a fair amount of Indian fiction and this novel must rank with the best."},{"Title":"The House of Blue Mangoes: Library Edition","review":"Before I read The House of Blue Mangoes, I'd enjoyed Vikram Seth's A Suitable Boy and Rohinton Mistry's A Fine Balance so an excellent review of the book in the Post prompted me to pick it up. I must admit, however, that I was a bit wary when I began the book because the reviewer had described the novel as \\"Tolstoyan\\" which seemed a bit excessive. But when I had finished the book I could see why she had been so effusive with her praise.The House of Blue Mangoes is a vast, engrossing saga that is a powerful blend of family drama and historical events set in the south of India. Tracking events from 1899 to the year India gained independence (1947), the book tells its story through three generations of the Dorai family. The Dorais are Indian Christians who struggle to cope with internal family squabbles and the great events of the time that bear down on them. The narrative begins with Solomon Dorai, the patriarch of the clan, who is severely tested by caste conflict.The caste war that Solomon has desperately tried to avoid eventually consumes him and the story passes to his sons Daniel and Aaron. Aaron the younger son who is a hothead comes to a sticky end but Daniel holds firm and the family thrives and prospers. But this precis does not give an indication of the myriad adventures, tragedies and triumphs that befall the family. Not to put too fine a point on it, there is enough here to keep the most demanding or restless reader satisfied.Of particular interest to me were the minutiae of family life in southern India--marriages, courtship rituals,death, celebrations. I was drawn into a world that was completely foreign to me but at the end felt familiar. The House of Blue Mangoes is a book that both entertains and teaches. I recommend it wholeheartedly."},{"Title":"The House of Blue Mangoes: Library Edition","review":"I suppose you could call me a partial Indophile. I love Indian food, Indian novels, hate Indian movies (the three I've been dragged to by an ex-girl-friend), and hate the politics, heat and poverty of the country. Not that I'm an expert I've only been there once on a business trip five years ago but that was plenty. Maybe it was because I went there at the height of summer and was roasted alive. But I found two things there that continue to exert their grip on me, which is why I'm writing this reveiw. The first was the first Indian novel I read, Arundhati Roy's THE GOD OF SMALL THINGS, the second was mangoes. I blitzed out on both and since then have read pretty much all the major Indian novels although the only mangoes we get here are from the Philippines I think. But I loved Davidar's book. Not since Roy's novel have I read any book about India that gave me such a visceral feel for the place (coincidentally both are set in India's South) and to my great delight I discovered the author loves mangoes almost as much as I do (did you know India has over 1000 varieties?). The book is chock-full of stuff designed to titillate the taste buds of even the most jaded reader -- tiger hunts, battles, family drama, tennis matches -- balanced by thought-provoking stuff on caste wars, India's fractured history, the treatment of women... Some of the stuff is unbelievable or perhaps not so unbelievable considering the stuff they show on TV. This is an absolutely engrossing book."},{"Title":"The House of Blue Mangoes: Library Edition","review":"This book helped me organize much loose data I had acquired about India, and wasn't quite sure of the order of the events. It was a very nice way to solidify my very scant knowledge of the country. As a history lesson, this book excels, for it makes interesting and lively what could be perceived as dry historical information. The family saga -- three generations -- is perfectly suitable for such an endeavor.However, the book portrays three different lives [more with the subplots], and as such, it lacks smooth continuity, for as soon as we begin to understand, and identify with a character, a death occurs, and it is time to move on to the next point of interest, or character. The only continuous link is Chevathar, the home place.The sense of place, the depiction of life, the taste and colors of India are indeed portrayed well and they seduce. But for the emotional stacatto we readers have to play, because of differing main characters, I have taken one star away from Mr. Davidar's very good book."},{"Title":"The House of Blue Mangoes: Library Edition","review":"&quot;The House of Blue Mangoes&quot; is a novel set in southern India and spanning three generations of the Dorai family during the years 1899-1947. Although I would call this a historical novel, Davidar really doesn't explain the historical background much and even his characters go about their daily lives without investing too much time in current events.For the people of Chevathar, the village of the Dorai family, history is symbolized by a road made famous for the incredible sweetness of the blue mangoes that are native to the region. This road turns out to be something of a mixed blessing. The people of Chevathar seemed to be dealing with their caste system in an orderly fashion until this road came alone and upset the proverbial applecart. Now, instead of the paths designated for each caste, everyone seems to take the road lined by the blue mangoes. This, of course, causes problems and even the Dorai family become victims. Their patriarch, Solomon, is beset with problems, while his elder son, Aaron wanders into a life of crime...with terrible consequences.Daniel, Aaron's younger brother, decides not to let politics and social problems ruin his life the way they had ruined his father's and brother's. He invents a skin-whitening cream called, &quot;Dr. Dorai's Moonwhite Thylam.&quot; Rescuing the family home from destruction, Daniel renames it Neelan Illum, or &quot;The House of Blue Mangoes.&quot; Daniel loses no time in letting his entire family know they are welcome at &quot;The House of Blue Mangoes&quot; but only if they agree to leave politics and its poisonous fruit behind.Of course, Daniel's plan does not work out, but his son, Kannan, does inherit Daniel's deep aversion to politics. Davidar, himself, seems to share his characters' aversion to involvement in political and social strife. In this novel, history serves only to ornament the background, not to shape the characters or drive the plot. Being very apolitical myself, I thought I would like this aspect of the book, and I do, to a certain extent. What I don't like is the fact that Davidar's characters, by their very refusal to even acknowledge the political turmoil around them, are rendered extraordinarily shallow.I might have been able to tolerate ignorant characters had they been fascinating in some other way, but the characters in this novel simply weren't. They are flat and one dimensional and their problems seem to revolve around the cliche. Davidar, himself, doesn't seem to care about his characters...or what happens to them.What does seem to interest Davidar, and the thrust of this book, are details. While Davidar doesn't bother to tell us a character's intimate thoughts, thus letting us get to know him and care about him, he does devote pages and pages to things like the sport of well-jumping, the traditional siddha medicinal practice, the social ins and outs of a proper afternoon tea, the best ways to hunt tiger, and the differences among the many varieties of mango. And, while much of this is very interesting, it certainly doesn't make for a compelling novel.Political and social problems aside, if Davidar had only lavished half as much care and development on his characters as he does on the details of the book, then &quot;The House of Blue Mangoes&quot; would have been an extremely interesting and involving book. As it is, it is not even a great reference guide."},{"Title":"The House of Blue Mangoes: Library Edition","review":"Some are comparing this to God of Small things...Are you kidding me?The novel is cutout with artificial characters masquerading as historical ones. Some of the characters teach us georgraphy and history lesson on India and sound like a mouthpiece for the author to air his opinion about the Colonial British (White man?), India, caste system, Christianity, Hindu mythology etc..I understand this is work of fiction but the novel is so full of contrived characters and settings detailed in superficial tone. If you liked novels of Vikram seth and Arunadhathi roy...stay away from this!!"},{"Title":"The House of Blue Mangoes: Library Edition","review":"The Tamil people have over the period of years spread over many countries and have dispersed outside Tamil Nadu. If a Tamil person is having an identity crisis, this novel may answer some questions. It is also a good look at caste structures as it existed then and now.The novel is a pseudo fictional version of three people depicted as three different generations. The first generation evokes memories of the caste wars at and nearby the Meenakshi temple in Madurai long ago, the second generation looks at the brief flirtation Tamils had with respect to the freedom fight and the third generation gets an upclose and personal look at the English masters and everything that went along with that.The details provided in the novel are an excellent reproduction of the day to day life in the southern parts of Tamil Nadu. The various views are presented without bias; although the author does seem to have a soft corner for Father Ashworth.A must read for people residing in southern parts of India and Kerala."},{"Title":"The House of Blue Mangoes: Library Edition","review":"The House of Blue Mangoes is a rarity as rare as the blue mangoes in the book. Let me explain. In the last many years most of the Indian novels I've read have been written by Indians living abroad which robs them of a certain authentic feel. This novel felt authentic alright. I could smell, taste, experience the colours, food and vibrancy of India. In brief it tells the story of a South Indian family, the Dorais who are mired in a period of immense change and turbulance. What I found especially admirable about the book was the way in which the author seamlessly (by and large, there were a couple of sections where it could've been done better) melds the family story with the great historical events of the early twentieth century in India; the struggle for independence, caste wars, world wars etc. The characters are well developed...my favourites were Solomon and Aaron Dorai, although I did like Charity and Father Ashworth as well. The book taught me a lot about India while simultaneously keeping me absolutely hooked through a gripping story."},{"Title":"The House of Blue Mangoes: Library Edition","review":"I wanted this book to be as fascinating as the first hundred pages. Certainly all of the elements are present: the family patriarchy, feuding neighbors, an entrenched caste system in precarious balance.Three generations of Dorais act out this familial drama, male characters predominant, from Solomon Dorai to his sons Aaron and Daniel, and Daniel's son Kammel. In each generation, at least one son is banished to make his way among strangers. In Daniel's case, because he could not fight to preserve the family's honor, and was sent away with the women and children before the battle that cost the lives of many important Dorai men. Much later, Daniel returns to accept his birthright. But later, Daniel's own son willingly leaves, unable to make peace within the family hierarchy. Yet all roads lead to the Dorai compound, where relatives live together in common purpose, keeping the land intact. In a tribute to Solomon, who first had the dream, Daniel names the enclave The House of Blue Mangoes. Years later, as David lies dying, Kamman returns to assume the role of his father's successor, with the same purpose, the continuation of the family name and property. There is plentiful material to fuel the plot, particularly the political unrest prior to the Partition in 1947.There is no question that the British trampled the land and the people, Her Majesty's representatives bloated with their own importance and dreams of Empire. But Davidar's characters are difficult to understand, seeming cutouts before the vast panoply of social change, who only parrot historical facts, often with little interest. I wanted a sense of the people themselves, their passions, dreams and fears, not an explanation like a school primer. For example, Daniel becomes a physician, trained by a charitable benefactor to help the poor and indigent; he passes the clinic on to Daniel. But Daniel makes his fortune on patent medicines and moves back to his home village to establish the family colony, never looking back. Then Kammal, Daniel's son, works on a tea plantation after marrying an inappropriate woman chosen in a romantic stupor, she part Indian, part English. On the English run plantation, Kammal's wife is never accepted, but he toady's to his bosses, believing himself part of their society. In fact, he is their pawn. Kannan deals with his self-concept and particular circumstances in an almost simple-minded fashion. He has no substance, obsequious and self-effacing.I have enjoyed many finely written Indian novels, among them The God of Small Things and A Fine Balance, and Cracking India, and love to immerse myself in this country and its history. Unfortunately, House of Blue Mangoes does not meet this standard. Davidar writes such muddled sentences as: \\"Michael drove very carefully, but the road was a familiar one, and there was no other vehicle about, so they made good progress.\\" Yet the first chapter begins: \\"...as the lonely violence of dawn sweeps across the sky\\", with vivid imagery. Perhaps the story just got away from him, but in the final third of the novel the wooden dialog of the British literally put me into a stupor, bludgeoned by idiotic conversations. Because of Davidar's descriptive and poetic abilities, I believe this author has the talent to write about what he knows so well. All the stories and history are locked within him, perhaps more approachable on a smaller scale or more intimate characterization."},{"Title":"The House of Blue Mangoes: Library Edition","review":"This book was a gift from a friend whose judgment I respect. I tell myself that he must have recommended it because he only read Part 1. Indeed, this book's first 100 or so pages are terrific stuff, well written, descriptive, exciting, dramatic passages about caste hatred at the end of the 19th century in the south of India. I thought I had a great book on my hands: good characters, good descriptions, good action, and lots of interest. But then I went on to Part 2 and it's as if the world had spun around 180 degrees. The writing became turgid, dull, forced, absurd, uninteresting, and even pointless in many places. I ran out of energy to go on, but forced myself forward, hoping for the fireworks that started the whole thing off, only to be sorely disappointed. At Part 3, I admit I simply skimmed through to the end because I knew the author was taking the \\"plot\\" to the next generation of characters and, frankly, I didn't care much about the author's characterless, flat parodies of people anymore. I blame the publisher for not more firmly editing the material and for not giving the author constructive criticism and firm direction. But there are few good editors, just as there are precious few good writers out there. I think Davidar has a gift, but it needs direction. I hope he finds it."},{"Title":"The House of Blue Mangoes: Library Edition","review":"As the other reviewers have described, this is a family saga like The Glass Palace or A Suitable Boy. It does an excellent job of setting the family story within the historical context of colonialism and nationalism.For me, however, the beauty of The House of Blue Mangoes is in capturing the texture of the deep South, an area that is much neglected in Indian literature. Mr. Davidar's evocation of the food, the vegetation and landscape, and the people of Thirunelveli and Kanya Kumari is a valuable addition to Indian literature. I must admit to a certain prejudice in that I served in the Peace Corps near Nagercoil many years ago."},{"Title":"The House of Blue Mangoes: Library Edition","review":"Family sagas are the form of fiction I like the most so I was expecting a lot from this novel and I'm glad it didn't let me down.

This is not to say this is a depressing book, on the contrary you come away from it feeling pretty good, not least because the author writes wonderfully well."},{"Title":"The House of Blue Mangoes: Library Edition","review":"In the past two decades there have been some wonderful novels written by Indian authors, but none of them were based/set against the background of Tamil Nadu's history. Vikram Seth's tome, \\"A Suitable Boy,\\" was set against the backdrop of Delhi and Uttar Pradesh, while Arundati Roy's \\"God of Small Things,\\" was set in Kerala.Publisher turned writer David Davidar's book \\"The House of Blue Mangoes,\\" nicely fills that lacuna. Davidar deftly weaves South history and culture into the narrative that is set in the fictional town of Chevathar located in the southern most tip of India.The novel chronicles the tragedies and triumphs of the powerful Dorai family: Solomon, Daniel, Aaron and Kannan. The panoramic story begins in the close of the 19th century and ends in 1947 when Indian became independent.Davidar's skill as a storyteller is evident and the novel makes for an absorbing read. Also his interest and keen eye for research is reflected in this historical novel."},{"Title":"The House of Blue Mangoes: Library Edition","review":"Mr Davidar thought he was writing the great Indian novel. Unfortunately, what came out at the end was a schoolboy effort, characterized by Raj cliches, prose that sounds like it is translated, and occasional paragraphs containing personal views on India and Indians which dont mesh with the main text at all. I am glad I borrowed this free of cost from the library and did not waste my money - though I did waste my time reading it. All I can say is that it would make good reading on a long flight - at least the story has tempo and keeps you mildly entertained."},{"Title":"The House of Blue Mangoes: Library Edition","review":"\\"The House of Blue Mangoes\\" has been hyped as a sensational debut by David Davidar, the CEO of Penguin Publishing in India. The book traces the lives of three generations of Dorais as they try to find their place in the world. Solomon Dorai, the patriarch of the family, must strive hard to keep his town, Chevathar, from erupting into violence as a result of caste disputes. Ultimately, Solomon falls victim to this very evil. Of Solomon&#65533;s two sons, Aaron is a hothead whose primary claim to fame is the successful clearing ( in high-jump) of a massive well in Chevathar. The other son, Daniel, is much more worldly-wise and takes care of his family after a successful stint as \\"vaidyan\\" (doctor). Daniel&#65533;s son, Kannan, chooses to move away from Chevathar and seek his fortunes in the white man&#65533;s (read occupiers, the British) tea estates. We see changes that afflict the Dorai clan -- assimilation into foreign cultures and even a \\"love\\" marriage in this generation. Finally we learn that even if your average Dorai strays far from Chevathar, he magically hears the call and always comes back \\"home\\". Yawn!The biggest problem with Blue Mangoes is that the story is so mediocre. In a recent interview, Mr. Davidar mentioned how he wanted to write about all his childhood memories played out in South India. I wish he had stuck to that agenda and written a wonderful memoir of sorts. Instead, what he has done is tried to create a filler story around all his memories. And that is always a dangerous game to play. What&#65533;s worse, Davidar has tried to create a \\"saga\\" which means he throws everything but the kitchen sink in. You&#65533;ve got caste, caste, and more caste. You&#65533;ve got dowry, you&#65533;ve got oppressive husbands, subservient wives, man-eating tigers, the works. Davidar tries hard to create a panoramic effect but in the end, the book rambles too much. He needs a better editor. Another hindrance that many readers might find annoying is Davidar&#65533;s generous use of Tamil words with no translation or lexicon included.The one saving grace of \\"House of Blue Mangoes\\" is that it is a masaledar, spicy read. It would make a good beach book. But I would borrow my copy from the library. Spend your money on better books."},{"Title":"The House of Blue Mangoes: Library Edition","review":"As an Indian from the south of my country currently living in the Bay Area I've often bemoaned the lack of good literature on my part of the world. David Davidar remedies that and how! For his novel does for India in general and South India in particular what few novels do -- create a rich, beautifully layered world that the reader can sink into for days on end and emerge as if from a dream. I won't bother to repeat the plot as other reviewers have done that. Suffice it for me to say that THE HOUSE OF BLUE MANGOES is a compelling blend of family drama and history which will reward anyone who chooses to pick it up. I'm sorry to sound like the author's blurb writer but when books move me, I tend to try and spread my enthusiasm for them as much as I can!"},{"Title":"The House of Blue Mangoes: Library Edition","review":"The House of Blue Mangoes - Neelam Illum - is a tale written on a large canvas spanning three generations of the Dorai family. The scale of this tale is magnificent and immense in its spread and reach across centuries and cultures. History and its constant mutatory effect on the socio-political aspect of Indian society, forms the backdrop against which the lives of the characters in this novel are played out.The book is about three generations of the Dorais and spans the latter nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Their story is thus deeply intertwined with that of the tumultuous political fabric of the times, set as it is in the last few decades of imperial rule in India. Solomon, Daniel and Kannan, are the three successive Dorais and though Davidar has fleshed out all three characters well, this book is Daniel's book, and it is in the telling of Daniel's tale that Davidar comes into his own.After meandering down \`clever' alleyways for the first fifty or so pages when the narration seems interminably boring and a tad preachy (Father Ashworth!), Davidar settles down to doing what he intended to do - tell a story. And once the realization seems to have hit him, there's no stopping the pace of this book. Most debut forays into fiction have the weary pall of yet another \`wannabe clever' book. This one though seems to have missed that and like its chief protagonist, Daniel, who lives life divorced from any aspect of it that does not involve him and that he cannot control, this book tells a story divorced largely of unnecessary frills(excluding bits like the tea ceremony and the search for the mangoes)and, is for the large part, neither preachy nor does it make judgment or provoke much such.This book affords no appreciations of style or language or poetry of prose; it tells a story, that's it. Moments in the lives of the characters of the book that one would think would require some deliberation; moments to stop, ponder, and reflect upon, are sadly dealt with in a very superfluous fashion. And that catches the reader by surprise. Instances like chapter 56 on the mangoes (the casual way in which the Chevathar Neelam is adjudged the finest by Daniel after a rather tedious telling of the scouring of the countryside of the land for its competitor, is left curiously and anti climatically undone) and the return of Daniel to Chevathar are some such. The pace of the book is largely sustained and makes for an engrossing read."},{"Title":"The House of Blue Mangoes: Library Edition","review":"This is another novel in the genre of the Macaulayite Indian trying his/her best to describe India to the West.

It was a little slow in the beginning and in retrospect, despite the fact that Solomon Dorai's life was the &quot;bravest&quot; and full of ancient heroic adventure, it was the slowest in pace. In comparison, Daniel Dorai's was more scientific and his son Kannan Dorai's very contemporary and British. It is remarkable how these men, from successive generations, had such different lives yet were drawn emotionally by their native village to return and settle there. I feel like I read three books about three very different characters, and their very different quality of experiences. I thought Davidar very subtly addressed a beautiful point - of Kannan's experience and what he feels and says before he finally leaves the tea estates at Pulimed.The one thing I realized about the book was that it lacked sufficient conversation - it struck me that though there was rich, vivid description about feelings and places, there was very little conversation.

Took me a little bit to get into it but by the first 20 pages or so I was hooked.

The author was a draftee at about the time of Pearl Harbor, and this is his story from the end of boot camp, through being rushed onto a boat for the Pacific, to his arrival and first several months in Australia in early 1942. It's funny, it's touching, and there is so incredibly much detail. Some of the commentary is dated and hard to understand now, but for a historian, that's part of the fun, looking up the references.The author was part of the 32nd \\"Red Arrow\\" Division, and I've been able to trace his unit's actual movements from the description in this book. None of the names in the book are real, of course, due to wartime censorship; actually, some of the references to censorship are the funniest parts of the book.

That's what the period of 1942 described here was like for St. George. An American draftee, he trained in California, traveled via ship to Australia, and then lingered for months in one \\"staging area\\" after another. Very few memoirs I can recall describe this as well, or as entertainingly, as St. George does here.

Nothing very dramatic happens --they adjust to camp life and Australian life, drink, try (and largely fail) to meet women, and end by being shipped off to stop the Japanese invasion of New Guinea. The story ends as they are on the airplane going to New Guinea,so the fate of the unit in actual combat is not described. This may be just as well, since I doubt the author could have maintained the gently humorous tone of this work through the (by all accounts brutal) New Guinea fighting. As far as it goes, the story combines an unheroic realism with a basically cheerful, or at least resigned, attitude, and is often mildly funny. It gives a very real feel for wartime Australia (or it seems real to me--I wasn't there).

The first review for the paperback edition says that there are a lot of commentaries and clarifications; the second review for the kindle edition is more a lesson on Aristotle than a review of this book, but gives 5 stars. But notice that the kindle edition has ONLY the translation: no notes, no comments. In the description of the book there is no mention that the kindle version differs from the paper version, while this should be explicitely stated. Moreover, there are no active links in the table of contents. I give 2 stars (instead of one) only because I respect the work of the two translators, but Amazon should separate the evalutions of printed books and of kindle books, otherwise the average star rating has no meaning."},{"Title":"Aristotle's Physics","review":"GREAT REFERENCE WORK. MANY MORE SUCH REFERENCE BOOKS SHOULD BE MADE AVAILABLE FOR HIGH SCHOOL, COLLEGE, AND UNIVERSITY POST GRADUATE STUDENTS."},{"Title":"The Hidden Gifts of the Introverted Child","review":"As an innie, I appreciate any resources that help others to understand the different learning styles and needs that introverts have from extroverts. I don't need a scientific explanation of why I am different, but do need to be understood for who I am. I am pleased to see that one of the reviewers found this valuable both as a parent and as a teacher. I wish more teachers would be open-minded toward our differences, and accepting of the different needs of different children. Too often children are expected to fit into one mold, and if they don't then they are labeled as difficult or uncooperative (or learning disabled)."},{"Title":"The Hidden Gifts of the Introverted Child","review":"My first reaction was, I'm _not_ going to like this book. The title seems too pop-psychology and the whole \\"hidden gifts\\" thing... anyway, my snap judgment was that this would be a cheesy book.Boy, am I glad I was wrong.America is an extroverted country. Nearly 75% of the people you have met are extraverts - they get energized by getting it done, getting going, getting together. Zoom zoom zoom. Certainly our media is set up that way, and our success stories are full of it. So, ... 75% of the kids you have met are naturally inclined to do well in the zoom zoom culture.That leaves out 25% of the kids you have met, kids who cherish simplicity and deep relationships, and who do not go with the fast-paced flow. Introversion is normal - it is not a problem to be corrected, just like we don't try to change a child's left- or right-handedness.These kids may seem spacey or dreamy, and sometimes they are overlooked by the world. They need lots of downtime to recharge their batteries. For these kids, being in school is like being a rubberband. It's a stretch for them to get on a crowded schoolbus, then getting started on their day in a classroom full of kids is even more of a stretch. All day, they are surrounded by people, stretching, stretching. They are *far* out of their comfort zone, and sometimes, that rubberband snaps.Their teachers say that they have trouble with social skills, or they may get fixated on one topic or one friend to the exclusion of the others. The teacher may suspect a psychological problem, like ADD. These children may complain of being sleepy, or they may just give up in the middle of the day, completely out of energy. But they are not difficult or diseased or disturbed. They are performing an unpleasant task - spending all their energy with no time to relax.Most classrooms are extroverted classrooms, with lots going on and a strictly-enforced fast pace.This book gave me a handle on introverted children and how to approach them, how to recognize and encourage them, and how to offer them the quiet time and orderliness they crave. It's written to equip parents with a toolbox for teaching coping skills to their introverted kids.My favorite idea in the book was... introverted kids are like contented trees. Trees dig those roots in deep sigh with the wind. Children like to have roots, too. Orderliness and predictable patterns give them that rootedness. That, and your love and acceptance!"},{"Title":"The Hidden Gifts of the Introverted Child","review":"I bought this book to help understand my 10 year old daughter, who is an \\"innie\\". It has helped me understand her and my \\"innie\\" husband. It also made me realize you can't \\"convert\\" an \\"innie\\" to an \\"outie\\", and now I wouldn't even want to.

WORTHY EVERY PENNY!!! I have learned so much about introverts that I never knew and definitely never truly stopped to appreciate. My son was labeled as \\"shy\\" as a toddler. While it was a convenient label teachers and adults (including me), it is and was completely inaccurate. The insight that Dr. L shares convicted me, but will help me parent my \\"innie\\" the way he needs to be parented. It was like completing a course in a foreign language. After reading it, I feel like I have not only a greater appreciation for my son, but the other \\"innies\\" out there who add depth, sensitivity, and a softness that this \\"in your face\\" world need. It should be required reading for all teachers, pediatricians, and psychologists -- but most importantly \\"outies\\" like me who have been blessed with an \\"innie\\" in their lives."},{"Title":"The Hidden Gifts of the Introverted Child","review":"I got this book to better understand my daughter who was 14 at the time. She took the book away from me to read it. I kept hearing \\"this is ME!\\" and \\"look, mom, this is why I am this way.\\" She felt reassured that she was normal and is embracing her strengths. She has been happier with herself and is interacting with other teens and adults much better; she has \\"come out of her shell\\". I highly recommend this book to introverted preteen/teens and their parents. It really describes the introverted traits well and the questionnaire is helpful.

Our 4 yr old son is very introverted and it was often hard for us to help him handle social situations. His personality can be hard to figure sometimes and this book is wonderful at describing the internal workings of an introverted child - and how to help them thrive. I am often referencing this book to help teachers, friends and family to understand his unique personality. I am reading this book for the second time...this time with a highlighter in hand to mark the many points that I often tell others about."},{"Title":"The Hidden Gifts of the Introverted Child","review":"As an extroverted parent, I was nervous when my son showed signs of being an introvert. I was worried that he wouldn't survive in our extroverted society. Even though my son is 9 mos. old, this book helped me understand and appreciate him. I don't believe the author's main point to this book is to scientifically explain the introverted child. I think it is to explain how to help facilitate our child's world so that it helps them be \\"them.\\"I can already see a difference in how my son reacts to me and the world. He is overall happier because I take the time to understand him. I am a teacher and it also helps me take another look at how I relate to my innie students.If you are confused about your child's quiet behavior, I would definitely recommend this book to you!BTW, I like that the author uses the term \\"innie\\" and \\"outie.\\""},{"Title":"The Hidden Gifts of the Introverted Child","review":"I picked this book up after reading her other book \\"The Introvert Advantage\\".

It makes us tired, it drains us, and it fills us with hopelessness to be constantly harangued by extroverts about how \\"isolated we are\\".We're NOT isolated. We get exposure to the world on OUR terms that works for us.We do NOT need to be over-socialized, we get more from having a few very good friendships and/or intimate relationships.We DO NOT thrive on busy-busy-busy, but on thoughtfulness and planning.If you are a parent with a child you think may be an Introvert, consider getting this book so that you can reap the joys that your Introvert child has ready to be tapped, only waiting for the correct nurturing environment. You both will gain so much."},{"Title":"The Hidden Gifts of the Introverted Child","review":"am an introvert (innie) and reading this book makes me understand myself and others including the outies more. I hope that teachers, parents and anybody who look after kids will have access to this book. It makes us realize that not everybody can fit into a mold.Our innie and outie temperaments are hardwired into our system and nobody can change one into the other. But we can learn to understand the why and how to deal with each other. The first few chapters explain the different chemical pathways and physiology that make up both innie and outie. The rest will help you understand and deal with both types of temperaments.An innie will learn how to develop their extroverting muscle while an outie will learn to take a breather and slow down. Innies are not necessarily shy. But their energy drains in loud, crowded environments. While outies are charge up when put in the same situation. Innies can teach outies to calm down and smell the flowers. While an outie can help an innie to get out there.Innies need downtime to get recharged. While outies (extroverts) thrive in this zoom -zoom fast pace world. Although there are lots of innies who have achieved high positions, they refuse to be on the spotlight. While outies need and want the spotlight. They get energized by being out there, talking and doing. Innies can freeze when put on the spot. Sometimes innies are diagnose to have ADD because they don't show interest. While outies are sometimes diagnose to have ADHD because of their need to be constantly moving and talking. An outie will be bored and edgy in a quiet room. While an innie will be completely satisfied and even be energize in a calm atmosphere. An innie can have meltdowns if you don't give them a chance to recharge. An outie can burn out if they don't calm down.Outie parents/grandparents/teachers/caregivers, etc. will learn how to accept and help an innie child flourish. While innie parents/grandparents/teachers/caregivers, etc. will learn how to cope with a outie child's constant chatter and need to be moving and be out there.Great book for anybody who wants to understand both temperaments."},{"Title":"The Hidden Gifts of the Introverted Child","review":"This book is so boring I can't even bring myself to finish it. I'm halfway through, and so far, all it talks about is the right side of the brain and left side of the brain and how they control your behavior and whether you are an intro or extrovert. Nothing about children, hidden gifts, dealing with an introverted child, bringing out the best in them, etc. - which is what I expected when I purchased the book. Honestly, not worth wasting your time reading it."},{"Title":"The Hidden Gifts of the Introverted Child","review":"An overall average book on the subject. Part I which has three chapters has some facts about the brains of introverts and extroverts but even these evidences are luke-warm and not solidly scientific. The rest of the chapters (11) are mostly written based on personal experience, common sense, and intuition. Also, I really didn't like using 'innies' for introverts, 'outies' for extroverts, 'bonnet' for frontal lobe and 'boot' for the back of the brain. These terms, in my opinion, are unscientific and childish. On page 280, the author makes a distinctive definition between ADHD and ADD. DSM-IV doesn't recognize ADD as a diagnosis anymore. Everything is under the umbrella of ADHD, with different types. Finally, quotations at the beginnings of chapters and sections are often out of the context and not richly related to the content."},{"Title":"The Hidden Gifts of the Introverted Child","review":"I don't doubt that this book has some helpful tips for parents with introverted children but just getting through the book in the first place was difficult. And while I do believe parents should help in some ways, the idea that you should change your whole way of doing things just to fit your introverted child is not going to help them when they get out in the real world and the real world does not cater to them like mommy and daddy did."},{"Title":"Mutts: America's Dogs","review":"This was an enjoyable book, but not completely a positive experience. I currently have three dogs (two mutts, one purebred), and have fostered many - all different kinds, both mixed and pure. I've loved all of them dearly, but books like \\"Mutts\\" imply that one can only love one or the other - purebred or mutt. They're all dogs, all individuals. I don't own a breed, I own my Beau, a collie - a breed that gets a lot of negative attention in this book.Some of the passages about purebred dogs were downright offensive. A Golden/collie mix is described as \\"Valley girl meets Forrest Gump\\" in a section discussing temperaments of mixed breed dogs. There was much space wasted dissing purebreds in like fashion. I guess it's supposed to be humorous, but I found it nasty-tempered and alienating.Yes, there are German Shepherds that are skittish and shelties that are hyperactive yappers, but this book makes it sound like every purebred dog is a degenerate freak and only mutts are \\"real\\" dogs. While I understand the need for a book that promotes mutts as the great pets they are, I wish it didn't have to be at the expense of purebred dogs and those who choose to own them."},{"Title":"Mutts: America's Dogs","review":"This is a terrific book for those considering adopting a shelter dog. It gives you some guidelines about the different temperaments and characteristics of the purebreed components and combinations you might encounter. There are great stories and good training tips, too. Kilcommons has written several good training books that have a common sense, compassionate and humorous approach to making living happily with any dog easier to achieve."},{"Title":"Mutts: America's Dogs","review":"This book solidified my desire to bypass dogs with fancy &quot;brand names&quot; and go to my local shelter to pick up a mutt. The statement that eight million mutts are killed each year because no one wants them made me determined to save a dog from being killed. I am now the proud owner of a lovely mutt-of-all-mutts. Both her parents are suspected to be mutts, and she's a mix of so many breeds we can't even figure out what might be in her heritage.I loved this book because it didn't just tell you to get a mutt, it told you why mutts are the logical choice. It pointed out reasons such as better health, goodwill, and it provided countless examples of hero mutts. This book would make any mutt owner proud of owning one and many purebred owners envious. My favorite story in the book was about &quot;Susan and Joe,&quot; the tale of a Great Dane-German Shepherd who helps a multiple sclerosis inflicted woman lead a normal life. Very heartwarming!Toward the end of the book there are some chapters that tell you how to select a dog and how to stop some common behavior problems. The advice offered there does not go into great detail, though. You'll certainly need some other books to help you raise a mutt, but this book offers a good start.Finally, the book contained great pictures and was set up in a way that was easy to read and definitely not boring. The print was fairly large, and the book was separated into many sections so you could easily find your way through it. The book was also humorous at times, making for a very enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Mutts: America's Dogs","review":"I like the point made that non-pure bred dogs are wonderful and worth saving. However some of the &quot;catalogue&quot; of mixes was ridiculous. Example: comments on &quot;chow-sharpei&quot; mix and &quot;chow&quot; mixes was obviously due to the fact that the author does not like either breed. I have a chow/samoyed mix who is absolutely wonderful - got the best of both breeds. It would have been more fair to catalogue as well the good points of the breed and perhaps explain more as to why certain breeds can have negative points (poor breeding, socialization &amp; training for example)."},{"Title":"Mutts: America's Dogs","review":"If you are the owner or a fan of mixed breed dogs, you've scoured the shelves for a volume that covers your interest, probably with little success. This book addresses that shortcoming, and does it with grand style and a lot of good humour. I was originally skeptical, wondering how anyone could write a book about dogs that are always different from the next, but Kilcommons pulls it off. Packed with photos, celebrity mutts, descriptions of various 'blends' and some helpful training info, I found a lot to like and learn here. Easy to read, and a great book to have lying about when your purebred-owning friends stop by. It made me proud to have my wonderful mongrel."},{"Title":"Mutts: America's Dogs","review":"This is a must read for those who would love to know what kinds of behaviors to expect with mixed breed dogs. Also, the authors explain how to choose a dog or puppy from a pound. I loved the facts, stories and layout of the book. It was a quick read, highly entertaining and a must read for all who love dogs."},{"Title":"Mutts: America's Dogs","review":"I always have to describe my dogs in terms of purebreds. This has never sat well with me. My dog is a mutt. She is medium sized, fluffy and white. This satisfies none of her admirers - she has to be part border collie or australian shepherd in order to slake their curiousity. What is is it with people, why does breeding matter? Yep, she probably has some border collie in her, but she cannot/will not herd (she is stubborn) and hates chasing balls and frisbees - she ain't no stinking border collie.Oh well, it is nice to have this book for some mutt pride. Yeah, there is not a purebred in my house - but I have this in common with most american families! My dog is known as 'white dog' in this book - and that's enough for me!"},{"Title":"Mutts: America's Dogs","review":"I have a whole library of dog books, and this is by far my favorite. Training and advice about adoption are touched upon in this book, but even more so, there are heartwarming stories, and very humorous descriptions of different types of mixed breeds (including a section titled &quot;hybrids are like Honda accords&quot;. I would (and do!) recommend this book to anyone who likes dogs. It is one I pick up again and again when I need a good laugh."},{"Title":"Mutts: America's Dogs","review":"Mutts: America's Dogs is superbly written, and validates what wemutt owners already know: Mutts are best! Thank you to theauthors for suggesting that mutts are better than pure breedsin a lot of ways, and for telling people how to adopt a wonderfulpet from an animal shelter rather than going to a breeder.I hope this begins to solve the pet over-population problem in someway."},{"Title":"Mutts: America's Dogs","review":"This is by far the best written and most interesting dog book I have ever read. It proves that mutts are by far better companions then purebreds will ever be. It has wonderful stories from life saver mutts to pepsi retrievers (my personal favorite story). It's a must buy for any mutt or even purebred owner!"},{"Title":"Mutts: America's Dogs","review":"I've read this book cover to cover more than once, and laughed out loud each time. The authors' love of dogs shines through every page, and the humor is razor sharp and based on experience. For anyone researching dogs as a first step toward bringing home a canine companion -- purebred or mixed -- this book is a great resource (and great entertainment too)."},{"Title":"Mutts: America's Dogs","review":"This is a well written book about the intelligence possessed by mixed-breed dogs. They are courageous animals that are protective of their owners and eager to please. After reading the inspiring stories in this wonderful book, I will only own mutts in the future. Delightful Book!"},{"Title":"Mutts: America's Dogs","review":"The authors clearly love dogs. Some of the stories and testimonies left me in tears. However, as others have noted, some of the material in this book is not to be taken 100% seriously. Looking beyond that, they do make a great case for the mixed-breed dog -- a case that needs to be made at this time."},{"Title":"Mutts: America's Dogs","review":"A somewhat interesting book if you do not know anything about mixed breed dogs. I do, and was looking for a book which had more photographs of mixed breed dogs, identified by their &quot;parentage.&quot; I also know about animal cruelty, and was shocked to find on page 102, in the sidebar, a story about a Confederate soldier who was due to be executed and whose last request to Union soldiers -- that he be allowed to say goodbye to his dog -- was not only denied, but as the Confederate soldier was led away, his dog was beaten to death by the Union soldiers &quot;with their rifle butts.&quot; I did not expect to find this sort of material in such a book, and wish I had never read it. The story is supposed to illustrate how the soldier was saved by &quot;seeing&quot; the dog's ghost, but it left me wishing I hadn't known about it."},{"Title":"The Causes of the Civil War","review":"some drivel, some repetitive and others stunning with fresh insight. Impossible to characterize as biased because of the variety of sources. What is called the &quot;American Civil War&quot; is a complex event which is difficult to untangle from all that preceded or followed it. The self-rightousness, aggrandizing commercial motives of the North were often masked as moral crusades and the theme emerged time and time again as I read. I would have to add this as a &quot;must read&quot; for anyone who is serious about scholarship of the period."},{"Title":"The Causes of the Civil War","review":"This book is concise, and gives the causes of the Civil War. Stampp is a very well respected and well informed. Stampp gives the reader a quick yet through breakdown of the causes of the Civil War. I used this book as a source in writing a paper on the Causes of the Civil War (undergrad) and it was very helpful. This is useful for those interested in American History."},{"Title":"The Causes of the Civil War","review":"This book is a seminal work for any student of the Civil War. It gives the opinions of those that actually lived through it, opinions from before, during, and after the war. These opinions are conflicting of course. For me it was not the type of book you can just sit down and read but rather a book to browse from time to time. An absolutely fascinating book."},{"Title":"The Causes of the Civil War","review":"I'm sort of surprised at the first two reviews. The first gentleman refers to the book as \\"drivel,\\" even though Stampp used mostly primary sources. The second reviewer falls victim to the Neo-Confederate idea that slavery had nothing to do with the American Civil War--while clumsily avoiding the incredible mountain of primary sources that prove slavery WAS an issue. Stampp's book is a cornerstone of Civil War Historiography, and any serious student of the American Civil War would do well to read this excellent book. Don't be put off by the fact that The Causes of the Civil War was originally a textbook--it is both readable, and a quick read."},{"Title":"The Causes of the Civil War","review":"I rather enjoyed this resource about the Civil war and the era preceding and following. I found the use of articles, journal entries, letters, speeches and historic documents from multiple centuries rather valuable. To see how the perception of the Civil War has changed over the past 150 years is fascinating and watching the trend of history revisionism, conservatism, and liberalism that directly affects how we address history and teach history. I believe this book should be a staple in a Univeristy classroom that educates about this era. I say let the students see multiple sources and let them make their own conclusions on who is \\"guilty, innocent, and caught in the middle\\". Too often we are given one perspective on a very diverse and complicated event and we are supposed to accept a simple reason for it. There is much more to the politics and secession issues within the Confederacy and the Union. This book allows a student to see how both the North and South have their faults in this conflict."},{"Title":"The Causes of the Civil War","review":"Sure, just another book that on one hand tells us that only a small minority of Quaker 'fanatics' were abolitionists, and that the war was over expansion and not slavery, and then the next minute have us all believe that Union troops faught and died to end slavery when in many of their hometowns there were laws that forbid blacks, Indians, and mulatooes from staying in town after sundown. If you believe that people died for this, then you need to be reading bedtime stories. The war was fought over MONEY, POWER, and caused by disagreement between Constitutional Federalists and Jeffersonians. Even the Supreme Court ruled that secession was allowed under the Constitution (in 1862 I believe), but in their ruling said basically that 'this is our ruling, but to no avail, because the issue is being decided on the battlefields as we speak'."},{"Title":"Rocky Point Murders","review":"A collection of short stories about an especially beautiful and unusually creepy part of the Central California coastline. The writers have a good time giving readers the shivers, but underlying it all is a macabre sense of humor, expressed well in the tongue-in-cheek introduction. It's fun, it's well-written, and whether or not you are familiar with the California coast between Big Sur and the Monterey Peninsula, you can lose yourself in the sinister ambience of the Rocky Point Inn."},{"Title":"Rocky Point Murders","review":"I loved these spooky short stories. A great collection of local (California coastline) lore, headlines, humor and jolts of horror. I'd love to give details, but that would spoil your enjoyment. Great for bedtime reading, if you don't mind sleepless nights. Give a copy to the adult trick-or-treaters on your block. I know my holiday gift-giving just got easier."},{"Title":"Rocky Point Murders","review":"I was a bit hesitant to pick up this book. Many times, local unknowns try to get their stories into a book just so they can say, &quot;Hey look! I'm a published author!&quot; But 'author' is NOT what I would call the many previous stories I've read from local 'unknowns.' However....I'm happy to say that I was surprised --- VERY surprised --- at the quality of stories in this book. Most can be read in about ten or fifteen minutes. Almost all of them are well crafted and can send a chill up your spine. My personal favorite was 'Personals' by McKenzie Moss. It focused on the relationship of a woman and a man, both of whom have some heavy baggage coming into their 'relationship' (if you can call it that). It reminded me a bit of Fatal Attraction...but with a twist. And the story was well rounded.This is not to say that I didn't enjoy any of the others! Quite the contrary. The first three stories in the book stand out in my mind, even now.So if you're worried that these stories might not be up to par in the literary world, don't be. These writers deserve the title of 'author' in my opinion."},{"Title":"Rocky Point Murders","review":"This was a quick and intriguing read. I enjoyed all the stories, particularly Mckenzie Moss' &quot;Personals.&quot; Great fun!"},{"Title":"Rocky Point Murders","review":"A fantastic book written by some of today's best authors.We especially like the passages written by award-winning author, McKenzie Moss.

This novel centers around the Dorsai warrior Corunna El Mann. He is supervising the transport of an important dignitary to a planet that is undergoing some internal conflict. When El Mann gets to the planet, political chaos occurs.It seems that the soldiers that were trained to defend a fort have deserted to help the revolutionaries. As a result, this leaves a handful of people left to defend this fortress. There are a total of five Dorsai, one of which is opposed to using weapons. This person is named Michael, and he is in charge of the band.As the days unfold, this novel is really a book centered around the development of characters. There is not much action going on this this novel, except for the final battle scenes. This novel acutally plays more on in the internal conflict of one individual who battles what his morals are, and what his training would have him do. As a result, the book is a great study in socio-ethical conflicts located within an individual. It is easy reading, without a lot of intense descriptions. Overall, it was just an average novel.The book also contained the short story &quot;Warrior&quot;. The story is very easy to read, and should be used in conjunction with other Dorsai novels. The main purpose of this story is to develop the character of Ian Graeme, and further solidify his image. Again, this is easy reading, but you catch a glipse of the unique and intelligent thinking processes that Ian contains."},{"Title":"The Zebra-Striped Whale with the Polka-Dot Tail","review":"I read this book to my five children and they were so enchanted with the story.

As with 'The Giving Tree', there's a moral behind the story of Maxime and Ariel's adventure with the 'whale with a polka-dot tail.'

So when I accidentally came across this book on Amazon I was delighted with the cover, which promised great collage illustrations, and wondered why our library didn't own it when most of the reviews sounded great. So I had our collections department order it, hoping I could use it for story time.What a letdown! I still like the illustrations (well, most of them--one or two look like the author-illustrator was just messing with paint). So I'll give it one star for those. But the text is so strange it just made me say \\"What the heck?\\" If I read it for story time I'm pretty sure the parents in the room would just look at me like I was nuts, or spouting some weird new-age stuff that no one could understand. It's sad, because I actually liked the concept and the message about \\"not all that glitters is gold\\". But frankly, the writing is pretty bad. It sounds like the hallucinations of someone who over-indulged in something stronger than ice cream.Don't believe the good reviews--I'm sorry I spent the library's money on this one."},{"Title":"The Zebra-Striped Whale with the Polka-Dot Tail","review":".

The paperback's blurbs focused on Jaffe's \\"ecological detective thriller.\\" But I found most compelling the seamlessness of the book's widely-informed joined elements -- including biographical and political sketches of great pith, accessible population biology, and a good-scientists-versus-stupid-and-finally-thwarted-others story.The ecological culprit was not some natural substance, and not even one of homo sapiens' products (the book's index lists only three references to DDT). Nor was he us. But he was (and is) one of our fellows -- a little predator incredibly well adapted to feeding on birds' eggs.After the paucity and untimeliness of the governmental response to the Guamanian situation had sunk into my consciousness, it seemed ironic that the book ends with the United States Air Force establishing a 50-acre \\"environmental reclamation experiment\\" on Guam which Jaffe hopes will provide the setting for much more effective research on the culprit. Like The Lord of the Flies ends with her majesty's warship rescuing from themselves the band of island-stranded, warring boys."},{"Title":"M*A*S*H Goes to New Orleans","review":"\\"MASH goes to Paris\\" is one of several sequels to the original \\"MASH\\" novel that were hastily written to cash-in on the then-recent TV series. These novels picked up where the original book left off and have very little to do with the TV series aside from a handful of characters like Hawkeye, Trapper John, Radar, etc. Many fans (myself included) suspect that original author Hooker had very little to do with these books and that the bulk of them were really written by coauthor Butterworth.This particular novel starts off ok, with five of the key MASH characters (Hawkeye, Trapper, Radar, Henry Blake, and Hot Lips) reuniting in a somewhat contrived fashion during the early 1970s. The reunion of these characters is poignant in that we get a glimpse into what they might have done after leaving the 4077 back in Korea. This is also the best-written section of the novel. The rest, unfortunately, is what my theater professor would have called an \\"accent comedy.\\" Regional and ethnic stereotypes abound in the same way that they did in certain mainstream slapstick-style film comedies of the late 1960s. These characters, all drawn in broad cartoony strokes, are piled on one after another and eventually crowd out the original MASH cast.If you are a completist and can get this cheap, by all means do so. Otherwise, you probably ought to stay away."},{"Title":"Rethinking Intelligence","review":"If you are looking for a book to expand your ideas about education beyond hackneyed discussions of NCLB and longer school days, then Kincheloe's RETHINKING INTELLIGENCE is a great choice. The essays in this collection are effective for the following reasons: 1) they uncover assumptions about education; 2) they highlight the cultural dynamics at work in the construction of educational theory; and 3) they point to practices, such as the \\"validation\\" of certain types of knowledge and modes of presentation, and the ways these practices serve some students and disserve others.Most notable in this collection is Suzanne Gallagher's \\"An Exchange of Gazes.\\" In this essay, Gallagher engages in a Foucauldian analysis of our system of teacher education with a focus on educational psychology. Gallagher skillfully uncovers the \\"taken-for-granted\\" ways of thinking in our current system. She points out that scientists are behind these theories, and that these scientists are people with \\"ideological, political, and cultural biases.\\" Questions about education, Gallagher asserts, are engineered from specific socio-political locations. These questions are then recast as \\"objective\\" inquiry. As Gallagher aptly states, \\"[E]ducational psychologist seem to forget that they do not discover but invent the knowledge they apply.\\"\\"[T]he educational apparatus still marches to its drummer,\\" Philip Wexler writes, \\"without any knowledge or embarrassment of the small place of this particular discourse in the historical human drama.\\" Wexler's introduction serves as an apropos opening to this collection of essays, a collection which uses \\"post-formal thought\\" to subvert the \\"domination of education by cognitive psychology.\\" Reader beware: Rethinking is a academic text. As such, it relies heavily on post-positive and post-modernist jargon. Rethinking is Foucault'sDiscipline & Punish: The Birth of the Prisonmeets Delpit'sOther People's Children: Cultural Conflict in the Classroom, Updated Edition, with a pinch of Illich'sDeschooling Society (Open Forum).The essays in Rethinking go beyond bandaging inequality and \\"achievement gaps\\" with budget and policy proposals. These essays work like holistic medicine. They analyze the entire system of educational psychology and then ferret out the cause of our current woes."},{"Title":"The Cat That Changed My Life: 50 Cats Talk Candidly About How They Became Who They Are","review":"This book is a literary masterpiece.

They admit that yes, they ARE \\"vain, decadant and self absorbed with few redeeming qualities, and many quirks\\", and they are quite happy to reside in this mode. One likes to lie flat on her belly and chew on my exercise bench when she is not sitting spellbound, listening to my female country music singer CD's. The other, a long haired foundling, likes to fill the hallways with her self-pitying wails. I have sometimes found my keys and my charge cards under their food mats..... They do delight in their personal perversions. And then again, am I, their human, considered by them to be any less bizarre?Anyway, they allowed me to read this book to them, and after the last page, they stopped what they were doing long enough to lie on their backs and wiggle their paws in the air, giving this book an unprecedented 8 Paw Salute. Then they went back to their usual routines.They insisted that they have KNOWN some of the book's characters personally, and tell me that BEK did a fine job -- for a human, that is -- in portraying the many twisted and not-so-twisted personalites of these feline individuals. They also want to know how much these cats were paid to be interviewed.Was their enjoyment of this book a one-time phenomenon? I doubt it -- As I started to re-shelve this wonderful little book the other night, one of my cats, who lay fully stretched out on my side of the bed said in her breathy catnip-tinged voice \\"Read it again, Sam.\\" I was so shocked when I heard her say that -- now, I want to know who this Sam is......Buy this book, even if you DON'T have any cats to read it to.

The publisher of ALibrarycat.com recommends it:What would happen if you went around the country asking cats of all personality types one simple question: Who was the cat that had the most significant effect on your life, and why?In the delightfully charming book, The Cat That Changed My Life: 50 Cats Talk Candidly About How They Became Who They Are, illustrator and writer Bruce Eric Kaplan has captured what appears to be the secret personality of many a cat. Like the Broadway musical and film Cats, the felines described in the book have many human qualities - some good, some not so good.As Kaplan is an illustrator by profession, the book is set up in a very visual way with a picture of a cat on the right side of the book and a short passage of text on the opposite side. Fifty cats, fifty stories. Each of the felines is unique, and whether we approve or disapprove of the cat that had the most significant effect on their lives, the stories are so emotionally powerful it's impossible to forget a single one.My personal favorite is the story of Milton (from White Plains, New York). Milton writes about a friend who always suggested they climb a faraway tree with incredibly good bark, but somehow the friend kept making excuses and they never found or climbed this tree.One day, Milton learns his friend had been put to sleep. Shocked and disturbed, he finds the tree, climbs it, and rubs every part of himself against the tree's texture, vowing to never put off doing anything again. Later, Milton learns that his friend isn't dead - she had spread the rumor because she didn't want to see Milton. Though surprised by this ironic twist, Milton is glad for the lie because the whole experience made him feel more fulfilled and appreciate life.This cutely illustrated, clever book is short but packs a powerful punch. It is a delightful gift for a cat-loving friend or a book to pull out when you need to take a lesson from the felines."},{"Title":"The Cat That Changed My Life: 50 Cats Talk Candidly About How They Became Who They Are","review":"I originally stumbled across this book in a little bookstore.

Cats are one of my passions, and I am writing a novel with cats as protagonists, \\"Warriors\\" notwithstanding.Kaplan writes from inside the cats' personalities without being anthropromorphic. I throught the cats were really trying to communicate just how they felt.Of course, the book is a fable although not necessarily one that converys a moral. But it smacks of truth because we cats--we who are human, that is--have known cats that have changed our lives, whether they were cat cats or other humans. I know my cat, Millie, has changed my life in many ways, one being that I tell the truth more now than I ever have. Cats cannot lie, and they make you know that by punctuating their truths with teeth marks and scratches. Whenever I see my wounds, I am reminded to tell the absolute truth. Kaplan's cats cannot lie either, so you can believe what they tell you without concern.In my years as a cat fancier I have come to what I consider an unassailable conclusion: cats are closer to us in thought and deed than any other animal except, maybe, chimps and gorillas. Kaplan re-enforces that conclusion for me in his book.Each cat he interviewed spoke as an individual and expressed hopes and fears, tolerance and prejudice, love and hate--every emotion and characteristic that is human.I love this book, which can be read in one sitting, but enjoyed in contemplation forever. By the way, my cat, Millie, loved it, too."},{"Title":"The Cat That Changed My Life: 50 Cats Talk Candidly About How They Became Who They Are","review":"The book not exactly chicken soup for the soul for cats but it's a great gift for cat lovers.

I obtained the book shortly before the hostile festivities broke out in Iraq and gave it a read. While I do not agree with all of its content, and do not espouse or support some of the book's more objectionable forms of advocacy and support of certain causes, I did find the text to have particular insight into some of the problems, well-publicized or not, that all of us on the planet face.The book seeks to redefine travel and tourism not as opportunities to escape, take a break or unwind but as chances to learn and connect with others. The text places a lot of weight on communion and solidarity with the down-trodden in the Third World. I regard these to be admirable sentiments, but I object to the author's advocating that readers should put themselves in harm's way to engage and confront pressing world problems. While visiting war-torn or strife-filled areas does indeed have its merits (first-hand eyewitness accounts and whatnot), these areas are inherently dangerous, and the natives may question your sincerity for being there (if they do not harm you directly or indirectly regardless of your sincere intentions).Some have rightly criticized the approach advocated by the authors, but no one can heap abuse upon them for the reasoning behind it. We often receive a biased account of things and events from traditional and established media sources, and we should, wherever possible, seek out all forms of information wherever possible. However, I do not think that such information gathering should legitimately include putting oneself in harm's way, but this is just my opinion.The real value of the text rests in its exposure of the exploitative aspects of tourism, especially in the developing countries and the Third World. Granted, we do not travel in order to see other people's problems (as we generally travel to get away from our own problems for the most part), and when we do take a break in an exotic foreign locale, it is with the purpose of having fun in mind. However, we must also keep in mind that our desire to have fun often comes at the expense of others and their environment, and our travel dollars often do not benefit the natives of the exotic locale at all. Rather, concerted effort has been taken to exclude them from the tourist experience at every conceivable opportunity.While the book does delve into the exploitative nature of tourism in the Third World, one does not have to go outside the country to see just how a dependence on tourism ravages an economy and demeans and exploits a group of people. Anyone who has traveled to Hawaii can see this very easily.Although the focus on tourism is a big theme of the book, the book also devotes space to ways in which those in the First World can connect with those in the Third World, chiefly through things like Fair Trade outlets featuring goods from a particular country or region, or through grassroots organizations. Much of the content, however, does reflect a lot of the misplaced idealism of the middle to late 1970s and early 1980s. Most notably, a few of the pictures, particularly those of idealistic young men and women sporting afros (complete with afro-piks!) and bell-bottom pants, gave me a few chuckles. I have no problems with ideaslism, and I believe it to be a good thing, so long as it is grounded in the real world and put to practical use and sensible use.So, in spite of its dated nature and at times idealistic rhetoric, I liked the book. The reading was a little dense at times, but the topics were important and dead-on. The text forced me to think deeply about some topics and issues that I previously had not considered, or simply had given short shrift. Once again, I do not recommend that people place themselves in harm's way to obtain information, or show 'solidarity' with some dubious cause, as this book advocates, but I do encourage people to read this book, and reconsider the whole idea behind such things as eco-tourism, romance tourism, and sex tourism, and what effect such activities have on the people of the Third World."},{"Title":"Bridging the Global Gap: A Handbook to Linking Citizens of the First and Third Worlds","review":"The internet changed everything, and it changes issues raised in this book (example -- the Twitter domino democracy starting in Egypt). Today you can go on 'virtual tours' so basing an entire 'bridge' economy on tourism shows a fundamental misunderstanding of the first and third worlds. The problems of inequality stem from the lines of governmental forms and corruption, as opposed to increasingly spendy upbeat tourists (which the book focused on). The internationalist movement described had little real power, because the people involved were persecuted by their respective regimes.In short, an older idealism even back in it's day. Outdated and not worth reading, unless you are interested in the political-based advertising of third world tourism in the 1970-1980's."},{"Title":"Bridging the Global Gap: A Handbook to Linking Citizens of the First and Third Worlds","review":"This is a completely unrealistic book that doesn't seem to grasp why the first world IS the first world."},{"Title":"The Great Wells of Democracy: The Meaning of Race in American Life","review":"This book was required for my African American class at college, and I bought it on Amazon.com because it was in my budget.

Best days of my life are with a trout stream, rod and this book."},{"Title":"The compleat angler =: Or The contemplative man's recreation","review":"Three hundred fifty years ago Izaak Walton wrote of the curious blend of inner peace and giddy excitement which the amateur naturalist finds at streamside. He invites us to stroll with him through the countryside, discussing the mythology, superstition, and the science of England's aquatic fauna. It is an unrushed journey, though we often arise at sunrise, and the author introduces us to many of the local inhabitants. Indeed, if our fishing is successful, we might exchange our catch for the song of a pretty milkmaid. The Compleat Angler is a brief book, and Walton's intent is to hook the reader, and encourage him to try fishing for himself: \\"I do not undertake to say all that is known...but I undertake to acquaint the Reader with many things that are not usually known to every Angler; and I shall leave gleanings and observations enough to be made out of the experience that all that love and practise this recreation, to which I shall encourage them.\\" Interestingly, Walton starts off on the defensive, since the fisherman's passion was even then caricatured. By the end the reader has joined the \\"Brotherhood of the Angle,\\" making artificial flies and enjoying the poetry of fishing: \\"The jealous Trout, that low did lie, Rose at a well-dissembled fly.\\" To the modern ear Walton's literal belief in naturalists' old wives tales may seem humorously anachronistic, and it comprises a remarkably large part of his affection for his subject. We are also frequently reminded of the book's timeline with comments such as \\"...the Royal Society have found and published lately that there be thirty and three kinds of Spiders,\\" while we now know that there are thirty thousand species of Arachnids. And the Brotherhood of the Angle is a genuine fraternity to Walton, \\"...I love all Anglers, they be such honest, civil, quiet men.\\" The prospective reader must also be disabused of the misconception that Walton was a purist for artificial lures; he strongly recommends worms, minnows, and live flies. In Walton's watery world there is no dry humor, only fresh. Following his description of the twelve most effective artificial flies he says, \\"Thus you have a jury of flies likely to betray and condem all the Trouts in the river.\\" And here he compares the beautiful coloration of a living trout to...well, you'll see: \\"Their bodies [are] adorned with such red spots, and...with black or blackish spots, as give them such an addition of natural beauty as, I think, was never given to any woman by the artificial paint or patches in which they so much pride themselves in this age.\\" At the risk of taking some of the surprise out of the book, I here present a sample of Walton's fishing secrets: \\"Take the stinking oil drawn out of Polypody of the oak by a retort, mixed with turpentine and hive-honey, and anoint your bait therewith, and it will doubtless draw the fish to it.\\" I would guess that Walton wasn't much of a cook, however, and I do not recommend his recipe for eel (partially skinning it, packing the viceral cavity with nutmeg and anchovy, cutting off the head, slipping the skin back over the body, and sewing it together where the head formerly was, then barbecuing it on skewers). Walton's affection for fish and fishing extends beyond the aquatic nobility of trout and salmon, to the often ignored commoners: gudgeons, sprats, bleaks, herns, tench, roach, umber, loach, and sticklebag. And as for the importance of fishing in Walton's world: \\"I envy not him that eats better meat than I do, nor him that is richer, or that wears better clothes than I do; I envy nobody but him, and him only, that catches more fish than I do.\\""},{"Title":"The compleat angler =: Or The contemplative man's recreation","review":"If you don't know about this famous book by the inimitable Walton, you have a lot to look forward to. Purporting to be an account of a 5-day fishing idyll (when gentlemen were gentle men, and the English countryside was at once bountiful and near to hand), it is in fact a deeply engaging nostalgia trip into a never-never land of pastoral bliss -- an enduring cult classic having no exact parallel in world literature.To say \\"evocative of simpler, happier times\\" is to barely hint at the near-mystical fragrance of this enchanting volume. Three high-spirited protagonists (\\"Piscator\\", \\"Venator\\", and \\"Auceps\\"), devoted to three rival outdoor avocations (fishing, hunting, and falconing, respectively), meet on a \\"fine, fresh May morning\\"; ramble across the countryside in search of lively fishing and hearty times; sing, banter, and versify; recount ancient wisdom (of often dubious validity) regarding the habits and temper of over a dozen local fish species; and encounter a classic sampling of innkeepers, milkmaids, gypsies, and various other idealized rural types. This is a refuge book for quiet evenings, one of those unaccountably transporting narratives of which no charmed reader has ever wanted to reach the end.Some history: stolen in parts from precedents written as far back as 1450, Walton's work is nearly as early as it could be and still be readable without a line-by-line explanatory gloss (\\"compleat\\" is about as arcane as it gets). First published in 1653, there have been well over 100 editions in print. Some of the earlier ones contain Lang's sensitive and informative 28-page introduction to the author's life, the structure of the work, and its publishing history. Noteworthy are the 80+ illustrations produced by Sullivan (again, available in some of the older editions and their reprints), which are unselfconsciously exquisite: naively rendered country scenes and character sketches; finely wrought studies of dry flies and of the various species of fish mentioned in the book; and ornately framed images of famous fishermen \\"taken\\" from the evidently superb engraved portraits of Major's 1824 edition.The author was a minor legend in his own time. Held in the highest regard by all who knew him, this \\"excellent old man\\" suffered many tragedies throughout his long life (from the public murder of his beloved king to various family deaths and personal debilities), but he never lost his rare sweetness of temper. He wrote numerous other treatises, but \\"The Compleat Angler\\" early on rendered him a literary immortal."},{"Title":"The compleat angler =: Or The contemplative man's recreation","review":"I'm flyfisher in Korea.

In a word, Full content, Good price!"},{"Title":"The compleat angler =: Or The contemplative man's recreation","review":"I have had this book beside me for more than 20 years, not for its guidance about fishing (though this is pleasant), but for the simple, unaffected but eloquent beauty of its 17th century prose. A lovely, idealized, Arcadian sort of England comes to life, and it is a very nice place in which to dip your mind a while."},{"Title":"The compleat angler =: Or The contemplative man's recreation","review":"This is surely one of the earliest books available to the modern angler. But it's worth distinguishing 'anglers' from 'fishermen'. I take 'anglers' to be people who go after fish for fun or sport or pleasure and 'fishermen' to be people who go after fish for work.The first thing to be said about Izaak Walton's book, is that it is a play followed by a text book. The second thing, is that it's in a foreign language even to the English, because it was first published in 1653 when the author was 60. A ripe old age in England in those days.Walton was essentially a biographer. He got paid for it - often commissioned as a good artist might. He wrote 'The Life of Donne' - a poet who even I've heard of. He's alleged to have been a prosperous merchant, but it doesn't really matter. Great angling writers like Richard Walker were engineers. Old school writers like George Skues, were public school educated solicitors in London practices who took the train to the chalk streams of Winchester in Hampshire at weekends, tying flies as they went.The play concerns three people who meet by chance and get into conversation about their interests. They're travelling at a walk, and so they lighten their journey with convoluted conversation. Before long, it develops into a bit of a competition. Walton is the angler (Piscator). Another gentleman is keen on falconry (Venator) and yet another is keen on hunting (Auceps).If you tire of 17th century banter, skip forward to the chapters on each particular species of fish, which will ring true immediately. To me it's a revelation that these friendly old fish will still fall for the same tricks as Walton was playing on their ancestors over 350 years ago."},{"Title":"The compleat angler =: Or The contemplative man's recreation","review":"This book is to fishing as military music is to music. True, THE COMPLEAT ANGLER does discuss the various aspects then current in England, but any focus on fishing was secondary to giving a combination of practical advice, pastoral fantasy, and good-humored piety. The book is a dialogue with 3 speakers: Piscator (the angler), Venator (the hunter), and Aucer (the falconer). Frequently, Walton abandons the dialogue and simply presents Piscator giving some very long instructional speeches on a plethora of topics ranging from angling to cooking to just about anything else under the sun. Walton is not bashful about inserting poetry of Raleigh, Donne, Drayton, Herbert, and many others. Piscator is not simply the champion of angling; he is pious, a moralizer, a gourmand, a singer, and above all, a lover of the lovely British countryside. Further, he is unflaggingly polite and upbeat. His duty to God is never more than one sentence from his tongue. He drops quotes from the Bible the way a Vegas gambler drops chips at the blackjack table. Since Piscator was so clearly drawn as the prototypical Englishman, it is no surprise that all Englishman saw in him more than a bit of themselves and correspondingly loved him. Non-English readers are often puzzled as to why he was so widely read. First, even non-fishermen can share in the joy with which he expounds the mysteries of angling. Next, he is a genuine lover of country sights and sounds. Finally, he embodies the temperamental qualities on which the English place such huge store: he is kindly, tolerant, patient, one who interferes with nobody and asks nothing better than to be allowed to enjoy his hobby in peace. His style of writing includes a fondness for writing a balanced, parallel sentence with much frolicsome humor. THE COMPLEAT ANGLER is a work full of digressions and a fondness for the fabulous natural history derived from Pliny the Elder, so much so that we might wonder whether so credulous a man could be a trustworthy biographer. Yet, it is this unsophisticated and uncritical inclusiveness of vast masses of unrelated and unverified data that constitutes one of its great charms."},{"Title":"The compleat angler =: Or The contemplative man's recreation","review":"The Complete Angler - Izaak Walton and Chalres CottonThis book deserves a place in a collection of great angling books, such as those of John Geirach, Henry Middleton and Scott Waldie. It is really two books and an odd sort of middle section on property rights and fishing (funny how some issues have not changed much since the late 17th century). It has some wonderful discourses on not just fishing but the lifestyle and philosophy of fishing. There are some sections and descriptions that can be tedious but they minor compared to the overall wonderful dialogue of the majority of the book.The first section is written by Izaak Walton and, to me, was Canterbury Tales-esque, is it's older English language (which is entertainingly preserved) and its format. Three travelers - a fisherman (angler), hunter and falconer meet. In the course of discussing the merits of their activities the angler convinces the hunter to come along fishing with him (after seeing a hunt with hounds). Over the course of a few days on the rivers of England, the angler turns the hunter to the quiet joys of angling. He goes through the fish in England and all the baits and methods of fishing for them as well as how to prepare each of them. I had never through of carp of chubs and fish to eat, but after some of the descriptions in this book, I may have to give the a second look someday. The first book is as much of a celebration of the social and contemplative nature of angling as it is descriptions and methods of fishing. Interspersed are encounters with the local farmers, milker and inn-keepers as well as the talking over of the days activities among friends. But the highlight of this first section, and in my opinion the entire book, is the parting words of the angler to the hunter of how angling is a life philosophy that departs sharply from the hustle and bustle of the capitalist life. The first book is replete with references to early Christianity and its admonitions against looking to wealth for happiness.There is an odd middle section about property rights and fishing which serves as a rather odd bridge to Charles Cotton's section. This book focuses on fishing for trout and graylings in a small section of England. If found the wordy descriptions of the flies by month to be tedious and the lack of philosophical discussion of fishing to be a little disappointing of an end."},{"Title":"The compleat angler =: Or The contemplative man's recreation","review":"Five days of fishing along the river Lea which joins the Thames near London is the background on which the cheerful narrative of The Compleat Angler is laid. The splendid civil conversation of Latin named Piscator, Venator, Auceps, Viator, and Piscator Junior is a joy to hear. Shakespeare was just publishing his first work when Izaak Walton was born in 1593 in Stafford. Walton retired in his early fifties and traveled about rural England visiting friends, fishing, and writing in his easy-going fashion. After publication of The Compleat Angler in 1653 he continued to add to it in his leisurely way for the next quarter century. Samuel Johnson praised the book in the eighteenth century and later Charles Lamb recommended The Compleat Angler to Samuel Taylor Coleridge. 'It breathes the very spirit of innocence, purity, and simplicity of heart,' he noted. 'It would sweeten a man's temper at any time to read it; it would Christianise every angry, discordant passion; pray make yourself acquainted with it.'The Compleat Angler is a true classic of English literature that owes it's esteem not to advice about fishing but to Izaak Walton's pre-occupations and exquisite manner. Subtitled The Contemplative Man's Recreation the pages glow with delight in the hills and dales, woods and streams of the beloved countryside. Walton conveys a message of meek thankful fellowship and peace to all \\"honest, civil, quiet men\\". 'The Compleat Angler is not about how to fish but about how to be,' said novelist Thomas McGuane. 'Walton spoke of an amiable mortality and rightness on the earth that has been envied by his readers for three hundred years.'"},{"Title":"The compleat angler =: Or The contemplative man's recreation","review":"Whilst this edition/reprint includes the Charles Cotton supplement, the print quality is abominable.

I was a great short read and very entertaining to read. You really felt the sentiments of the author as it transcends to her characters with genuine earnest and heart."},{"Title":"Agnes Grey (Barnes & Noble Classics Series)","review":"I think many who've read this book attach the word \\"simple\\" to it and its exactly how I describe it. The story is simple, the setting is simple and the heroine is quite simple, but it's Agnes' quiet simplicity and sincere wish for happiness that touches the reader's heart. The novel was not as exciting as Jane Eyre or as \\"shocking\\" as Tenant of Wildfell Hall but I easily read it in 2 days (thanks to the authors excellent prose).One critic was quite right when he praised the intense accuracy of the novel's depiction of the life of a governess. That really is the case since Anne drew on her own experiences to write a novel which revealed the inner thoughts of a woman whose position and life depended on the whims of her employers. Having worked at a daycare for a year at the same age as the protagonist I could relate to the difficulties she encountered with the Bloomfield children and their manipulations.The only thing that bothered me was sometimes the lack of dignity. Agnes has lived a life of isolation with her family and at 19 becomes a governess and so its understandable that at the beginning of her occupation she is timid, and reluctant to stand up to her employers. However, by the end of the novel I was frustrated that Bronte didn't give her a stronger state of mind in which she could assert her freedom and ego. She still chose to suffer the abuses of her employers and do everything they said without voicing her rights or circumstances.The penguin's edition is great. It has a lengthy biographical introduction, a chronology of the lives of the Bronte sisters and notes that add on biographical info that connects to the story.A great classic for fans of Victorian lit', 19th century British literature or Dickens, Bronte and Austen readers."},{"Title":"Agnes Grey (Barnes & Noble Classics Series)","review":"Anne Bronte is probably the least popular Bronte sister for some reason. She actually wrote two books (and Charlotte wrote four) but the only Bronte books anyone ever seems to know are Jane Eyre and Wuthering Heights. Those are by far the most popular and have been adapted many, many times. Unfortunately given Anne's relative obscurity, there are very few adaptations of her works. There are a couple TV versions of her second novel, The Tenant of Wildfell Hall, but only one of those is available on DVD and there are none at all of her first book, Agnes Grey. I think this is a real shame because I love both of Anne's books and because of this, I would say she's my favorite of the three sisters.Agnes Grey tells of the titular character's life as a governess. Her family loses their fortune in an accident and so Agnes decides to work as a governess rather than be a burden on her parents- even though they are against this idea. She first teaches extremely bratty young children (the son is a sociopath who tortures his younger sisters and small animals) and then older, more worldly children. All of her pupils are spoiled to the core, but she gets along well enough with her second family of employment.Like Jane Eyre, Agnes Grey is about a governess, but the two books are very different from each other. Agnes Grey is much more realistic, lacking all the gothic and mysterious elements. Anne based the story and characters on her own experiences as a governess, and thus all the bratty kids are very well realized. Agnes does fall in love but it's a more understated romance with a good man, but nothing like the tumultuous passion between Jane and Rochester. Anne Bronte's books are definitely the most realistic out of all of the Brontes and this one most of all. The style is the closest to Jane Austen that any of them will get, so Jane Austen fans who are not fond of Charlotte and Emily's work will probably respond more favorably to this one. It does have a moral and religious message to it but I didn't find it heavy-handed."},{"Title":"Agnes Grey (Barnes & Noble Classics Series)","review":"Wonderful story and I'm amazed I'd never heard of it before. If you like anything Jane Austen, or Bronte you'll like this one too!"},{"Title":"Agnes Grey (Barnes & Noble Classics Series)","review":"This is a very easy read and I'm glad to say I enjoyed it. I thought I would be irritated by the narrator's \\"goody-two-shoes\\" character, but it was not as bad as I expected. It's also very light reading, so overall quite a satisfying experience. I suppose the sweet love story accounted for most of the four star rating!In general, it reads as though Agnes never grew or developed during the course of the book. However, I think that's probably because the story is told through the voice of an older Agnes, kind of as a recollection of events."},{"Title":"Agnes Grey (Barnes & Noble Classics Series)","review":"Read in May, 2012Agnes Grey is the first novel of Anne Bronte, the youngest of the storied literary clan who produced two of the enduring novels of the 19th century, Wuthering Heights and Jane Eyre. Unlike the stories of her older sisters, Agnes Grey is NOT romantic. In fact, the most striking thing about this novel -- and this author -- is her realism, which anticipates the work of later writers such as George Eliot and Thomas Hardy. Agnes Gray is the daughter of a minister who loses what little money he has in an investment he'd hoped would make him rich. In hopes of helping support the family, Agnes takes a job as a governess, although she has no experience or training for the post. The children in the first family she serves are spoiled and vicious, problems overlooked by their doting mother and arrogant father. The second family are aristocrats and the children are young girls readying themselves for a marriage market, focusing on finding wealthy husbands with titles rather than companions for the journey through life. Anne Bronte's depiction of those families is unsparing, almost reportage rather than entertainment, and the misery of Agnes in their homes is believable and heart-breaking. Eventually, she employs her hard-won wisdom in selecting and capturing a man she can both love and respect. And while the end provides the conventional girl-gets-boy finale, the pages leading up to it offer a stark realism that is quite unusual for a novel first published in 1847."},{"Title":"Agnes Grey (Barnes & Noble Classics Series)","review":"I read this book because I had read \\"Wuthering Heights\\" and \\"Jane Eyre\\" and I wondered what the story was with Anne Bronte, the other novelist Bronte sister. \\"Agnes Grey\\" is very different from the books Anne's sisters wrote. It's lighter and downright funny in parts. Like the other Bronte sisters' books, it features bratty charges of a governess (there are a lot of bratty cousins in Bronte books--I wonder who it was who inspired all those characters). But Agnes herself comes off as a little bit entitled, which winds up being quite funny. \\"Agnes Grey\\" reminds me more of a Jane Austen book than of a Bronte book. If you're a fan of the Bronte's, you should read this book just from a completist standpoint. But even if you're just a fan of the literature of the period, this is a pretty fun read."},{"Title":"Agnes Grey (Barnes & Noble Classics Series)","review":"I've read \\"Jane Eyre\\" and \\"Wuthering Heights\\" and found them dry and unable to hold my interest, which I thought this book might also do.

Her legacy will forever be overshadowed by the greater success of her elder sisters; Charlotte Bronte, the author of \\"Jane Eyre\\", and Emily Bronte, who gave the world \\"Wuthering Heights\\". I would love to be able to say that Anne is the hidden gem of the Bronte family, but the fact is that her work is simply not as good as that of her sisters'. She writes vividly and sympathetically, but ultimately her stories are rather forgettable, especially when compared with the trials and tribulations of Jane Eyre and the violent and passionate love affair between Heathcliff and Catherine in \\"Wuthering Heights\\" (okay, I'll admit it - it's my favourite book. I'm hopelessly biased).Anne Bronte's most famous book \\"Agnes Grey\\", is without the timeless appeal of her sisters' novel, since it is a novel meant for her contemporary Victorian audience, one that underlined the trials and difficulties faced by governesses of the time. At this point in British history, economical and social problems had driven many young women to seek employment as governesses, and because of the influx of potential governesses, families could naturally whittle down the price of a teacher for their children (Charlotte Bronte for example, had to accept twenty pounds a year for her services as a governess). Being one of the first novels to address the hardships and indignities faced by governesses, Anne Bronte's book provided a valuable window into this world; and it did this so well in fact that one critic said of the author: \\"he must have bribed some governess very largely...to reveal to him the secrets of her prison house, or, he must have devoted extraordinary powers of observation and discovery to the elucidation of the subject.\\"In this critic's defense, Anne (along with her sisters) published their books under masculine pen names, but it is a testimony to her skill that the conditions of the governess were captured so vividly. Being a governess herself (with many similarities to her title character, as we shall see in a moment), Anne was in the prime position to \`spill the beans' on the plight of the governess. By today's standards \\"Agnes Grey\\" provides a vivid and interesting history on this aspect of life in Bronte's time period, but it is more valued for its glimpses into the Bronte sisters' lives than its compelling story.Agnes Grey is the story of a young heroine who - because of her family's financial struggles - advertises herself out as a governess. Stepping out into the world from a life surrounded by a loving family is trial enough, but Agnes is looking forward to achieving her independence and helping her family in its time of need. She is sadly disillusioned, as her new position in the Bloomfield household is not at all what she expected. The children are unruly and spoilt, the house servants are unfriendly and the master and the mistress hold Agnes responsible for their children's wild behaviour. Her second position is only moderately better; treated as little more than a servant; she is only gradually accepted by her two new charges: the flirtatious Rosalie and the tomboyish Matilda Murray. Her only spark of light is the sensible young curate Mr Weston, a man whom Rosalie is determined to add to her list of conquests before her upcoming marriage is made public...The similarities between Agnes and Anne's lives are numerous: both are the youngest and adored little sisters of their families (and although all but one of Agnes's siblings are dead, six were born - the same as Anne's family), both had two positions as a governess at two different households and were unfairly dismissed for incompetence from the first one, both are the daughters of North England clergymen, and both are nineteen when they take up their first post. What makes Agnes especially unique in the large canon of literary governesses (of which she was one of the first), is that she is actively enthusiastic about going out into the world and earning money - a trait that is admittedly coupled with a real need to help her family, but one which is rare (most book-governesses are forced reluctantly into their positions). Agnes's situation as the adored little sister of the Grey family is akin to Anne's own place in her family (a position that scholars now believe Anne rebelled against), perhaps accounting for the unique characteristic of Agnes's initial desire to become as a governess - that she actively goes out in search of a job, rather than being helplessly driven to it solely by poverty.There is nothing wrong with Bronte's writing technique - her language is crisp and concise, her heroine realistic and sympathetic, and her social commentary on the plight of the young unmarried Victorian woman's chances at a career is as thought-provoking as ever (though naturally a bit dated by today's standards). The problem lies with the story itself, which is somewhat uneventful. Bronte is particularly good in capturing the frustrations of being governess to a pack of ungrateful children; their naughty behaviour, their disinterestedness and the unfair treatment accorded to her by her employees, but ultimately nothing is done with it. Because it is predominantly an exposition on the requirements and hardships of governesses, we never really get any satisfactorily comeuppance to any of Agnes's pupils, save one, whose unhappy marriage is almost *too* tragic. Anne Bronte's novel is more didactic than that of her sisters', as Agnes is a paragon of virtue and patience in the face of ongoing frustration. Yes, her temper is worn at times, but she is remarkable in her ability to withhold her emotions and keep in place her calm exterior. Just once I would have liked one of the little brats to get slapped! Also, I don't think I'm alone in thinking that Agnes's romance with Mr Weston is a little flat - we never really get to know him very well, and Agnes's falling in love with him is as much a leap of faith on his perceived goodness then any real meeting of minds and hearts.But \\"Agnes Grey\\" is certainly worth the read, for the historical insight as well as a comparative text for Anne Bronte's second novel, the much more rich and accomplished \\"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall.\\"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall (Oxford World's Classics)"},{"Title":"Agnes Grey (Barnes & Noble Classics Series)","review":"I read this book for my freetime and have two points of views to address:The academic in me found the book to contain a good amount of symbols and transgressions worthy of noting in any good size paper.

How she ends up being treated in her role as governess to two families is disrespectfully, making something like the \`Nanny Diaries' look like nothing. Spoiled children whose discipline is lax with parents, who undermine her efforts to improve their behavior. Agnes was hopeful at first, because she thought her place in a household would be one of respect, but governesses had more of an ambiguous social standing.

How they gradually came to be accepted by the children or families they worked with, but they still had to walk a fine line between employee & friend/companion. But the novel has a good message about staying true to yourself, about doing right by others, & there is a romance with a certain vicar, Mr. Weston.I doubt I'll ever re-read \`Agnes Grey', but I do recommend it to those who would like more understanding of the role of a governess & its historical insight into Victorian life."},{"Title":"Agnes Grey (Barnes & Noble Classics Series)","review":"It is unfortunate that one is unable to enjoy this book without comparing it to Jane Eyre or Wuthering Heights; however, it holds it own beauty.I was delighted with the baby sitting scenes and found myself laughing with the narrator, and also feeling all of her pain and anguish.She's &quot;lighter&quot; than her sisters and the ending reminds me a little of a Jane Austen novel.

After being subjected to employers that would put Miranda Pristley in The Devil Wears Prada or the Xs in The Nanny Diaries to shame, Agnes is fired (her gain, I think) and seeks another post, this time at Horton Lodge, where her charges are Miss Rosalie Murray and Miss Miranda Murray. While there, Agnes becomes acquainted with the village's curate, Edward Weston. Its not difficult to guess what happens there.Anne's sister, Charlotte, glamorized and romanticized the life of a governess somewhat in Jane Eyre. Apparently, Anne's description of the tribulations Agnes goes through are nearly true to life. The first few chapters are devoted to Agnes's complaining about the treatment she receives at the hands of the Bloomwood children, but the story picks up when she arrives at Horton Lodge and Rosalie has her coming-out party. Rosalie Morton is another spoiled, selfish brat, but her personality is more fleshed out than those of the Bloomwoods. She provides the perfect contrast to Agnes's demure, subdued demeanor. If you've read Wuthering Heights and/or Jane Eyre, be prepared for the fact that Agnes Grey is a lot more down-to-earth and provincial--it actually reminded me a bit of George Eliot's Middlemarch, or The Mill On the Floss.

Yet it is her calm reportage and her own high principles that mainly impress the reader.With the Murrays her problems are different, and concern mainly the dealings of flirtatious Rosalie, who cares only about finding a suitable husband. Of course she chooses poorly and ends up unhappy. It's Agnes, though, who comes through all this the \\"victor\\": not only does she find a good husband in Edward Weston (the curate whom Rosalie had rejected), but she is obviously head-and-shoulders above the upper-middle class people she works for in morality, decency, self-respect, even common sense.

Agnes Grey, though a pleasant enough book, didn't quite achieve the lofty expectations I had.There was one reviewer in here that said this book appears like something that Jane Austen would have wote - and I agree, with the exception that Austen would have never condescended to write about a mere governess. Jane Austen was more into the Lord and Ladies of British society - the Bronte sisters focused more on the hired help who actually kept that society together.While considerable time was spent going through Agnes's life prior to her marriage, very little time was spent covering the time between hers and Mr. Weston's reunion, and their subsequent marriage. It suggests that either she thinks that the months (or years) passing between two folks (although seperated) is insignificant in the light of their mutual love - or that the authoress is more interested in finishing the book in a hurry.Another paradox I saw was the behavior of the folks who hired Agnes. How can the ruthless, mean, spoiled, self-obsessed, over-indulged (the word &quot;bitchy&quot; comes to mind) people under Agnes' charge ever attract a man for marriage? While Rosalie paid dearly in the end for her earlier transgressions, I don't see her just rewards ever being paid in full.Perhaps it would have been better that Rosalie pining for Mr. Weston, with her hopes and spirit being crused upon notice of Mr. Weston's and Agnes' marriage.There could also have been some better development of the male characters throughout the book. While the men were exclusively in supporting roles, a little more into their minds would have improved the book.Again, I see this as book that was not bad, but not particularly good either. Perhaps, from my earlier reading, my expectations were too high - or, perhaps, the book simply missed the mark."},{"Title":"Agnes Grey (Barnes & Noble Classics Series)","review":"As a fan of the Bronte sisters, I believe that Anne and her writing is most often overlooked. Everyone has read 'Jane Eyre' by Charlotte or 'Wuthering Heights' by Emily, but few have read 'The Tenant of Wildfell Hall' or 'Agnes Grey'. While similar in style to her sisters' writings, Anne's writing has the proclivity to explore the religious side of her characters and their experiences. Her characters find great solace through their faith in God.'Agnes Grey' is the 'diary' of a young governess. Its title character sets out to portray the squalid conditions that governesses worked under - how they were less than servants in the eyes of families whose children could do no wrong; but if they did do wrong, it was the fault of the governess and not the parent. As someone who works with children, it is no surprise that parents do not want to recognize their own fault in their children's misbehavior. Agnes' life is marked with poverty and fear that the only man she loves does not return her feelings.Throughout the novel, the reader is treated to the inner thoughts of the main character, as she pours out her soul (and her numerous tears) onto the page. 'Agnes Grey' is a quick and straight-forward read, with little romanticizing; Bronte's narrator is quick to point out that there are certain things that the reader would not want to read and therefore she has left them out. Overall the book is a telling look at what life must have been like for one of the Bronte sisters - three sisters of a poor curate with few prospects for fortune other than through their writing. Yet the summation is a bit too cursory for a 'tell-all' look at Agnes Grey's life. She says few words, when more are wanted to fully conclude her story."},{"Title":"Agnes Grey (Barnes & Noble Classics Series)","review":"I had hopes for this as I love Charlotte & Emily Bronte's famousnovels but sadly this one is by Ann dreadfully slow and predictable.

The story did not go in-depth enough, but, I kept with it, and found it pleasing enough in the last two-thirds of it. This is the second book I've read of the Bronte sisters, \\"Jane Eyre\\" being the first one (which was amazing and my favorite of all the classics). But this one I will remember fondly, and I am thankful it wasn't any longer, because I may have lost patience with it. The ending is what saved it from a three star vote, when Agnes was able to see some of the comeuppance with her silly students, and become the wife of the man she fancied.

If you liked Jane Eyre, you'll like Agnes Grey."},{"Title":"Agnes Grey (Barnes & Noble Classics Series)","review":"Oh my! What an unforgettable book... It is not only a love story, but a story of a governess. This story is told from the point of view of the nicest, cleverest, humblest, and sometimes funny main character Agnes (One of the best \\"ever after\\" main characters ever!), who becomes a governess to support her family. The first family she lives with is so weird! Read and and see for yourself how mentally wrong that family is, which is sad for their children. Even though it is a hard job, she does not give up and tries to help the children. However, it does not go as she had hoped! Then, she goes to a second family, and falls in love! This is the section that I am so OMG because of the way she describes herself falling in love , and not being able to do anything because of her circumstances and his circumstances! Oh, please read this book if you totally LOVE Jane Austen's Persuasion!"},{"Title":"Agnes Grey (Barnes & Noble Classics Series)","review":"As a novel that follows the plight of a young woman forced into the position of a governess to make ends meet, Anne Bronte's Agnes Grey has of course often been compared with her sister's more famous novel Jane Eyre. And as a love story, it has also been compared with the novels of Jane Austen. It even reminded me a little of the cautionary morality tales that had been popular up to that time, such as Defoe's Moll Flanders.Personally, I enjoyed it more than Pride and Prejudice, but not as much as Jane Eyre. It just doesn't have the same scope and depth. Anne's second novel, The Tenant of Wildfell Hall, on the other hand, does, so I would recommend that over this. That said, this is a nice little novel, and interesting, and sometimes very funny. Well worth reading.And this audio edition narrated by Emilia Fox, who does an excellent job, is very enjoyable to listen to."},{"Title":"Agnes Grey (Barnes & Noble Classics Series)","review":"This all but forgotten little gem is worth remembering. Full of great characters, wise insights and life lessons. Though not as thrilling as Jane Eyre, it is more believable and relatable. It is simply told as well as simply beautiful. I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Agnes Grey (Barnes & Noble Classics Series)","review":"Anne Bront, the neglected sister, deserves to be read by anyone who likes JANE EYRE and WUTHERING HEIGHTS. Actually she reminds me more of Jane Austen than she does of her sisters. This novel lacks the gripping Gothic elements that are so prominent in the major works of Charlotte and Emily, but it does give an excellent picture of real life in the Victorian era.Miss Grey holds the position of governess in two wealthy households, the kind of position that Anne Bront knew very well, since she herself worked as a governess. It is a very awkward position, since the governess may well be the most intelligent person in the place, but she occupies a lower social status and cannot associate on an equal basis with her employers and their well-to-do guests; yet she is not a servant and therefore cannot freely socialize with the maids and cooks. If the children are tractable and if the parents are supportive of her efforts, the governess can feel a sense of accomplishment and pride. However, such an ideal condition does not exist in either of Agnes Grey's pedagogical situations, making her life a constant struggle, which she somehow manages to accept and to persevere with admirable equanimity.The novel provides an insightful picture of social class distinctions, very convincing, if a bit one-sided. Our heroine is a deeply religious, but quite tolerant young lady who grows laudably with her experiences, developing a sure instinct to govern her actions expediently within the narrow confines of her niche in life. A growing love for a kind and conscientious young clergyman tests her emotions greatly, however, especially when she sees one of her beautiful young charges shamelessly attempt to ensnare him just to prove that she can do so. Eventually the plot ends in the desired way, although a bit abruptly.The writing style is very direct and clear. The characters are exceedingly well drawn and consistent throughout. The dialogue is always believable and well worded. I recommend that readers give this younger sister a chance to prove her rightful place as a true and worthy Bront novelist."},{"Title":"Agnes Grey (Barnes & Noble Classics Series)","review":"Agnes Grey could fairly be described as a chick's book. Due to the wonderfully clever syntax and vocabulary of the English,however, my husband also enjoyed it. In this book, we have a buildup to the all-important proposal of marriage. When the moment comes, the lover asks, \\"So you do love me then?\\" and the answer is a simple \\"yes\\" that must have been accompanied by downcast eyes. That moment was anti-climactic, but I thoroughly enjoyed this look at the challenges faced by young educated women in the 19th century. Agnes Grey elects to become a governess at 19 when her father's speculations fail. He becomes ill and his wife and two daughters demonstrate feminine resourcefulness within the confines of what is \\"proper.\\" The two families Agnes works for can only be termed \\"monstrous.\\""},{"Title":"Agnes Grey (Barnes & Noble Classics Series)","review":"No one knew better how trying the life of a governess can be than Anne Bronte. Most of the novel can be considered slightly autobiographical as Anne recounts the many horrors that await the governess arriving to educate the children of a strange family.Like Agnes Grey, Anne Bronte was employed with two families. The first situation she found intolerable. The children were unruly and the parents completely unresponsive to Anne's complaints and concerns. The second family almost drove Anne back to Haworth, but in the end she won the hearts of her pupils.Agnes Grey tells the story of Bronte's experience as a governess. Like Anne Bronte, Agnes is the daughter of a clergyman in the north of England. She is a member of large family, which decreased in size after some siblings died in infancy.Poverty drives Agnes Grey to seek a position as a governess with a family named Bloomfield. The children, however turn out to be a nightmare and their cold hearted mother expects Agnes to perform miracles. Fortunately, Agnes is fired and finds employment with the Murray family.Her new pupils are: Matilda, Rosalie, and John and Charles. Most of the novel focuses on Matilda and Rosalie since John and Charles are sent away. Matilda is somewhat of a tomboy, rough, violent with an unlady-like tendency to swear. Rosalie is beautiful and uses that beauty to her advantage. She aims to marry well and has her sights set on what she considers the perfect husband, who will provide the perfect home.However, Rosalie is quite the little flirt and thinks nothing of making young men fall hopelessly in love with her just for the fun of it. Agnes watches her charge with a disapproving eye but becomes heartbroken when Rosalie's flirtations threaten her own happiness.I found Agnes Grey extremely sweet and well-written. Anne Bronte's gentleness shines through every page. I was anxious to read something written by Anne after reading some Bronte biographies, Agnes Grey was exactly what I expected from such a tender soul as Anne Bronte."},{"Title":"Agnes Grey (Barnes & Noble Classics Series)","review":"I'd been wanting to read this book for several years, and when I finally did, I was not disappointed. Although I found the book somewhat preachy at times (Agnes is the daughter of a clergyman, and the hero is a curate), I still felt that the character of Agnes was compelling. The behavior of the Bloomfield children is disturbing in its mindless cruelty, and Agnes's perseverance in trying to bring about a change is admirable, if only a little bit pathetic. It is obvious that this is a very true to life account of what many governesses went through in Victorian England, being disdained by family and servants alike, having no real place in the household, and being forced to contend with spoiled and unruly children. Readers who have enjoyed Jane Eyre should love this book, and they will find comforting similarities between Agnes and Jane."},{"Title":"Agnes Grey (Barnes & Noble Classics Series)","review":"After reading this, I am now quite surprised that Anne Bronte is the least known of the three Bronte sisters. In my opinion, this short novel is as much a literary superlative as Jane Eyre and very superior to the depressing Wuthering Heights. The fact that Anne wrote this book based on her own experiences made it very believable and made the character of Agnes appear very down to earth. Overall, I would recommend this book because it is not as fluffy as the works of Jane Austen, but not as heavy as Wuthering Heights."},{"Title":"Agnes Grey (Barnes & Noble Classics Series)","review":"Agnes Grey holds the same quality and charm of many a dusty classic. It's a pleasant read, and not too long to bog down the reader. Agnes Grey provides a window into life during Anne Bronte's time, and seems like a combination of the life Anne lived and the life she wanted to live.Agnes Grey is, for the most part, predictable, but pleasantly so. The plot is simple, as are the characters.Any fan of the Bronte family will find this book just what can be imagined coming from sweet Anne. It may be a fascination and love of the story of their family that makes me recommend this book. Or perhaps it's the innocent sweetness of this book."},{"Title":"Agnes Grey (Barnes & Noble Classics Series)","review":"The feeling with which this book is written is absolutely superb. Knowing that in real life Anne's lover died, it's even more painful to read what Agnes says about her marriage, how happy she is.

The words used are enchanting and the story is very true to life. Although it takes place more than a century ago in another country, her descriptions of small children and teenagers are very apt.

This novel truly is simple, unpretentious, and down-to-earth--and, therefore, far too easy to underestimate and undervalue.The title character is the younger daughter of a poor family, who seeks employment as a governess in order to help her parents make ends meet. This noble act of maturity on her part earns her nothing but disillusion, humiliation and hardship in the hands of the tyrannical children and over-indulgent parents of Wellwood House (Note the intriguing initials W.H., which stand for Wuthering Heights and Wildfell Hall in other Bronte books) and, later, Horton Lodge. For several chapters, Anne Bronte does not do much but--dare I say it?--complain about the lot of the Victorian governess. Though her portraits of the children and their parents were obviously drawn from reality, which certainly won sympathy from me, I wanted to tell her to &quot;Get on with the story&quot; many times.The plot does pick up after the artful and exasperating Rosalie Murray has her &quot;coming out&quot; ball. Thoughtless rather than tyrannical, Rosalie has the most well-drawn character of all of Agnes' charges, which makes her such a great foil for Agnes. Rosalie delights in thinking that she could have any man she wishes and enjoys nothing more than toying with men's hearts. When she finds out that Agnes might be in love with the curate, Edward Weston, she makes every attempt to make Mr. Weston fall in love with _her_, thinking that it would be a grand joke to make Agnes miserable. Yet it is impossible to hate her, somehow. She steals every scene she is in; half the story is truly hers.I am happy to say that both Rosalie and Agnes get what they deserve, which is, fittingly, what each explicitly asked and worked for. (Read that any way you wish--or better yet, read the book.) &quot;Agnes Grey&quot; has left me believing that we truly do sow what we reap and receive what we ask for."},{"Title":"Agnes Grey (Barnes & Noble Classics Series)","review":"Anne Bronte constructs a vivid Victorian world in AGNES GREY, which isn't surprising since it's drawn so strongly on her own experiences.Agnes is a dutiful clergyman's daughter who goes into the world to seek employment as a governess in order to contribute to her family's financial well-being. Her several positions are described with deadly accuracy--the bratty children, the yapping dogs, the secretly disdainful other servants, the uninvolved parents. All are rendered here in minute and telling detail.Agnes's familial background--and the familial background of Anne Bronte, of course--makes her especially well-suited to describing a local cleric she dislikes: \\"His favourite subjects were church discipline, rites and ceremonies, apostolical succession, the duty of reverence and obedience to the clergy, the atrocious criminality of dissent, the absolute necessity of observing all the forms of godliness, the reprehensible presumption of individuals who attempted to think for themselves in matters connected with religion, or to be guided by their own interpretations of Scripture, and occasionally (to please his wealthy parishioners), the necessity of deferential obedience from the poor to the rich--supporting his maxims and exhortations throughout with quotations from the Fathers . . . But now and then he gave us a sermon of a different order--what some would call a very good one; but sunless and severe: representing the Deity as a terrible taskmaster, rather than a benevolent father . . . [on leaving the church, I heard] his voice in jocund colloquy with some of the Melthams or Greens, or, perhaps, the Murrays themselves; probably laughing at his own sermon, and hoping that he had given the rascally people something to think about; perchance, exulting in the thought that old Betty Holmes would now lay aside the sinful indulgence of her pipe, which had been her daily solace for upwards of thirty years; the George Higgins would be frightened out of his Sabbath evening walks, and Thomas Jackson would be sorely troubled in his conscience, and shaken in his sure and certain hope of a joyful resurrection at the last day.\\"Bronte displays this same calm, measured, extraordinarily accurate descriptive skill throughout the novel, which more than makes up for the fact that the plot is simple and the action mostly calm and uneventful. The joys of the book lie chiefly in seeing how Bronte renders even the simplest character vividly lifelike."},{"Title":"Agnes Grey (Barnes & Noble Classics Series)","review":"Agnes Grey follows a governess with the same name as she serves in two middle class families. The children are spoiled. Her position is precarious. Through Agnes, Anne Bront explores the position of nineteenth century middle class women.The thing that struck me most about Agnes Grey is how different it is from any of her sisters' books (Emily and Charlotte). While the latter have many romanticized elements, the former is firmly grounded in realism. The families Agnes works for are not romanticized.In fact, there is a subtle critique of Victorian society. The children are monsters and the parents uninvolved. Agnes feels the frustration of her position and the cruelty of her employers.Still she resolves to make her own way, with her own skills and hard work. Agnes does not reach a fuller development like many contemporary heroines. She is held back from developing to her full potential because of the society around her and the precarious economic position she is in.Anne Bront's prose is quiet good, simple and straightforward. It is definitely not overwrought or flowery in any way.Bottom Line: Read Agnes Grey alongside Jane Eyre or Wuthering Heights to see the difference between romantic Emily and Charlotte and realistic Anne Bront. Enjoy the excellent prose too.Read more of my reviews @ trevsliteraryreview.blogspot.com"},{"Title":"Agnes Grey (Barnes & Noble Classics Series)","review":"In the beginning I thought that I wouldn't like this book because of the period in which it was written (Victorian Era).

Three female geniuses sat in the tiny parlor writing away at classics which will live forever. Emily with Wuthering Heights; Charlotte the eldest noted most for Jane Eyre. And then there is Anne....the least well known of the girls. In her short life (1820-1849) she wrote two novels: Agnes Grey and The Tenant of Wildfell Hall which stand up well in the annals of English fiction.Agnes Grey is a short novel of under 200 pages. It tells the story of Agnes Grey the daughter of an impecunious Church of England pastor. Anne leaves the love of her family to become a governess. She works for the horrible Bloomfield family noted for their son's torture of small animals; the bumptiious and repulsive hunting father and the snobbish mother. Disgusted with this family Miss Grey goes to the aristocratic family the Murrays. This is a wealthy family which is self-centered and as cold as a brisk day on the Yorkshire moors. Rosalie and Matilda are the two sisters who are to be taught by Agnes. They are shallow and ignorant girls. Rosalie weds a rich older man to get his estate but is very disappointed in her marriage.Agnes finds happiness with the altruistic and kind clergyman the Rev. Weston.The novel is plainly told with honesty and conviction. The life of a governess caught in the limbo between that of servant and family member is well captured. Women in the 19th century had a dfficult time if they had to support themselves outside of the home.There have many copies of novels about governesses by Anne in Agnes Grey and Charlotte in Jane Eyre are at the top of this type of story.Anne Bronte deserves to be read and appreciated for her literary gifts. She impresses me as a kind Christian woman who loved her family and those less fortunate than she. Her palpable love for animals is also evident.This is a fine novel for anyone wishing to read a good story well told."},{"Title":"Agnes Grey (Barnes & Noble Classics Series)","review":"Agnes Grey is probably the simplest Bronte novel, but in my opinion the best, because it is a sincere story. It is always looked upon as inferior to &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; and &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;, but if reviewed as a story of a governess in the Victorian Era, it is suddenly far more interesting. &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; and &quot;Jane Eyre do not give a realistic view of the times the Brontes lived in, but &quot;Agnes Grey&quot; does and she does not spare us the details.I myself believe that Anne was in love with William Weightman, her fathers curate and seeing that she lets het own heroine Agnes win Mr. Weston, makes me feel that she tries to show us her dream, if she could have had it. It is simple, but happy. And that is exactly what this book is about. It is not to say that love is a never ending passion and all hardships end when one finds THE ONE, but simply to state that joy and wisdom can be found in a happy union.And now, after I have read it many times, I still cry when Agnes tells Mr. Weston that she loves him. That one word &quot;Yes&quot; says it all."},{"Title":"Agnes Grey (Barnes & Noble Classics Series)","review":"Why is this listed as being authored by Jane Austen?

Please correct."},{"Title":"Agnes Grey (Barnes & Noble Classics Series)","review":"Mrs Bront tells the tale of Agnes Grey, a young governess of a little over 20 and her experience working for two families, The Bloomfields and their 3 children Tom, Mary Ann and Fanny, and with the Murrays and their two daughters Mathilda and Rosalie.In writing her first novel, Mrs Bront must have drawn from her own experiences in 1839 when she worked for the Ingham family at Blake Hall and from 1840 till 1845 with the Robinsons at Thorp Green Hall. As her sister Charlotte sated, this personal experience lies behind many of the characters and events as well as Agnes's feelings in the novel.As a first novel, it show an astonishing maturity and technical accomplishment since \\"Agnes Grey\\" is in many ways a very personal story. Mrs Bront describes as vividly as possible the strong pressures that a governess' life involved at that time - the isolation, the frustrations, the insensitive treatment of employers and their families. Actually it transpires in this novel that middle-class households used to consider a governess as little more than a servant thus undervaluing her role as an educator. And the author's view of such households is sharply cynical: they are self-satisfied, vulgar, small-minded snobs who delight in social pretension. They are mercilessly depicted in their moral emptiness and Agnes actually suffers from moral isolation which becomes more and more oppressive and alienating, especially during her stay with the Murrays. In this family Agnes feel deprived from ordinary human kindness and warmth of affection so much so that she falls into depression because she feels that her moral identity is being destroyed, no longer confident in her \\"distinctions of right and wrong\\".A remarkable novel about a young woman and such issues as moral behaviour, moral responsibility and individual integrity."},{"Title":"Agnes Grey (Barnes & Noble Classics Series)","review":"Less dramatic than her own Tenant of Wildfell Hall, and less read than her more famous sisters' works, Agnes Grey is a straightforward, semi-fictional chronicle of the experiences of a governess in 19th century England. Agnes is the younger daughter of a mother whose wealthy family disowned her for loving marrying an impoverished clergyman. To help ameliorate her family's dire financial condition , Agnes chooses to seek a situation as companion and teacher to the children of wealthier people. Though she understands well how to raise responsible children, their selfish parents undermine her attempts by neglecting yet overindulging them. Treated as underling by her employers, ignored by their servants, and plague by her students, poor Agnes must struggle alone under impossible working conditions, determined to help her own family regardless of the cost to herself. Her story comes to a happy conclusion, but Bronte was not interested in writing about \\"felicitous\\" times. Her intention with this book, to reveal some of the injustices of the class system, is achieved by example rather than preaching. Reminiscent of some of Jane Austen's stories, particularly Persuasion, Agnes Grey is a gracefully narrated, unpretentious story told with impressive effect."},{"Title":"Agnes Grey (Barnes & Noble Classics Series)","review":"The book has the elements I look for in a nice story that warms the heart: a faithful heroine, heartless villains, and a happy ending. But the way Anne Bronte has written it takes some of the usual charm out of these elements. This book is filled with religious musings that are meant to edify the reader. They are good thoughts and I agree with them, but they do become quite repetitive. Also, the narrator herself is repetitive. I, however, did enjoy reading this book. It's not as thick a reading as Wuthering Heights or Jane Eyre; think of it as a stepping stone towards those."},{"Title":"Agnes Grey (Barnes & Noble Classics Series)","review":"Is it a love story or is it a story about a governess? A bit of both, in a rather confused way. Agnes is the youngest of two sisters and lives a sheltered and spoiled life as a parson's daughter. She doesn't have to do much more than play with kittens, because she's the baby of the family. She wants to see and do more things in the world than that, and decides to seek a position as a governess. First, she comes to the Bloomfields, an unsympathetic couple whose children are absolutely awful. They're manipulative and nasty creatures who have no respect for anyone and Agnes struggles to keep them in check. Failing, she gets dismissed and is back home.Agnes then goes off again, this time to the Murrays, a bit further afield. The two girls are older and have been brought up better (there are boys as well, but they're sent off to school), so Anne has an easier time with them. The younger girl is a tomboy who likes nothing better than riding and hunting, and the older one is being prepared for making her social d&eacute;but, and likes to flirt with the men of the region.Here Agnes meets with Mr. Weston, the Rector's curate, and she finds herself thinking of him an awful lot, and we gather that he is falling for her as well. Weston is easily ranked high up on the list of cravat-clad crumpets from 19th century fiction! He's incredibly sweet and such a nice guy with his heart in its right place.The thing that struck me about \\"Agnes Grey\\" - I've been struggling not to write \\"Anne\\" in the above text, because this book is so clearly based on the author's own governessing experiences, and she even fell in love with her father's curate - is that while it's a bit wishy-washy plot-wise, it's superb when it comes to characterisation. The characters feel alive. The Bloomfield kids could easily have been on \\"Supernanny\\" because we've all encountered them; psychotic little brats running riot with everyone and their parents not paying attention to them and not believing people when they protest, because their \\"little angels would never do such a thing\\". You know the type? Bront is spot on. It's fascinating to see that it's not a modern problem, but worked exactly the same way in the mid-1800s! The Murrays (the younger one no doubt influenced by Anne's tomboyish sister Emily) are also very alive. Every inch of Rosalie reaks of self-absorbtion. She cares little or nothing about anyone except herself and I found myself half-wishing Agnes would give her a good slap.It's a shame that there's no clear plot in the book. Sure, there's a bit of plot, like her being a governess and showing us all what a nightmare the job can be, but is the plot about her being a governess? As it then goes into a love story, is that the plot? It starts to resemble one, for sure, but it's a bit all over the place. It might be a \\"trenchant expos&eacute;\\" of the governess life, and as such, it's brilliant. As a novel, I would expect a bit more from it. That being said, I rather enjoyed it. She's truly a gifted writer, and I guess this was practice for the book she'd write next (or, while she was writing this one or waiting for it to be published or whatever it was):The Tenant of Wildfell Hall (Oxford World's Classics). Anne wasn't afraid of telling it how it is, and not every story is necessarily one with a happy ending, even if \\"Agnes Grey\\" has one."},{"Title":"Agnes Grey (Barnes & Noble Classics Series)","review":"Not all that interesting, esp if you have read a lot in this genre. This Bronte book is the closest of all the Bronte novels to a Jane Austen type of story. It isn't tragic, it plods along, lots of dialogue.

I must say, she did a better job while writing 'The tenant of wildfell hall.' 'Agnes Grey' is a story of a young girl, who driven by poverty seeks a job as a governess. Being the youngest of a children of two, she has always been protected &amp; sheltered. But when her family loses all their money, she decides to take a post as agoverness. Though ridiculed by her family, she is determined to get a job &amp; at last her family is forced to give in. Unfortunately for her, her employers aren't what she expected them to be. They're rude &amp; unfriendly &amp; the children treat her worse than a servant. But she, being of a strong character, doesn't want to give up &amp; stays on, doing her best, until she is dismissed. After a few happy months with her family, she takes on a post with another family. Though they're no better. It is here that she finds true love,(Mr Weston) but the hero isn't anything like what we read about in books these days. Though her charges try their utmost to prevent Mr Weston from falling in love with her, he does. To cut a long story short, he somehow finds where she lives &amp; proposes to her &amp; they live happily ever after. Somehow, I think this review hasn't come out as planned. The problem is it's too long. Oh, well."},{"Title":"Agnes Grey (Barnes & Noble Classics Series)","review":"The youngest of the three literary Bront sisters, Anne was the first to die, within only two years of the publication of Agnes Grey and one year of the publication of The Tenant of Wildfell Hall. In this edition, Angeline Goreau's introduction offers valuable insights into the relationships among the Bront siblings, Anne's personality without the distortion of Charlotte's lens, and the conditions prevalent in Victorian England that inspired the writing of Agnes Grey.For her first novel, Bront chose to write about the social topic she knew best--life as an underpaid, unempowered, unappreciated governess. Her story, which begins, \\"All true histories contain instruction,\\" closely parallels her own experience as governess to two families of overindulged, undisciplined, disrespectful children. She \\"candidly lay[s] before the public what I would not disclose to the most intimate friend.\\"At times, Agnes Grey is hard to read, not because of the Victorian language and conventions, but because Bront's unadorned, dispassionate writing style coolly conveys the monstrosity and heartlessness of the children for whom she has responsibility without power and of their distantly doting parents. When the cruel, sadistic Tom Bloomfield, age 7, tries to torture and kill a nest of baby birds and Agnes intervenes, spoiling his \\"fun,\\" his mother coldly tells her, \\"You seem to have forgotten that the creatures were all created for our convenience . . . I think a child's amusement is scarcely to be weighed against the welfare of a soulless brute.\\" Through her portrayal of Tom, Bront makes it clear who in her opinion is the \\"soulless brute\\" and how he came to become one. Meanwhile, Tom, his sister Mary Ann, and their parents foil Agnes's every attempt to perform her duties, including the teaching of morals.Agnes's next family, the Murrays, are somewhat tolerable by comparison, although she is expected to, in her words, \\"study and strive to amuse and oblige, instruct, refine, and polish, with the least possible exertion on their part, and no exercise of authority on mine.\\" In the Murray household, Agnes is subjected to a form of social snobbery and disdain from which her background, manners, and education do not exempt her. All that matters to the wealthy and privileged Murrays is that she is the hired help, to be controlled, ignored, bullied, or snubbed at their whim.Agnes becomes a governess against her family's wishes so that she can help them out of their financial straits. When her illusions about molding the minds, hearts, and souls of her charges are taught away in chapters titled, \\"First Lessons in the Art of Instruction\\" and \\"A Few More Lessons,\\" Agnes does not continue her ignominious career out of economic necessity; in fact, her family refuses to accept her financial assistance. She continues to work from a sense of pride; she does not want to admit to her family, and perhaps to herself, the personal and emotional cost of her own \\"instruction.\\"Given Bront's purpose in writing Agnes Grey, there are some difficulties with the novel. First, Agnes's distress is primarily emotional, yet surely the masses of underpaid governesses suffered from poverty and from the hopelessness of escaping it. As Goreau notes, there were so many single women vying for governess positions that the employers could pay these vulnerable women next to nothing in wages, even taking deductions for laundry. Charlotte Bront herself was paid 20 pounds per year at her final post, with 4 pounds deducted for washing. This deprivation, and the lifelong sense of despair that must have come with it, is not evident in Agnes Grey.The novel also becomes sidetracked from its purpose when Agnes develops an interest in the new curate, Edward Weston. Toward the end, Agnes Grey is transformed from a novel about governesses and Victorian family life into a weak, undramatic love story that is too drawn out. The Anne Bront who hid her feelings from the domineering Charlotte does not reveal them even through Agnes. While Charlotte's Jane Eyre and Emily's Wuthering Heights seethe with the drama and passion of unhealthy relationships, Agnes Grey plods through the development of an uninspired one.The strength of Agnes Grey lies in its characterizations of Victorian country society and the people who inhabit it. Their materialism, which reaches its apex here in the unhappily married Rosalie Murray; their wanton wastefulness; their view of nature as subservient to the whims of man; and their hypocrisy and recasting of God into man's image are the easily recognized precursors to many 20th-century attitudes. Despite its faults and facile ending, Agnes Grey is a tiny but honest glimpse into the Victorian world that preceded ours. Angelina Goreau's informative introduction, with its generous helping of quotations, makes this edition especially worthwhile."},{"Title":"Agnes Grey (Barnes & Noble Classics Series)","review":"A pretty little Victorian novel by Anne Bronte. Not nearly as good as \`The Tenant of Wildfell Hall' but still charming and fun. The portrait of Agnes as an innocent but good and charitable governess is well drawn. However her \`goodness' gets a bit tiring toward the end. You begin wishing she would stand up for herself, but I guess that wouldn't be acceptable Victorian behaviour. Of course as a governess she meets tyrannical children, stupid egoistic employers, silly gentry, but she also describes the peasants of the time and compares \`good' and \`vain' preachers. In the end goodness is rewarded and greed is taught a nice lesson. Worth reading if only to compare to \`The Tenant' and better known works by the other Bronte sisters."},{"Title":"Agnes Grey (Barnes & Noble Classics Series)","review":"As much as I love Tenant of Wildfell Hall I can't say that I loved this work as much. If anything it does give the reader a good insight to the miserable life governess endured. However, if the coachman was to write a book, or day labour of those times were to write a book, I can't imagine that their lot in life was much fairer. So the complaint is the same complaint that holds true today: rich people have it so easy. But of course upon closer inspection, the grass isn't always greener on the other side. Rosalie learns this lesson well. Though the book picks up after Rosalie's \\"coming out\\", the story I'm most interested in, Agnes and Edward feel more like a rush job within the last seven pages of the novel. I wanted to know about them than whole chapters of a sermon from a temporarily blind person. In all, I feel this a very padded story, since Agnes doesn't really go through an metamorphis and she requires the man of her heart with no effort at all and any chancy spirited adventures. Overall: Wildfell will remain my favorite from this author."},{"Title":"Agnes Grey (Barnes & Noble Classics Series)","review":"This was a simple, albeit enjoyable tale of Agnes Grey, a younger daughter who seeks her way in the world employed as a governess. I understand this tale is based upon Ms. Bronte's own experiences and brings to light the snobbery of the upper class along with the often degrading way that the servants are treated by the same.The first family literally has the children from h***, the second family being not quite as abusive, but still treat the servants as second class people. The young Misses Murray are self centered and thoughtless, particularly the elder (who gets what she deserves in the end).I have been reading a book called the Selected Works of the Bronte sisters, and it's been interesting to compare the sisters' writing styles.

I love the heroine, love it that the book is a realistic portrayal of human nature. You know the writer has done a good job when you get angry at a novel's antagonists. And I did.The story that unfolds is this: A minister who married a wealthy nobleman's daughter strives to give her a modicum of the monetary security she gave up for him, but loses their entire savings in an investment. His youngest daughter decides to help the family out by becoming a governess to two different families. Each experience teaches her lessons and serves to confirm that her Christian values are the wisest values to live by. I will not give away the ending, but I will say the take-away lesson is that you reap what you sow.Anne Bronte is a descriptive writer without going over the top with it. You get a sense of the reality of what's going on without getting bogged down by the mundane. If you think her work is too descriptive, maybe a comic book will suit you better than a novel. ;)As a Christian, I am fascinated with the descriptions of the clergy in the Regency era, especially from the viewpoints of clergymen's children. It seems there were two types of clergymen: true believers or those for whom it was just a job. This novel provides a really stark contrast between the two, even better than Jane Austen's in Mansfield Park."},{"Title":"Agnes Grey (Barnes & Noble Classics Series)","review":"I loves this book.

Although this volume aims to develop and give a name to a budding field of inquiry, the chapters in Part I are devoted to researchers who have been working in this area all along.Chapter 2, by Herb Clark and Adrian Bangerter, provides both a historical and a contemporary perspective on reference, which is the ubiquitous activity involved in picking out an object for an addressee. Consider the utterance Put the small coffee cup over there. One would have to pick out the cup (presumably from among other candidate objects) and know where over there is (presumably from a gesture). Their chapter describes how reference was initially viewed as autonomous and addressee-blind before it came to be viewed as an activity that requires the coordination of both speaker and addressee. Among the features of referring highlighted are: (a) the multiple methods of directing an addressee's attention to individual objects; and (b) speaker-addressee pacts to arrive at a reference (i.e., to agree to certain provisional names). The coordination involved in referring is extensive, Clark and Bangerter argue, leading them to conclude that it is far from being an autonomous act. In fact, it requires more than mere coordination, it is an act that requires the full participation of both initiator and addressee. The chapter highlights how armchair reflection, field observations and careful experimentation have combined to lead to a more profound understanding of this fundamental communicative act. The chapter also provides an opportunity to appreciate Clark's well-known contributions to discourse analysis (the Given-New contract, common ground) in the context of pragmatic theory-making.For more than 20 years, Raymond W. Gibbs, Jr., has embodied the aim of this book, by specifically testing linguistic-pragmatic theories using experimental psychological methods. In Chapter 3, Gibbs describes how his experiments have constrained theories with respect to four areas that are at the heart of linguistic-pragmatics: making and understanding promises, under-standing definite descriptions, making and interpreting indirect speech acts, and the distinction between what is said and what is meant. In each case, he has - like most accomplished experimentalists - come up with one or more clever designs that, in the end, either elucidate a given theory (e.g., the short-circuited nature of indirect requests) or force one to rethink a theory's claims (e.g., Searle's speech act theory with respect to promises). The aim of Gibbs's chapter is to convince experimentalists of the value of linguistic-pragmatic theories and to convince linguists of the value of experimentation.Metaphor is a classic pragmatic form whose understanding has been greatly advanced by psycholinguistic investigations. As Sam Glucksberg shows in Chapter 4, metaphor comprehension in psycholinguistics was initially viewed through a Gricean lens, in which the literal interpretation of a metaphor is given priority. According to Grice (or Searle), a metaphor renders an utterance 'defective' and prompts one to look for another meaning. In his chapter, Glucksberg argues that this standard pragmatic model persisted in the literature because its literal-first hypothesis resonates with an approachthat assumes that both semantics and syntax are primary while pragmatics is secondary, an assumption that is common in psycholinguistic circles. Through his and his colleagues' pioneering work on metaphor, Glucksberg demonstrates how metaphorical interpretations of sentences such as Some jobs are jails are carried out as automatically as other linguistic processes. He extends his analysis to other related phenomena (e.g., showing how novel features emerge in conceptual combinations like peeled apples) in order to show just how automatic pragmatic processes are in comprehension tasks. He concludes by suggesting that experimentation is needed to determine the correct division of labour between linguistic decoding and pragmatic inferencing, a central issue in current pragmatic theory. The pragmatic process, as shown by Sam Glucksberg, does not merit its 'stepchild' status; pragmatics is so automatic that it is arguably a module. In Chapter 5, Guy Politzer - who was often a lone voice underlining the importance of linguistic-pragmatics to the field of reasoning - provides a pragmatic analysis of both classic and modern reasoning tasks along with experimental results that stress the importance of the way individual premises, conclusions and task information in general are interpreted. For a notable example, consider Piaget's famous class-inclusion problem, in which children are shown a picture of five daisies and three tulips and then asked, 'Are there more daisies or more flowers?' After presenting a 'microanalysis' of the way the task's demands are interpreted, Politzer shows that young children (5-year-olds) fail to answer correctly (to say flowers) because they interpret 'flowers' to mean flowers-that-are-not-daisies. He also shows how a short series of disambiguating questions prompts even the youngest children to demonstrate their class-inclusion skills. Such microanalyses can be applied equally to many of Kahneman and Tversky's tasks (e.g., the Linda problem and the Engineer-Lawyer problem), Wason's tasks (the 2-4-6 problem and the Selection Task), as well as to individual terms like conditionals and quantifiers. The implications for this approach are clear: one cannot do reasoning work without linguistic-pragmatics.Chapter 6 by Tony Sanford and Linda Moxey reviews their previous work on the psychological processing of quantifier understanding and demonstrates how experimental approaches can inform linguistic-pragmatics. They begin by pointing out that not all quantifiers are alike. A large set of 'non-standard' quantifiers, such as few, many and most, convey much more than a rough notion of quantity or proportions; they have communicative functions as well. For example, polarity plays a determinative role in quantifier interpretation. A negative quantifier like few and a positive quantifier like a few have quite different effects on the interpretation of sentences. Compare few versus a few of the MPs attended the meeting. Few is more likely than A few to place the focus on the complementary set, those MPs who did not show up. Their findings show that the interpretation of quantifiers goes well beyond the semantics of these terms.Current issues in experimental pragmaticsThe chapters in this section extend both the range of topics one can investigate in Experimental Pragmatics and the techniques one can use. The chapters here cover inter alia disambiguation, metaphor and joke comprehension, promise understanding, the import of saying even-if, and the telling of time. All these topics are addressed using various experimental paradigms from neuropsychology, developmental psychology, reasoning, psycholinguistics and anthropology.In Chapter 7, Jean-Baptiste Van der Henst and Dan Sperber review experiments that test central tenets of Relevance Theory and in particular the cognitive principle of relevance ('human cognition is geared to the maximization of relevance'), and the communicative principle ('every utterance conveys a presumption of its own relevance'). Some of these experiments draw on two standard paradigms in the psychology of reasoning: relational reasoning and the Wason Selection Task. Others investigate the behaviour of people asked the time by a stranger in public places. All involve manipulating separately the two factors of relevance, effect and effort. These experiments illustrate how a pragmatic theory that is precise enough to have testable consequences can put previous experimental research in a novel perspective and can suggest new experimental paradigms.Orna Peleg, Rachel Giora and Ofer Fein give an account of the role of the context in accessing the appropriate meaning of ambiguous terms in sentence comprehension in Chapter 8. They argue against: (a) a modular view which assumes that lexical access to all meanings of a word are automatic and encapsulated only to be refined by an independent non-modular system; and against (b) a direct access view which relies largely on just the context to arrive at a word's intended meaning. Rather, they propose the graded salience hypothesis, which assumes that: (a) more salient meanings are accessed faster from the start; and that (b) context also affects comprehension on-line. Their chapter presents four experiments whose results lend strong support to their claims.In Chapter 9, Seana Coulson provides a review of the way Evoked Response Potentials' (ERP) methods can be applied to language comprehension, with a focus on what this technique has to offer pragmatics. The chapter is instructive in that it describes ERP's various dependent variables (P300, N400, P600 etc.) and the aspects of comprehension with which these measures are associated. Coulson cites studies of pragmatic import - for example, on joke comprehension and metaphor integration - including many that come from Coulson herself. She works from a model that predicts that processing difficulty is related to the extent to which comprehension requires the participant to align and integrate conceptual structure across domains. She goes on to suggest ways in which ERP experiments could be exploited to investigate other linguistic-pragmatic issues, such as prosody and thedistinction between explicatures and implicatures. Overall, her chapter shows very clearly how imaging can be exploited and indicates what one should expect from this technique in the future.In Chapter 10, Josie Bernicot and Virginie Laval focus on children between the ages of 3 and 10 and their developing understanding of promises, based on the theoretical framework of Speech Act Theory (Austin 1962; Searle, 1969, 1979; Searle and Vanderveken, 1985). The authors summarize a programme of research that has been investigating promise comprehension among children from the point of view that language is a communication system and that language competence is the acquisition and use of that system. What counts as a promise? Here the authors present two experiments investigating the extent to which interlocutors' intentions (listener's wishes about the accomplishment of an action) and textual characteristics of utterances (verb tense) play a role in understanding that a promise was made.In Chapter 11, Simon J. Handley and Aidan Feeney develop a psycho-logical account of the way in which people reason with even-if, working in a mental models' framework (Johnson-Laird, 1983). According to the mental model approach, many errors of reasoning arise because people represent only one or a few of all the models of a given set of premises and leave the other models implicit. They then draw their conclusions on the sole basis of the explicitly represented models. Handley and Feeney compare two possible ways in which this partial representation of problems might arise. In one, all models are represented before being pared down by extra-logical, namely pragmatic, factors; in the other, which the authors advocate, initial representations are limited to one model while pragmatic considerations add new models. They present two experiments based on inference making from even-if premises that lend support to their account. They discuss the implications of their work for experimental pragmatics in general.The case of scalar implicaturesThe chapters in the third section of the book focus on one pragmatic phenomenon, scalar implicature, which is at the heart of ongoing debates in pragmatic theory. As described earlier, there are two main accounts of these inferences. One assumes that such implicatures are automatically associated with the use of a weak term (as exemplified by Levinson, 2000) and the other assumes that the implicature is drawn out effortfully (as exemplified by Relevance Theory). In these chapters, four authors (or groups of authors) present experimental findings that lend support either to Relevance Theory or to some form of the default view.In Chapter 12, Anne Bezuidenhout and Robin Morris first describe how they operationalized the two theoretical accounts into testable pragmatic-processing models. This is less obvious than it might seem because it is hard to do justice to the rich and detailed accounts that have been offered by these rival theories on the topic of scalar implicatures. They then report on two eye-movement experiments that test predictions generated from the models as participants read a series of sentence-pairs such as Some books had colour pictures. In fact all of them did, which is why the teachers liked them. One can determine whether Some in the first sentence readily prompts Not all by investigating potential slowdowns and look-backs when processing the second sentence. They argue that the weight of the evidence favours the Underspecification Account (which is the one inspired by Relevance Theory); however, they argue that their Default Model (the one inspired by a neo-Gricean account) could be modified to accommodate their results.In Chapter 13, Gennaro Chierchia, Maria Theresa Guasti, Andrea Gualmini, Luisa Meroni, Stephen Crain and Francesca Foppolo present a novel account of implicatures based on the Semantic Core Model, which challenges a way of interpreting Grice's proposal that has become dominant in the field. According to the dominant view, one first retrieves the semantics of a whole root sentence and then processes the implicatures associated with it (in a strictly modular way). The Semantic Core Model proposes, instead, that semantic and pragmatic processing take place in tandem. Implicatures are factored in recursively, in parallel with truth conditions. They go on to present experimental evidence from adults and children that support this new model. One of the novel findings from this work demonstrates how particular grammatical contexts predict the non-existence of scalar implicatures.In Chapter 14, Ira A. Noveck reviews the two rival accounts and the processing predictions they engender, before summarizing his laboratory's findings from experiments investigating those logical terms (i.e., might, some, or and and) that could be interpreted either minimally (i.e., with just their linguistically encoded meanings) or as pragmatically enriched. His developmental studies show how children are less likely than adults to pursue pragmatic inferences, leading to a robust experimental effect in which children actually appear more logical than adults. Follow-ups show how task-demands, and not just age, can affect the production of pragmatic inference making, pointing to the important role of context in these paradigms. The adult studies, which include an ERP investigation, primarily explore the time-course of scalar inferences. Whereas participants' pragmatic treatments of underinformative statements (e.g., the time taken to respond False to Some cows are mammals) are very time consuming, True responses are not. Furthermore, time pressure encourages True responses. Noveck presents his findings as support for Relevance Theory.In Chapter 15, Anne Reboul presents a novel task, which she calls Koenig's puzzle, as promising ground for testing between the two rival theories. Imagine that after being handed a glass of wine, a speaker says Better red wine than no white wine. The puzzle consists in determining the speaker's wine preference and inferring what she was actually given. While referring to the two sides of the debate as localists and globalists (for the Default and Relevance accounts, respectively), Reboul describes Koenig's puzzle in detail and proposes a solution to it. Reboul then explains why such sentences may be used to test between the two accounts. Finally, her paper reports two experiments whose results show how implicatures are actually involved in the puzzle. Her results are presented as support for global over local theories for this specific pragmatic phenomenon.How to approach the bookThe chapters are representative of what we are calling Experimental Pragmatics. Each summarizes previous experimental work or presents original experiments that address topics central to pragmatic theory - metaphor, quantifier interpretation, scalar inference, disambiguation, reference and promise understanding, to name a few. Many of the chapters share common themes, especially the last four, but each can be read and appreciated separately. Our intention has been to illustrate how Experimental Pragmatics may contribute to linguistics and psychology, and to the cognitive sciences in general."},{"Title":"The Encyclopedia of Group Activities, Loose-Leaf Package: 150 Practical Designs for Successful Facilitating","review":"This book is a treasure trove of activities suitable for many types of group.

Some activities could easily be used in any group type; others are specifically suited to work situations or personal growth groups. Large and small group activities are included.If you are a leader seeking icebreakers for new groups, this would not be your ideal book, although some activities could be adapted to serve as icebreakers.Overall this book is thorough, well organized, and well worth the investment as a source of activities and ideas."},{"Title":"Plagues & Poxes","review":"got this for a history of medicine course i took in my senior year of college. it actually is pretty gnarly if you get into it. i usually dread reading textbooks; this is one of those exceptions. basically, if yr taking a history course & yr teacher assigns you this, consider yrself lucky."},{"Title":"Plagues & Poxes","review":"The \\"M.D.\\" stands prominently after the author's name on the cover of this book and that's probably for a good reason: this text would fit better in the pages of a medical journal then as a book for public consumption. As a reader with a science background (albeit in physics) I am always ready to read a new science book. I also have an interest in the study of disease, particularly as it relates to the historical development of the human race. Still, this book was a disappointment.Consider the following passage from the chapter on anthrax: \\"Most naturally occurring anthrax strains are sensitive to penicillin, which historically has been the preferred anthrax therapy. Doxycycline is the preferred option among the tetracycline class of agents, because it has been proved efficacious in monkey studies. Other members of this class of antibiotics are suitable, and animal studies suggest that such prophylaxis should be effective. The floroquinolone antibiotics (such as ciprofloxacin [Cipro])should have equivalent efficacy, but no data are available...\\" Not only is this dull prose, it is unimportant to the thread of the story that Dr. Bollett claims he is telling. And this is only one of the most prominent examples of poor prose (besides making me wonder whether or not Dr. Bollett has any financial interest in Cipro).According to the introduction, this book is a revised edition to an earlier book on the same subject. I didn't read the first edition but I have a feeling it is much better than this book. Mainly because the last three chapters on emerging diseases are the poorest in the book and are probably new to this addition. As are what I expect are new paragraphs near the end of every chapter that relates how every single disease in history could be weaponized. It is disturbing to see a book like this play on people's fears of bioterrorism.It's unfortunate because the historical sections of the book which are the bulk of the first parts of each chapter are well done if a bit dry. Dr. Bollett has turned the traditional view around a bit by considering how human history has impacted epidemic disease rather than the other way around. If the book had stayed on this path it would have been decent, if not great. Somehow this new edition has lost its way."},{"Title":"Plagues & Poxes","review":"The impact of human history on epidemic disease is related in Dr. Bollett's Plagues And Poxes, an excellent medical-based survey which charts the rise and changing of disease patterns throughout human history.

Rene Grousset was one of those rare writers who could infect the reader with the same enthusiasm and interest that he himself possessed. Naomi Walford did a fantastic job translating from the original French text and retaining the spirit of the work. The 600+ pages cover in chronological order the history of steppe tribes from the Scythians to the Dzungar realm in the late 18th century. Throughout the work Grousset conveys to the reader a detailed picture of the various Turkic, Mongol, and Manchu tribes (and to a lesser extent Indo-Eurpoean tribes), and how political and military control of the steppe regions shifted between these tribes over the centuries. There is also a great deal of coverage on the more well-known known conquerors (Genghis and Kublai Khan, Tamerlane) and their empires. The book contains a great number of quotes from passages recorded by many civilizations throughout history which had come in contact with these Central Asian peoples, and these coupled with Grousset's writing style portray the events and personalities of that distant age in a more intimate light. The fact that Indo-Europeans had co-existed in close proximity to Turkic-Mongol tribes and Chinese peoples long before recorded history was a fascinating revelation to me. In addition to documenting the geographic parameters of the more significant empires and their direct contact with cultures from Poland to Iraq to India to Japan, Grousset also shows how events in Central Asia have indirectly affected distant regions by causing a chain of population displacements that resulted in military conquests far away from Central Asia. Although Grousset often resorted to speculations which have proved in time to be inaccurate, the detraction from the book's overall quality is minimal. One can read one of the many up-to-date books on this subject to clean up Grousset's inaccuracies, but I personally have yet to find one that has been of comparable pleasure to read."},{"Title":"The Empire of the Steppes A History of Central Asia","review":"A work of historical research is certainly a well-respected classic when it is used as a primary reference in just about every subsequent book on the subject. Rene Grousset's history is truly monumental, covering the vast steppe region from Korea to Hungary, and over the course of around 1500 years, and incorporates several different realms of knowledge that each would require a lifetime of work by most historians. Of course this book offers in-depth coverage of the famous conquerors of the era, such as Attila and Tamerlane, and obviously Jenghiz (Genghis) Khan and his many descendents, but there is also rewarding coverage of many more intriguing (if often bloodthirsty and genocidal) leaders and a great many enigmatic ethnic groups. Note that this book is an especially difficult read, as Grousset's prose often operates in the form of lists, crushed by voluminous references to obscure tribes and individuals, not to mention a continuous parade of geographic locations under names that usually are no longer current. A historical atlas, or several of them, would be of great assistance while you read, while this book would benefit immensely from many, many more maps. Meanwhile, the sheer vastness of the regions and periods covered by Grousset made it structurally impossible for him to cover his subjects in chronological order.You often despair that it would help to have multiple PhD's in ancient history in order to be able to truly understand this immense tome. But in the end, all of the imposing detail remains truly fascinating, and Grousset offers much food for thought in his underlying themes of human geography. We ultimately learn about the how the geographical and physical characteristics of the steppe environment ensured the emergence of brutal but glorious nomads, who always had a very complex relationship with the settled cultures they were continually conquering. But eventually, the conquerors became the conquered, as the rewards of sedentary civilization brought a slow end to nomadic conquest. Grousset's work is a classic of both minute historical detail and vast human themes.

This is more than a history of Central Asia -- it is a whole treatise on the impact of the nomads on the sedentary peoples. The book also places a heavy emphasis on the origins of various peoples (Turks, Mongols, etc.) and their relationships. The displacement of the Indo-Europeans by the Turks in Central Asia (from western China to present-day Uzbekistan) also makes for facsinating reading. There is also detailed discussions about Genghis Khan and the Mongols -- frankly much better than most other books I've read that deal with only that topic.On the negative side, the book focuses too much on Genghis Khan and generally has a pro-Mongol bias. Some of the maps are also quite unhelpful and do not correspond to the text too well.Nonetheless, this old book is still the best around after all these years."},{"Title":"The Empire of the Steppes A History of Central Asia","review":"This book is truly a &quot;work of historical art&quot;.

His opinion is you can't understand European history without understanding the history of the steppes. My opinion is that you can't understand the history of China without understanding the Steppes. This book covers both sides admiringly well despite its date (1939). From the time of dim prehistory to the last struggle of the once-great descendants of the Ghengis Khanate, Grousset described the greatest and mostly unknown saga of the peoples of the steppe. We find out the history of the Indo-European cultures in central Asia (Yes, this was decades before the discovery of the blonde mummies in China and Grousset could have predicted their discovery decades ago). We find out about the Kara-Kitai, the greatest enemy the Muslims of Asia ever faced (NOt the Crusaders). We were there when the Dzungars, last heir of Ghengis Khan was caught between the expanding Russian empire and the rising Manchu empire.

Inner or Central Asia, the land of the Steppe peoples has produced countless massive migrations of peoples and an ehtnic and linguistic patchwork stretching from China to Turkey and beyond. An area that comprises Muslims and Buddhists, that was home to the Huns, Genghis Kahn and the Turks, it is fascinating history of a part of the world that few realize is important.The Huns appeared in Europe in the 2nd century CE. Alexander the Great was in the area in the 5th century BCE. The land of the steppes, stretching from Mongolia to central asia, through tot he Caucuses is an immense land. Conquered by Genghis Kahn, it was ruled by the ancestors of these hordes for hundreds of years. The hordes disintegrated leaving remnants as distant as India. However we see also the Turkic influence on the languages not only of the Xuiguers of China's Xinxiang province but also in the Azeria, Uzbeks and Kazahks.The Steppes provided a land for Buddhism and Islam as both religions spread through it. Yet we also see Marco Polos journey. This is history on a grand scale, told throuhg conjecture, and eye witness account. it explains culture and vast military conquest, as well as linguistic and archeological evidence. In short this is THE text for the region. It explains the impact on the civilizations of the Persians, Islam and Europe as well as China, Russia and Japan. In Short the heart of the world is the steppe peoples and the regions once ability to produce massive waves of barbarian migrations led not only to the collapse of the Roman empire, but the ethnic and linguistic changes that causes Germany to speak German and the Muslim Ummayid empire to collapse. The horsemen of central asia figured in Tamerlane and Alexanders worlds. They also lived on in their special cultural societies into modern times. This is history at its broadest and best.Seth J.

It encompasses the vast space East of Europe, West of China and North of the Black Sea, Persia and India. Most historians dismiss it simply as a trackless wasteland, beyond the pale of civilization, from which waves of bloodthirsty barbarians periodically emerged to trouble the civilized people of the world. It was the origin of the innumerable varieties of Scythians, Huns, Turks, Mongols and Tatars who have plagued civilization for millenia. The regions' inhabitants were the people whom the Greeks thought were Centaurs because they were able to shoot arrows from horseback and seemingly never got off their horses, the Huns who nearly toppled the Roman empire, the people against whom the Chinese built the worlds largest longest wall to keep them out, and whom the Medieval Europeans characterized as \\"The Scourge of God\\". It is the region that spawned Atilla the Hun, Genghis Khan, the Ilkhans of Persia, The Golden Horde, Tamerlane, The Mogul Empire of India, the Seljuk and Ottoman Empires of Turkey, and the Yuan and Manchu Dynasties of China.Rene Grousset is among the very few historians to have taken the region known as Central Asia, and it's people, seriously. Although written some years ago his monumental work, \\"The Empire of the Steppes\\", remains THE fundamental work on the region of Central Asia, it's bewildering variety of peoples, and it's complex history. This is admittedly not an easy book to go though. This was a region of nomads, where the various peoples moved around a great deal, and there is no question that the book could have used more and better maps to help keep matters straight. Nevertheless, this book covers the history of the entire region of Central Asia, and it's diverse peoples, from neolithic times down to the rise of Manchu China, and that covers an awful lot of ground.

Here is an example of what I mean in the first paragraph of the first chapter:\\"The first known Eurasian route is that of the northern steppes. By this trail, in paleolithic times, the Aurignacian culture spread through Siberia--an \\"Aurignacian Venus\\" has been found at Malta, not far from Irkutsk, on the upper Angara River--and thence into northern China, where Teilhard de Chardin notes the presence of Aurignacian-type hearths buried in the loess at Kweitung, near Ningsia in Kasue, and at the Siara-osso-gol, southwest of Yulin in the northern region of Shensi. Similarly, the Magdalenian culture seems to be represented in Siberia (on the upper Yenisei) and in Manchuria (at Dolonnor [Tolun], Manchouli, and Khailar), and in Hopei. Here in the upper cave of Chowkowtien....\\" ad nauseum.No discussion of what \\"Aurignacian\\" culture IS. No map reference (i.e. See Figure 1). Even in terms of a dissertation or thesis, this is awful.Especially when I compare this with Jack Weatherford's wonderful book Genghis Khan, which gives a brilliant overview and understanding of the impact of Genghis Khan, which has been distorted throughout history.I developed a fascination for Mongolian history lately, but this book--does nothing to scratch that itch.

The battle between state's rights and federal authority is ongoing. Although the general trend is an increasing level of national supremacy, neither the state, nor the federal government has yet or will possess the power to secure a monopoly of control. I found most interesting the impact of the Supreme Court and the Progressive Era on changes in American federalism.In discussing the Supreme Court, it is necessary to point out that its impact has ebbed and flowed in regards to state's rights and federal authority. For example, under the Warren court, decisions were passed down which limited the right of individual states to govern their own affairs in a sovereign manner. The author cites a number of court decisions as illustrations of the imposition of federal will over state self-governance. Two famous cases are Miranda v. Arizona and Brown v. Board of Education. In both cases, the Court imposed a national will upon the decisions of the state.As stated above, the impact of the Supreme Court on federalism does not flow in one direction. Under the late William Rehnquist, the Supreme Court began to hand down decisions that placed a greater influence on the rights of states to govern their own affairs without the pressure of federal authority. Two important cases illustrating the general feeling towards federalism by the Rehnquist court are Brown v. Thomson, which dealt with state apportionment plans, and San Antonio v. Rodriguez, which dealt with equality between schools. In both cases, the Court found in favor of the states handling their own affairs without the influence of federal authority.A second impact on the fluid nature of American federalism was the Progressive Era. Derthick writes, \\"The Progressive Era advanced a new way of thinking about federalism, grounded less in constitutional law than in conceptions of community and political ideology\\" (106). I found this interesting due to the attack on the Constitution. Rather than adhere to a literal reading of the Constitution, Progressives argued for interpretation of the words of the founding fathers. The Constitution held that the United States was \\"an indestructible Union composed, of indestructible States\\" (106).The Progressives, however, attempted to create a national community rather than one separated by state boarders. In order to do so, the Progressives launched a movement which offered a new interpretation of the Constitution, rather than a strict reading. This interpretation focused on the importance of a national consensus. The good of the nation, should surpass the individual desires of those in a particular state. J. Allen Smith, quoted in Derthick writes, \\"A constitution can not be regarded as a check upon the people themselves...(but) the means of securing the supremacy of public opinion and not an instrument of thwarting it...(the Constitution) must yield readily to changes in public opinion\\" (108).Although the Supreme Court and the Progressive Era are not the only sculptors of American federalism, their impact cannot be ignored. The interactions between the two, and among each's subsequent part, the fluidity and malleability of the American federal system becomes apparent."},{"Title":"Crying: A Natural and Cultural History of Tears","review":"In this book, the author puts his multi-disciplinary knowledge to good use by summarizing literary, artistic, cultural, biological, and psychological analyses of tears. Lutz synthesizes these viewpoints in clear language, accompanied by vivid pictures and illustrations that further clarify his points. With examples ranging from Alice in Wonderland to Freud's rejection of crying as catharsis, the book covers a remarkable amount of material across a great deal of time, while remaining a cohesive text.Those interested in psychology will appreciate Lutz's analysis of the varied psychological explanations of crying, as well as his perspective on Phineas Gage. Students of anatomy will be impressed by his clear explanation of the lacrimal system and the history of how it came to be understood. Sociologists and anthropologists will be fascinated by his insights into cultural mourning. And fans of literature will enjoy his analysis of tears in fiction, in which he discusses playwrights from Shakespeare to Neal Simon and authors from Socrates to Dostoyevsky. The book even treats crying in relation to films such as Lorenzo's Oil and Titanic!In effect, although classified as a psychology book, &quot;Crying&quot; has a little something for most everyone. A useful book for analysis, self-reflection, reference or study."},{"Title":"Crying: A Natural and Cultural History of Tears","review":"\\"Tears have been central to myth, religion, poetry, and fiction through the ages, but until recently, remarkably little has been written in an attempt to explain and understand tears themselves. Perhaps no other fundamental human activity has received so little direct and sustained attention.\\" ~ Tom LutzTom Lutz presents an understanding of tears to explore crying as expressed in cultural context. He explains the reasons why people don't weep at funerals in Bali, reveals the chemical content of emotional versus lubricating tears, and delves into tribal rituals that seek to wash away psychic pain.\\"Crying: The Natural & Cultural History of Tears\\" looks at tears from every angle an anthropologist could wish for and while Tom Lutz uncovers the mystery and intrigue of tears, he also appeals to the psychologist in us all who longs for deeper explanations. This can at times read more like an intellectual treatise rather than an emotive argument, but all the while, Tom Lutz seems to seek a validation for crying in a world where no one can agree on a similar standard for the shedding of tears. Some cultures have specific rules for when you may or may not cry that seem shockingly cruel on the surface, but reveal an underlying need for survival in difficult circumstances. The harmful mourning rituals of some tribes made horror movies sound like a summer picnic.The spiritual significance of tears is especially interesting, as is the way humans express their feelings of loss. As Tom Lutz so aptly states: \\"...without desire there are no tears.\\" Desire takes many forms and at times a desire that is fulfilled is also the cause for tears. We may also fear the loss of what we desire or desire something we can't have and so are then frustrated.What can you do in the first twelve weeks of life that will ensure a baby doesn't cry as much in the future?How do parents in tribal situations deal with crying?Why do some cultures promote weeping and expect demonstrative grief, whileother cultures shun the idea to the point of removing a weeping person from the scene of a funeral?Why are men more comfortable with crying in our modern society?A discussion on childcare unveils a few details that didn't seem pertinent to the topic at hand, but do reveal a certain curiosity of the author. The way he explores this topic made me think he may in fact have written this book for an audience of psychologists. While this book is very intriguing, it doesn't seem to reach out to the casual reader, nor does it keep specifically to the topic of emotions.For the adventurous reader, the topics expand and travel to new destinations, opening the mind to ideas that relate very much to the dimensions of the soul and the deeper understandings of how humans function on all levels of existence. This is not a casual study of emotions, but more of an in depth discussion of everything related to crying and its cultural significance. This topic is fascinating and if you have an interest in Homer, Freud, Plato, Shakespeare, Socrates, Darwin, Hippocrates, Aristotle, Dostoyevsky, Dorothy Parker, D.H. Lawrence, Daniel Goleman and Dr. Benjamin Spock, then this is your book.Philosophy, psychology, medical terminology and cultural expectation are all cleverly woven together to create a fascinating and well-researched unveiling of why we cry. If you want to research this topic even more, there are lists of movies and books within the pages of this book to keep you busy for years! If you love this book, you may enjoy books by Daniel Goleman, especially \\"Emotional Intelligence.\\"~The Rebecca Review"},{"Title":"Crying: A Natural and Cultural History of Tears","review":"I admired Lutz's throughness in accruing examples, and there are many interesting sidebars and historical illustrations, but there's almost no point to this book at all.

Mr. Lutz does a very comprehensive job of looking at tears through the eye of history and humanities. I learned by reading this book that tears weren't always taboo. In some cultures, crying was a source of strength vs a sign of weakness. Tears are natural release that can facilitate bonding with another person (be it on a platonic friendship or romantic/sexual level) as well as psychically and psychologically healthy as well as being spiritually healing.

I'm not kidding"},{"Title":"Witnesses of the Messiah (Kingdom Studies)","review":"A tenet common to both genuinely Christian exegesis and redaction criticism - critique of biblical texts as compositional works - is that understanding the human author's perspective and intent is central to reliably interpreting his writings. Stephen Pimentel skillfully exemplifies this tenet in his exposition of Acts. In particular, Mr. Pimentel's diligent yet concise exegesis persuasively presents extensive and textually well-grounded evidence that Luke's perspective excluded any dichotomy of biblical theology and historicity, contrary to the presumption widespread in modern biblical criticism. Mr. Pimentel's work is especially pertinent to the corollary of this presumption, which is that New Testament authors typically compromised historicity for the sake of advancing their theological \\"agenda.\\" As Mr. Pimentel shows, the text of the New Testament, and in particular Acts, strongly indicates that such a compromise would have been unthinkable to the authors of the New Testament. As Mr. Pimentel shows, these men viewed the New Covenant as culminating a theologically significant and historically real development of God's covenantal relationship with Israel.Mr. Pimentel's exposition is thorough enough to gratify the formally trained student of Scripture, while remaining highly readable to non-scholars. This exposition principally consists of surfacing the literal \\"saturation\\" of Acts in Old Testament subtexts underlying the direct citations and quotations of Old Testament Scripture. As Mr. Pimentel convincingly shows, these pervasive subtexts clearly indicate Luke's insight into the significance of the New Covenant Church: as the covenant community established and advanced by Jesus Christ through the Holy Spirit, the Church is the definitive fulfillment of God's covenantal promises to Israel from Abraham to David. This insight has tremendous religious significance, which Mr. Pimentel ably assists the believing or searching reader to grasp through helpful reflections at the end of each concise chapter. Yet Mr. Pimentel's work has a distinct critical value as well, for the New Testament's message cannot be properly understood apart from an intellectually honest accounting for the authors' perspective of that message."},{"Title":"Witnesses of the Messiah (Kingdom Studies)","review":"This study is truly divine. We just finished this in our Parish's women's bible study and we never have enough time, even with two hours set aside, to discuss everything. The nice thing about the format is that if you want to read the chapters from the bible you can but you do not have to as it has five pages of concise, easy to follow, thought provoking commentary. There are usually five to seven questions at the end of each chapter. The only thing is that you have to really spend some time flipping back and forth in the bible to all of the OT and NT references in the questions in addition to the catechism. It is worth the effort and truly felt like a study instead of reading and then genuflecting. I learned so much about Catholicism, Tradition, Old testament portents to the coming of Christ, The Holy Spirit as a living and breathing being and where our Church roots first began. I am looking forward to continuing the rest of Acts in Witness of the Messiah."},{"Title":"Witnesses of the Messiah (Kingdom Studies)","review":"This small Bible study book is a part of the Kingdom Series published by Emmaus Road out of Steubenville, Ohio. This small series of books (4 books total) focus upon the overarching theme of the Davidic Kingdom in the New Testament. This text is fairly short at 141 pages of larger than normal typeface with a couple of pages of reflection questions and blank writing space at the end of each chapter. The writing style is accessible to the average layperson, and the author's conclusions are well thought out.In \\"Witnesses of the Messiah,\\" Stephen Pimentel consistently shows how Luke wrote his Acts of the Apostles with the Old Testament in mind. Pimentel points out the various literary allusions to the Old Testament and how these allusions (as well as the explicit citations of the Old Testament) can help us understand the narrative better. Sometimes he will even give a transliteration of the Greek to help the average reader understand these allusions.There are three main themes in Acts of the Apostles, which Pimentel explains. First, Luke portrays the time directly after the ascension of Jesus as a time of intercovenantal transition when the Deuteronomic covenant was about to come to its visible end with the destruction of the Temple. The actions of the apostles and the Christian communities display a keen awareness that divine judgment will soon befall Jerusalem (and it did in 70 A.D. with the first Jewish-Roman War and the seige & destruction of Jerusalem). One example is the selling of land and homes in Jerusalem immediately after Pentecost. More than radical charity, this is a pretty good economic choice. Why keep your land and home investments, when they are about to lose cash value due to a national disaster?The second major theme is that of the Davidic Kingdom. Now that Jesus Christ is enthroned as king over his kingdom in the Ascension, he reigns through the Apostles' ministry by means of the Holy Spirit. Through the earthly ministry of his ministers, Jesus reunites the 12 tribes of Israel. Considering the fact that 10 of these 12 tribes were assimilated nearly completely among the Gentiles, the apostolic mission to the Gentiles (those non-Jewish nations or people) is the means by which all of Israel - all 12 tribes - will be restored into the united kingdom under the Son of David: the Church.This leads us into the third and final theme: that of incorporation of the Gentiles into the Church. Pimentel carefully analyzes the events leading up to and including the Council of Jerusalem in Acts 15, which solved a major problem of evangelizing the Gentiles: whether they should follow the dictates of the Mosaic Law. Since the Law (i.e. the Mosaic Law) was a national law meant for the Deuteronomic Covenant, it is no longer binding upon those who have entered the New Covenant and who have now received the law of this New Covenant: the New Law of the Holy Spirit.This concise and well-written Bible study would do well, I think, on the parish level with small groups. As a parish director of adult formation, I intend to use this text as the textbook for just such an endeavor in the near future."},{"Title":"Apocalypse: Moses Before the Exodus","review":"This book is a compelling mix of history and thought.

The whole play takes place in the park and the characters have fairly equal time on the stage, which is helpful to know if you are thinking of producing this one. This is an easy one for a high school drama class to do or for a college theater department looking for one-acts. It can be done with minimal scenery/props. The only 3 must-haves are something that could pass for a fountain (such as a plastic birdbath), a hat, and a shoe. Costumes are not difficult either.

The book serves as a devastating critique of our foreign policy illusions. Simply put: The image is democracy; The reality is imperialism. Parenti is probably the most consistent high-profile academic courageous enough to trace public policy to class interest. Noam Chomsky is also a high-profile and consistent critic of American imperialism, but he refrains from either using the word or from offering a class analysis. Parenti takes the analysis one step further. One might fault this book for being short on documentation, but those familiar with Parenti's works understand the documentation is present in his other, more narrowly-focused books. Thus, &quot;Against Empire&quot; serves as something of an introduction to the author's invaluable other works.One of the book's more personal chapters concerns empire in academia with which professor Parenti has first-hand experience. His discussion of quiet and sometimes noisy faculty purges gives the lie to illusions of free speech in academe. He makes clear that if department heads won't oust politically troublesome faculty, then trustees - usually made up of business elites and political appointees - will do the dirty work. One way or the other, empire requires that class conscious teachers must be kept from talking to students about the systematic effects of wealth and imperialism on their lives.Parenti's exposure of capitalism-disguised-as-democracy is refreshing. Because of capital's tainted and bloody history, empire's propagandists couch their defenses in terms of democratic ideals rather than the more truthful money-grubbing imperatives of actual policy making. Fed a steady dose of this doubletalk, an uncritical public either repeats the idealizing refrain, or, if more critical, becomes cynical about politics in general. Either way, a potentially restive voting public is effectively neutralized. Far from expressing anything like a popular will, capitalist-style democracy subverts this will into a management technique of directing and controlling popular dissent. When anything like popular will challenges empire's basic institutions (as in the case of Vietnam), force can and will be used against it. In practice, American capital prefers the control mechanism of cosmetic democracy to direct authoritarian rule. But it will never sacrifice its narrow class interests to a reality of popular sovereignty. Agree or disagree, this is a work to ponder."},{"Title":"Against Empire","review":"I've been reading Parenti's books for a couple of years, and seeking out his articles and lectures. Reading Against Empire was my first exposure to the man. He characterizes the United States as an Empire, in the classic sense, demolishes your ability to look at your country in any other way, and then goes on to discuss practically every aspect of US foreign and domestic policy in terms of how it serves an active and malignant Empire. His class anaylsis makes itr impossible to ever again percieve U.S. roles in world finance, war, humanitarian missions, etc the same way again. Before, I wondered why we might intervene here but not there, why a war at this time and not another, etc. Parenti cuts through the mystery and exposes again and again the class interests that drive our policy. And he does so in blunt, sometimes deadpan humor and with a remarkably clear vision. Also read his new book, Blackshirts and Reds, about fascism. And if you get a chance, order tapes of his lectures"},{"Title":"Against Empire","review":"The writer from Houston (TX) says this book is an intellectual fraud. He says so analysing one chapter in particular, or one criticism exposed in the book. Another reader from Wichita (KS) centers his criticism over the recurring distinction between communists and/or nazis. They both narrow they disliking for the book around only two of the many issues faced by Parenti's analysis. To them I ask this question: do you still deny everything else exposed in the book? I'm not suggesting to \\"drink\\" everything Parenti says as being true, but the main issue that lies at the very heart of his book is the subtle ways trhough which America tries to rule the world. Interfering in other countries political affairs, and then showing itself as being the savior of the oppressed is very disgusting, but hard to face for many Americans. Indeed very easy for those who see things from the outside because they are foreigners. The book is worth to be read just to be aware that things are different than the way CNN tells you."},{"Title":"Against Empire","review":"I bought this book about three years ago. When I first tried to read it, I couldn't get very far because the subject matter was unfamiliar to me. I mean, what is all this \\"imperialism\\" stuff? Since then, a US administration has grabbed power in a judicial coup d'etat and now wields a brazen imperial style of rule.So, going through my bookshelves, I picked up Mr. Parenti's \\"Against Empire\\" and started reading again. If you, like me, have wondered why the rich get richer and poor get poorer; why the wealthy are always favored; why the common people kill and die in dubious wars while the rich reap the rewards; why the corporate media censors dissenting views; and why our country operates in ways that defy common sense or exemplify hypocrisy; then this book is for you.Mr. Parenti's talent is putting matters that seem complicated into terms that the layman can understand. For example, his explanation of the distinction between government and the state is revelatory. He also gives the reader historical context and easily verfiable examples to back up his assertions. Halfway through \\"Against Empire\\" you will better understand what goes on behind the doors of power and why.Remember \\"The Matrix\\"? Well, \\"Against Empire\\" is like a red pill that you have to chew, and once you've digested it you'll see with open eyes. If you're unprepared for the truth, resume swallowing the blue pill of cable TV news. Or, read \\"A People's History of the United States\\" by Howard Zinn and \\"The Best Democracy Money Can Buy\\" by Greg Palast, then begin reading Parenti's \\"Against Empire.\\""},{"Title":"Against Empire","review":"This was the first of many books I've read by Michael Parenti, and remains my favorite. There exist numerous books that get into more detail regarding the history that Parenti regurgitates, but for a book that's roughly 200 pages, this sums up imperialism pretty well.There will be two different types of people reading this book. The people who will read this that will reinforce the their conviction that the United States was, and remains an imperialist country, and those who reject that America is even an \\"Empire\\" to begin with, thus disputing the very premise of the book. The latter will despise this book due to its very raw and blunt breakdown.One could deny that America is an imperialist country, I suppose, just as one can deny that the Ukraine was under the thumb of the Soviet Union because the Ukraine had their own table at the U.N., but one doesn't have to commence an extensive investigation to comprehend the absurdity of that notion. For example, this book points out the unpleasant truth that post-World War 2 (the timeframe most of this book is dedicated to) the United States has sustained countless dictatorships via military, economy and political support, and, although professing an allegiance to democracy in the Third World, overthrowing dozens of elected governments. Why? Because their polices were not in accordance with that of American business wellbeing, yet those dictators supported were subservient to those same interests.So in essence, Parenti does a wonderful job of explaining how America habitually selects the type of society people in a country will live under and sends support to maintain the leaders the United States designates as \\"appropriate\\". He also does a great hob of explaining how imperialism keeps underdeveloped nations underdeveloped through institutional obstacles, such as large scale industry from the richer country taking over the smaller indigenous ones, thus retarding the growth and development of their own capital.Anton BateyAnton_Batey@yahoo.com"},{"Title":"Against Empire","review":"I've read the other reviews here and I must say one thing: those who claim that Parenti is crying \\"conspiracy\\" have no idea what they're talking about. Perhaps the fact that this is so far-reaching and exaggerated makes them assume the extreme. Most critics of the U.S. government, from the right and left, will agree that the atrocities made in the name of capitalism (not 'democracy' as we are so often told) by the U.S. are endless and without conscience. Parenti points this out. Parenti does what the blurb on the front cover of the book contends: he gives a \\"Brilliant expos&eacute; of the brutal realities of U.S. Global Domination\\" with well founded and backing statistics.For those who maintain that this is an opinion piece, I tell you that this is the idea that the writer intends, to expose through example- for you need not \\"quote\\" history- the true Evil that is the U.S. capitalist military machine.Let's not get lost in scholarly exercises of citing and the endless circle of recycling the words of others. Parenti has something to say here and he says it well."},{"Title":"Against Empire","review":"For those who think one requires endless \\"documentation\\" and \\"proof\\" to ascertain the level to which the U.S. Corporateacracy has obliterated (and continues to obliterate) our few remaining freedoms, one need only look around oneself and develop a heart of compassion for those who suffer under the iron fist of capitalism. Yes, documentation and proof (of which Dr. Parenti has a sufficient amount) are helpful, but one can only provide so much of it until it becomes painfully apparent that one need only observe his/her immediate environment to figure out that life is less than tolerable. AGAINST EMPIRE is yet another salient and sharply accurate appraisal of a society owned and operated by those who sit atop a massive mountain of cold, hard, cash, mostly white men who percieve those below them as they would lint to be brushed off of their well-starched and pressed suits. Those who accuse Parenti of being \\"fraudulent\\" or pandering \\"too much\\" towards the radical left spectrum are simply rightists who don't like him for being a leftist. They themselves offer little (if anything) amounting to \\"evidence\\" to support their ad hominem jabs. Parenti is, as the cliche goes, tellin' it like it is, and they don't much like that a wit. Parenti is SCARY in his honesty, and they don't like THAT either. For those who want a picture of just how disturbing the \\"American Dream\\" really is, one need look no further than Dr. Michael Parenti and AGAINST EMPIRE.

He also mentions the American and European interference in the Middle Eastern oil producing countries after WWII. True. The problem is he talks about it almost as little as I just did. He thinly mentions it in passing to impress the reader with his knowledge. The rest of the book reads like a fictional bashing of America with no basses in reality.

Perhaps that's an argument of Parenti that even my young (seventeen), liberal mind won't be able to accept his radial ideas.I didn't find this book very credible even though the statistics are endless. However, any time I bring up statistics my dad reminds me that anything can be proved with numbers. If I want lots of numbers I can read Howard Zinn, who gives evidence for what he says. (Zinn's book &quot;A People's History of the United States&quot; has a full length bibliography, which is several hundred pages, for each of the chapters. I did hear that Parenti has more documentation in his other books, which I haven't read)Is Parenti a major conspiracy theorist? He says what seems to be unreasonable and lays it on thickly.Parenti is a good writer and his writing is a welcome alternative to the text-book sludge and \\"Great Books\\" series with their notions of how and why we should be patriotic. This is the first Parenti book I've read and I'm not attacking him as a writer. I don't think 'Against Empire' will sway many readers. It may be only for a niche."},{"Title":"Against Empire","review":"This book is not serious scholarship, it is merely an op-ed piece. The author, Michael Parenti does not provide any footnotes to back up his claims; strange coming from a scholar from Yale. No matter how much is said that conforms to my beliefs about politics it simply cannot be relied on as there is almost no evidence within."},{"Title":"Against Empire","review":"This is a great book...provided you want neither facts nor logic to support your ideas. The section, &quot;Lefties Need Not Apply,&quot; on page 184 is particularly illuminating. I, of course, am not a leftist, but I do try to consider other points of view. I can not, however, consider Mr. Parenti anything but a complete fraud. Everything he says about the universities flies in the face of my experience. Does he actually expect us to believe that Women's Studies departments, Anthropology departments (whose guiding principle is cultural relativism), Sociology departments (whose entire analysis rests on race, class, and gender), multiculturalism requirements, and a whole host other elements essential to the universities are anything other than leftism? When given a long list of statistics with no documentation I can only ignore them. When given information that is so blatantly false I can only think that Mr. Parenti is engaging in a case of massive intellectual fraud. Another reviewer said that Mr. Parenti's other books do have extensive documentation. Would you accept that excuse if it came from someone whose views you profoundly disagreed with?"},{"Title":"Cuban Cigar Tobacco: Why Cuban Cigars Are the World's Best","review":"Although not an exciting read, this book should greatly interest the die-hard cigar aficionado and the botanist alike; it contains wonderful photographs and information on traditional and newly developed tobacco varieties, diseases, processing and cultivation."},{"Title":"Apocalypse of Baruch","review":"The book reviewed here is a reprint of \\"the Apocalypse of Baruch\\" or \\"Syriac Apocalypse of Baruch\\". It's a smaller hard cover edition that is still available and reasonably priced if you look hard enough.Mr. Hoffman did an extensive review that is quite accurate.I would only add the following observations:The Index I in the back of the book is valuable in that it lists parallel passages from Scripture with the Apocalypse of Baruch,Ethiopic Enoch,Slavonic Enoch, and the books of 4 and 5 Ezra(Esdras?).One interesting passage in the book reads \\"Nevertheless,they hid all the vessels of the Sanctuary,lest the enemy should get possession of them.\\" This gives some credence to the theory that Jeremiah hid these items.Also mentioned are \\"Leviathan\\" and \\"Behemoth\\".The footnotes are plentiful and informative.With the passage of time this book has been taken more seriously. Particular after the two World Wars and fulfillment of prophecies in the book."},{"Title":"Taj Mahal: Autobiography of a Bluesman","review":"This book is portraying this bluesman in his own words, but also by the words of many others. It is unfair to label this as a \\"bad\\" book just by the fact that it is not an autobiography. And people complain about reading about his life. . . a book about a musician would not be a book if it didn't focus on his life. You can hear the music, but you need to read his life. This is a well written book with many celebrity interviews about this influential artist. I've bought this book for several people with no regrets. . .they don't regret reading it either. They do nothing but rave about it, and that's all that I can do."},{"Title":"Taj Mahal: Autobiography of a Bluesman","review":"I truly loved this book about a legendary bluesman. He seemed to be up-front and honest about his personal life and trials as well as experiences in the cutthroat world of music as business. Interviews-with/comments-from &quot;stars&quot; in the music industry like Linda Ronstadt, Bonnie Raitt and Mick Jagger showed just what an indelible mark Taj has made on their lives. Stories from Taj's family were poignant."},{"Title":"Taj Mahal: Autobiography of a Bluesman","review":"Stephen Foehr is a master of networking. I can tell you, because I copy edited much of this book, that bringing it to publication was a Herculean chore. Taj Mahal's internationl concert schedule and complex family relations made him an elusive, sometimes reluctant, contributor to the project. Foehr was forced to tell the story as much by contacting Taj's myriad kin, fellow musicians, friends, and others as by getting Taj to tell it in his own words. The result is a rich, multifaceted combination of autobiography and biography that provides a classic example of the genre as well as a fascinating portrait of its subject, the world of the blues, Taj's family and friends, and a history of the blues in the last 40 or 50 years. Taj's supporting cast, his friends and antagonists, comprise a gallery of equally gifted and admiraqble characters. Foehr's relentless and creative networking with them and tracking them down made this book possible. Taj's complex, talented, intriguing life has been given its definitive treatment."},{"Title":"Taj Mahal: Autobiography of a Bluesman","review":"I thought this book was so interesting and it wasn't filled with too many minute music details that you put it down and return to more details about a certain track that you get bored. If you want an interesting book about a real well traveled man in music and you like Taj Mahal then what's not to like? I was crazy about the book and I'm not an overly crazed Taj fan despite seeing him many times. Simple - very good 'page turner' book that says a lot about the man and a lot about his experiences in life to make his music unique."},{"Title":"Taj Mahal: Autobiography of a Bluesman","review":"There are two major problems with this book. First, for someone as passionate about music as Taj, there is very little about Taj's music in the book. Other than the author's experiences at a few shows, there is little discussion of Taj's classic albums. It isn't until page 236 of the 280 page text that we get any substantive discussion of Taj's music. Instead we get overwhelmed with stories of Taj's 15 kids by about half a dozen women. Whether he's at fault or not, it gets really boring reading about Taj's kids and lovers talking about how Taj wasn't there for them.The second problem with the book is the subject himself. Despite appearing to be a willing interviewee, Taj reveals himself to be one of those people who is simply incapable of answering the question, &quot;How did this make you feel?&quot; When pressed for his feelings on events in his life, Taj invariably steers his answers into discussions on fishing or food or music.The author obviously made a solid effort to compile an oral history of Taj's life, but would have been better served by focusing less on people's thoughts on Taj himself and more on people's opinions on Taj's music."},{"Title":"Taj Mahal: Autobiography of a Bluesman","review":"The best way for me to describe this book is this. I will simply quote the announcer who introduces Taj on his live album \\"The Real Thing\\"...\\"If you didn't come here with a friend, you have one on the stage right now, Mr. Taj Mahal!\\"."},{"Title":"Taj Mahal: Autobiography of a Bluesman","review":"I am a huge fan of this great artist. But I have a problem with the book. It's not an autobiography. The real author must've cut some sort of deal with taj, because the real writer patiently gathered info from all corners of the earth. The only thing Taj seems to have done is a few lenghty interviews. It was disappointing to read of someone who has been so musically inspiring and yet so flawed as a regular guy. He's fathered over a dozen children by several women, yet the book desperately tries to portray him as a man of integrity and high moral fibre.Taj has followed in the old bluesman tradition of loving and leaving. His legacy is littered with testimonials of people who desperately want to recognize his goodness, and yet the wounds his lifestyle has left them with are huge.The New Age, hippie rationales that his 'family' blabs on and on with is almost laughable, unfortunately tragic.Unless you are a real fan of this musical genius, don't bother with the book. Check out his albums instead."},{"Title":"Arco Electrical and Electronic Systemsfor Ase Test A6 (Chek-Chart's Ase Study Guides)","review":"The electrical A6 book really helped me pass the exam.

I appreciate the fact that Russ's DS is never mentioned in the book, it's just a fact. The pictures are beautiful and the story itself is lovely. I love the lesson Russ gets about doing the right thing and the fact that he is an example to his friend Kevin. I just wish that Janet Rickert would write more Russ books.

It describes an interesting series of events, centred on a character who happens to have a disability, but this disability is not the focus of the book. Russ is similar to other students in his interests, activities and problems. The storyline is simple yet interesting as it presents a wonderful school day for Russ. All children would love to imagine a fun filled day similar to his experience. He must make a difficult decision that other children can relate to, and several of his emotions are expressed through the colourful, appealing photographs on each page. There are no stereotypes or labels used, all settings are inclusive of someone with a disability, and all situations show Russ in valued roles, as an active and contributing individual. I highly recommend it as a valuable example of how inclusive children's literature should be written. It would be an asset to any school or home library.Joan McHale"},{"Title":"Russ and the Almost Perfect Day (Day with Russ)","review":"This is just one in a series of lovely stories about the adventures of Russ.

I was expecting a Houdini style escape, perhaps on multiple occasions or repeated attempts; however I became enthralled with the story, Rhone's character, and his relationships. I disagree with the reviewer that accuses the book of getting bogged down in the middle. Quite the contrary, the action and events were fast paced throughout. The characters had more depth and believability than those of much more reknown authors (such as Lee Childs). I could not put the book down for the last 75 pages, and enjoyed the ending as well.

Along the way he falls in love with the woman pretending to be his sister and then gets himself sent to a Siberian work camp (he doesn't meet Ivan Denisovitch, though).The whole book is very dreary and slow going.

Inevitably, there is a bias in favor of the last half-century - it is what the author has seen at first hand and it is what anybody buying the book will have seen.Julian, who fronted BBC TV's racing coverage for many years so is more familiar with such horses, admits to a bias in favor of Britain and Ireland. Only nine American horses (Cigar, Citation, Kelso, Man O' War, Native Dancer, Seattle Slew, Secretariat, War Admiral and Jay Trump) and one Canadian (Northern Dancer) are featured. Some of the others were bred in America, including Mill Reef, Nijinsky and Sir Ivor, but ran their races in Europe. There are also a few horses from elsewhere, mostly France.Of course, the lack of American horses makes this an ideal companion for similar books by American writers. Such books tend to define the 100 best racehorses very differently, focusing mainly or exclusively on American horses.Aside from any dispute about which horses are the 100 best ever, this is a well-illustrated book which gives a good summary of each horse's story, together with a list of big race wins and a pedigree going back four generations. Each horse gets 2 or 3 pages including pictures - usually photographs, but a painting in the case of those horses that pre-date photography.Anybody interested in great British and Irish racehorses is unlikely to find a better book of this type.Note - although this is listed as unavailable here, it is available in the UK on ISBN 0316644684"},{"Title":"Shy the Platypus (Young Australia Series)","review":"My Australian aunt sent me this book as a present when I was 9 and I still have very warm memories of the story and the beautifully life like pictures.

Well worth the money.Enjoy."},{"Title":"We'll Always Have Parrots (Meg Langslow Mysteries)","review":"Meg knew she would be in for a busy and trying weekend when she agreed to accompany her boyfriend Michael to a fan convention for Porfiria, Queen of the Jungle. Trying because Michael was the breakout romantic star of the cheesy scifi tv show and most of his fanbase wished Meg would disappear. Busy because Meg had a booth at the accompanying craft fair to sell her handcrafted ironwork, including swords and daggers featured on the show. What she didn't realize that the situation would be made even busier and more trying by the release of monkeys and parrots by overzealous fans who were trying to turn the generic chain hotel/convention center into a more realistic jungle setting and the murder of the show's temperamental owner/star. Once again Meg, in her neverending quest to impose order on the chaos that seems to follow her and her quirky family finds herself on the trail of a murderer.This is the fifth in the Meg Langslow series of comic cozy mysteries featuring ornamental blacksmith Meg, her actor/professor boyfriend Michael and their eccentric extended family. All of the series, which began with MURDER WITH PEACOCKS, have some sort of bird tie-in in the titles, characters that appear in the farcical stories to some degree. This series manages to find a good balance between the cozy (the charming cast of recurring characters), comic (the situations that Meg and her family find themselves in are reminiscent of the best I Love Lucy plots) and mysteries that have at least a twist or two that will surprise the reader. The overall story arc of this series is quite pronounced so for maximum enjoyment begin at the beginning and proceed in order."},{"Title":"We'll Always Have Parrots (Meg Langslow Mysteries)","review":"I love this series.

No character development and a weird repetition of what would hopefully been a plot. I added a collection on my Kindle called \\"Rejects\\"."},{"Title":"We'll Always Have Parrots (Meg Langslow Mysteries)","review":"Donna Andrews is a favorite of mine because of her humor -- her books are full of burst out laughing lines and situations. This book is no exception. The setting is a \\"con\\" -- a convention of fans of a Xena-type television show. Her detective Meg (also a blacksmith who makes decorative items, swords, etc. -- not a shoer of horses blacksmith) has a boyfriend with a role in the show so she's there with a vendor's booth and her boyfriend. The convention is zany, with most of the attendees dressed as characters in the show, and the conveners have decorated the hotel to look like a jungle, complete with parrots and monkeys. Unfortunately, the parrots and monkeys get out of their cages, and to judge from this book, there are a lot of parrots and monkeys loose in the hotel, causing chaos with their stealing (the monkeys) and imitating sounds (the parrots). The Xena-type character, Porfiria, is disliked thoroughly by everyone on the show -- she's a Queen B, and I don't mean bee. Someone gets murdered, and Meg is the first one to find the body. She begins her own little investigation in this crazy little world (the Porfiria con goes on).I don't think this is Andrews' best, but it's still well worth a read. It made me want to go to one of these cons to see if they're really as zany as the one she describes. I think anyone who has attended one of these will find this book particularly funny."},{"Title":"We'll Always Have Parrots (Meg Langslow Mysteries)","review":"Another great book by Donna Andrews, featuring her no-nonsense crime solver, Meg Langslow.

She introduces fairly well-rounded characters in each book, but doesn't lose herself in fleshing them out more than necessary. Readers are given just what they need to follow a sometimes-complicated network of interactions, and Andrews has a large pool from which to pick her murderers."},{"Title":"We'll Always Have Parrots (Meg Langslow Mysteries)","review":"as with all Donna Andrews books in the Meg Lanslow, funny, well-paced and very enjoyable"},{"Title":"We'll Always Have Parrots (Meg Langslow Mysteries)","review":"It's an ordinary convention, celebrating the stars of a 'B' grade television show, Porfira, Queen of the Jungle. Meg Langslow accompanies her actor-boyfriend Michael and hopes to sell some of her swords (Meg is a blacksmith). But ordinary SF conventions are anything but ordinary. Parrots and monkeys escape and run wild in the hotel, space-suit clad fans mingle with angry writers and actors, and everyone is angry with leading lady Wynncliffe-Jones. But when the actress ends up killed, her dying words echoed by an African Gray parrot, Meg knows she needs to get to the bottom of the mystery. Because if she doesn't, her boyfriend is likely to be a chief suspect.With occasional assistance from her nerotic doctor-father, Meg explores the world of comic books (graphic novels) on which Porfira was based, the 1960s culture that spawned some pretty good art and bad story-telling, and the web of contracts and bad will that Wynncliffe-Jones used to maintain control over the Porfira franchise.This was a very funny book. Author Donna Andrews has an eye for the zany world of fantasy fans, prima-donna actors, and ambivalent family relations. Protagonist Meg Langslow makes a good and sympathetic character with real personality and skills.I picked up my first Meg Langslow mystery, Crouching Buzzard, Leaping Loon, because of the title and WE'LL ALWAYS HAVE PARROTS is another great title. What's great, though, is finding a book that can live up to a title like this. And Andrews delivers exactly that book. Anyone who enjoys a slightly zany approach to mystery, kick-ass female protagonists, and a tongue-in-cheek look at American culture will want to get their hands on this one. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"We'll Always Have Parrots (Meg Langslow Mysteries)","review":"I think the Meg Langslow mysteries are charming, funny, and witty and I very much looked forward this installment. I did not find We'll Always Have Parrots up to that standard. Like the other characters in the book, I did not lament that the victim was murdered and about halfway through the book I decided that I no longer cared who murdered her. I went ahead and finished it until the end but it took longer than previous Donna Andrews' books. For some reason I found the almost exclusive use of calling the main character the QB annoying and after a while I just wanted all the parrots and monkeys to fade into the background. I missed Michael and Meg's father playing more prominent roles. With Michael playing such a minor role and he being the reason behind Meg's desire to solve the mystery, I just felt it could have been better. Every series has their less than best book. We'll Always Have Parrots was that one for me but I look forward to the next one in hopes that it will be as enjoyable as the first three were."},{"Title":"We'll Always Have Parrots (Meg Langslow Mysteries)","review":"Blacksmith Meg Langslow accompanies her fianc&eacute;, drama professor and actor, Michael to the Friends of Amblyiopia convention though neither wants to attend. Michael has a minor part in the cult hit TV series Porfiria, Queen of the Jungle that requires him to grace several of these events as insisted upon by the executive producer Tamerlaine Wynncliffe-Jones, who also stars in the title role. Michael hopes he can persuade the unpredictable star to give him a break, but expects nothing but grief from QB as everyone calls Tamerlaine behind her back.Following the release of screeching parrots, someone kills the unpopular star. The police quickly learn that many people associated with the show and some just attending the convention detested the victim. Unable to perch on the sidelines and not trusting the police to follow the real clues amidst a pageant of costumed characters, Meg investigates the murder, unaware that if she learns the truth a buzzard will kill her.The fifth murder so fowl Langslow amateur sleuth tale is an amusing mystery that pokes fun at hero worship that places stars on pedestals. The only seriousness in this very humorous story line is Meg's inquiries into the homicide. Fans will delight in the zaniness of the support cast whether they are a monkey, parrots protesting their candy cotton candy roles in the TV show, actors who cannot use any pronoun but I, and Meg's wacky family. Still Meg as in the previous terrific bird brained who-done-its is the glue that keeps the plot together. Donna Andrews furbishes a fabulously loony entry in her delightful offbeat series.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"We'll Always Have Parrots (Meg Langslow Mysteries)","review":"Hoping to sell some of her swords and daggers to an sf/f crowd, Meg has accompanied her actor/drama teacher boyfriend, Michael, to a fan convention for the cheesy sf TV series he stars on, \\"Porphyria: Queen of the Jungle\\". Michael, who plays Mephisto, the mercenary wizard on the series, has a slightly more difficult agenda then playing the genial star for adoring fans--he is hoping to get the tyrannical star of the series, Tammerlaine Wyncliffe-Jones, to modify his contract so he won't lose his teaching job. However, when the \\"Queen Bee\\" is found murdered, Michael (and Meg) have a different problem: keeping Michael out of jail.Another triumph for Donna Andrews featuring her best-drawn villain to date. Although this isn't the first murder mystery set at an sf/f convention, this is the first one I've read where the author genuinely likes the phenomena and views both the fans and the conventions with humor and sympathy. SF/F fans like me will certainly see themselves and recognize the situations Meg encounters and the people she meets. Although Meg's eccentric family are not much in evidence, the colorful character quota is more than filled by the fans and Michael's co-stars on the TV show.Readers who have been following the series will enjoy this new addition. Readers who are new to the series should buy this book and immediately acquire the rest of Andrews' Meg Langslow series at once."},{"Title":"We'll Always Have Parrots (Meg Langslow Mysteries)","review":"Meg isn't thrilled to be spending the weekend at the convention for Porfiria, the TV show that boyfriend Michael stars in. This year's festivities have been enhanced by the addition of monkeys and parrots, which have escaped from their cages and are wandering the hotel at random. Meg is hoping to make some money off her swords in the dealer room to keep the weekend from being a complete loss.All that's before the star of the show is murdered. Nicknamed the QB (which doesn't stand for Queen Bee), there isn't a person who works on the show who didn't have some beef with her. Despite protests that she's not going to get involved, Meg begins collecting clues. But can she follow them back to the real killer before the convention ends?If you are at all familiar with the books in the Meg Langslow series, you know to expect plenty of antics along with your mystery. This book is no exception. Donna Andrews pokes gentle fun at fandom with some of the over the top antics. I grinned and laughed my way through the entire book. At the same time, there's a great mystery. While it takes a while to get going, it is a cleverly plotted story with several nice twists before the ending.Donna Andrews continues to set the bar high for herself. How she manages to juggle everything she puts in these stories is beyond me. But they are a fun ride none-the-less. If you love humorous mysteries, be sure to check this series out."},{"Title":"We'll Always Have Parrots (Meg Langslow Mysteries)","review":"When I read the previous book to this one, \\"Crouching Buzzard, Leaping Loon\\", I loved everything about the book and worried that it was just because heroine Meg was in a world I adored (computer game development) and her boyfriend was far away. This latest installment sets my fears to rest. Michael is fully back in the picture here, and the story couldn't be better. In fact he's front and center, as his acting career in the cult TV series \\"Porfiria, Queen of the Jungle\\" has brought the dynamic duo to an east coast convention for the weekend. Now, I happen to love sci-fi conventions just as much as I love computer games, so it could be the setting again being a fantastic one, but if author Donna Andrews keeps turning out books like this, I'll be happy for years to come.Just as with pretty much any TV cast set, the actors and actresses have their quirks. There are romantic entanglements in their past, bitter feuds, issues with money, love, family, you name it. None of this comes across as bizarre - it's all quite natural, given the egos involved in many Hollywood situations. The main character, Porfiria, ends up dead only a short while through the con, and of course pretty much everybody is a suspect. I found Meg's reasons for interfering to be a little less compelling than in previous books, though. She wants to clear Michael as a suspect? Heck, he's no more suspected than anybody else. I would believe it more if the book mentioned the many previous mysteries she'd solved and at least gave her some interest in the process. Instead, she vaguely hints at her father's mystery books. It's almost as if they want us to believe, with each subsequent book in the series that it's the very first murder Meg has ever seen. Where, in reality, she seems to attract death like honey attracts bears.That aside, though, the book is great. Meg's sword-making skills fall right in line with sci-fi convention wares, and the characters are interesting and fun. The book easily pegs the behavior of many avid sci-fi fans. In fact, Donna was a little low key and lenient in some areas :) At a real con, putting out a fresh spread of food and beverage would cause a trampling :)I do want to comment that in the previous book Meg was eyeing with interest one of the hunky co-workers at her office - and in this book she's eyeing with interest other guys. It's fine and good to say that Meg is allowed to have open eyes and appreciate human beauty, but it is starting to seem that any time a well built guy shows up, she is pondering in her mind \\"If only I didn't have Michael, I could have enjoyed him ...\\"On the other hand, Meg and Michael have both matured SO much since the first books that I'm hard put to really complain about this minor quirk. Yes, it irks me a bit - but in general Meg has a great combination of tolerance, headstrong interest, intelligence and an ability to take care of herself that I really enjoy her.I really do recommend reading the previous books to understand the whole background on Spike, Michael and the other characters - it makes the tiny moments really rich in layers of meaning.Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"We'll Always Have Parrots (Meg Langslow Mysteries)","review":"In a series of very funny books, this one stands out as the best so far. Donna Andrews has a real talent for writing laugh out loud scenarios. Whenever an animal (or her dad) enters a scene, you know it is going to be uniquely written, extremely funny and never disappointing. This one, with parrots, monkeys and a tiger, is my favorite, so far. Another plus with Andrews is that you do not get the same plot over and over. The settings and situations change. The main characters do not and you would not want them to, since the zanies are becoming favorite relatives, her brother and her dad especially. This is a set of books you can add to your library and know that you will want to come back to again and again. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"We'll Always Have Parrots (Meg Langslow Mysteries)","review":"A wonderful entry in this series! These books are so spritely, so lighthearted, and so just plain fun that they are a joy to read. And this is one of the best of the group. Anyone who has attended a fan convention of any sort (sci-fi, comic book, writer's, tv, etc.) will be helpless with laughter as they recognize the types they've seen (and possibly themselves) at such events. Pure fun."},{"Title":"We'll Always Have Parrots (Meg Langslow Mysteries)","review":"I loved the first book in this series, but this book lacked that same warmth. It is just chock full of totally bizarre characters and not enough of the good characters.

Other titles include \\"Crouching Buzzard, Leaping Loon\\" and \\"Revenge of the Wrought-Iron Flamingos.\\" In this book, Langslow and her fianc&eacute; actor Michael are participants in a weekend fan convention of the cult fantasy show \\"Porfiria, Queen of the Jungle,\\" in which he stars. When the actress who plays the title character turns up murdered, it appears an African grey parrot is the only witness. The hotel hosting the convention is overrun with parrots - and some monkeys - that were supposed to help create a \\"jungle\\" atmosphere for the weekend event, but somehow escaped from their cages. Eventually an escaped grey does play a role in the chasing down the murderer, but not in any conventional sense you might anticipate (but then what else would you expect from a grey?)I found the book to be highly entertaining. The author's characterization of greys is very well done - I could see my own birds (I have two African greys) engaging in some of the behaviors she describes. While I love the story, I do have a problem with the artwork on the cover, however. It features a macaw prominently, as well as a lorikeet - but no greys. (I guess they're not \\"colorful\\" enough.) I would think since they do play a prominent role in the story - more so than any of the other parrots - at least one grey could have been featured on the cover, and still have the more colourful macaw featured, if the publisher really wanted one on the cover. No reason not to buy the book, however.

After reading this work my impression, even after many years, is that the radio play was far superior, and I am left disappointed."},{"Title":"Under the Red Robe","review":"Fun, fast moving adventure novel, which is also a romance. The story is set in 1630. I found it very well written, with a story that kept me wanting to read more, interesting detail (but not too much) and interesting unique expressions (these days, anyway). This novel was written in 1894! After reading this novel, I looked up the author, and was not surprised to read that \\" his authenticity and attention to contextual detail caused his works...to be widely acclaimed for their romantic content and faithful historical accuracy\\". [...]. Even better, this is a free book! Wow!The story begins with a gentleman, while playing cards at his club in Paris, is accused of cheating. Not one to allow an insult like that to go unchallenged, he challenges the young brash fool to a duel. He wounds the young man, and since dueling is illegal and also he has duelled before (and killed 6 men previously), he is brought before Cardinal Richelieu, a very powerful man, who is about to dispense justice. The Cardinal is eventually convinced to give him an option - his life or find and arrest a M. de Cocheforet, most likely through less than upright means, which is distastful, but what choice? The adventure continues from there. And there is a lot of adventure."},{"Title":"Teacher Made Games","review":"When the budget for your early childhood classroom is tight and the money has run out, look to this great resource for hands-on learning games. These games are easily constructed by teachers or parents with readily available and, very often, free materials. The games, which are organized into subject areas of Language, Auditory and Visual Discrimination and Memory, Math, and Gross and Fine Motor Skills, target preschoolers through first grade. Older Special Eduation students would also benefit. Teacher Made Games is also an excellent resource for the home-schooling parent. Photographs of children actually playing the games accompany each set of directions. I recommend this book for education students, teachers, parents and home-schoolers."},{"Title":"The theory of equations: With an introduction to the theory of binary algebraic forms (Dublin University Press series)","review":"This is a classic textbook on the theory of equations, a good follow-up to Higher Algebra, by Knight.

Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"After finishing this book I look back on it and feel as though not much was actually said. I enjoyed the perspective on people reactions to such awful conditions, but, to me the book seemed very wordy.Perhaps this was just due to personal taste and this is not my type of read."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"Although Camus brilliantly provides meaning to his tale, the story is overly enlongated and there is too much wasted description."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"I have to agree with what most reviewers say about Camus' THE PLAGUE: it is definitely not an easy book to read. If I had to describe the book in a simple phrase, it would have to be something like: an existentialist account of a series of profound Dostoevskian characters facing the utmost adversity, a relentless plague, which is an allegory of the evil mankind faces on a daily basis.It is absolutely inevitable for me to compare THE PLAGUE with Jose Saramago's BLINDNESS, and the latter is, in my humble opinion, a much better novel. Saramago's book is much less existentialist and in exchange provides a huge dose of magical realism. It deals with a nameless and timeless city, where all of a sudden the population starts going blind, for no apparent reason whatsoever.Dr. Rieux, Camus' main character, is an atheist who apart from that lacks all type of passion and feeling. He faces the plague in a cool and heartless manner, which simply does not touch me as a reader. Rieux represents a heavy combination of character complexity with an existentialist view of life. He is the absolute anti-hero by definition. Even though he is the one that takes the bull by the horns, he does it simply because he has to do his job. There is absolutely no room for hope in this poor man's soul.As a Nobel laureate, one cannot ignore the fact that Camus is an excellent writer, but he also the type of writer which some people love, and others, like me, do not enjoy that much. I guess one's opinion regarding THE PLAGUE has a lot do with the reason why one reads. I read to enjoy myself, to be transported to other places and times, to feel, love, hate and hope with the characters. I guess if I read the novel, rereading every single page and profoundly analyzing each thought and sentence, I'd have a more positive opinion of THE PLAGUE, but that's not the way I like to read....I like books which transmit passions, both positive and negative. THE PLAGUE simply fell very short..."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"Set in North Africa on the Mediterranean in the 1940's, the town of Oran becomes infested with bubonic plague, at first the authorities pursue a path of denial, finally the town is put under total quarantine for months until the disease has run its course. People are dying by the hundreds each week, some trying to escape or smuggle, some engaged in the most heroic acts of their lives, no one can leave and no one can come into the town as though under a siege.Unfortunately, I found this to be the dullest thing I've read since Naipal's \\"A Bend in the River\\". In spite of the horrific events continually taking place in the book the story went on in the same monotone, passionless style from beginning to end. There is much philosophical insight in the behavior of humans in times of exile and stress from continual fear, but I think this author should have stayed away from fiction and stayed with philosophy or perhaps documentaries.This book was like reading an extremely well written composition but it never engaged my emotions."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"To put it bluntly, The Plague is not the best example of Albert Camus' writing. The Plague was written after The Stranger and before The Fall and acts as a transition state between his other two major works. Somehow though, it is less effective than both its predecessor and its successor.The story is told through the narrative style that Camus favors, but in a more formal and impersonal style than what his readers would be familiar with. There is a noticeable lack of dialogue as the reader is lead through the events surrounding the outbreak of bubonic plague that Camus chronicles, leading to the problem of overly drawn-out passages. Overall, the structuring of this version is honestly very poor with seemingly minimal attention paid to syntactical continuity.Content-wise, The Plague is centered around existentialist ideas and explorations like the rest of Camus' work. Like with every one of his novels, he pursues a different aspect of existentialism by variation of plot and presentation. The Plague explores the meaninglessness of human life aspect of existentialism, through the preoccupation of the villagers of Oran with their \\"business\\" and the meaninglessness in the way a plague begins to wipe out everyone. The intention of this is to prove the common conception that \\"In fact, it comes to this: nobody is capable of really thinking about anyone, even in the worst calamity\\" (241), but the opposite of this is shown by a few select characters. One of the few shining points of this novel is that Camus effectively conveys through his characters the key existentialist idea that while life may be meaningless, man can give himself meaning by struggling against the very meaninglessness he is condemned to.The Plague is not a book for neophytes to the work of Albert Camus. It is neither a well written book nor a shining example of existentialism at its best. Sadly, the story is a wall in and of itself to get over in order to arrive at the point Camus was trying to make. The Plague is the least developed novel of Camus' three, and is definitely not a \\"must-read.\\""},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"The Plague by Albert Camus is neither his greatest work nor a breakthrough piece of literature. This book was just an extremely bland allegory of some parts of the Bible.In the beginning of the book, we see that the town of Oran is absorbed in itself, not really concerned with outside issues. The town is even built so that it faces away from the sea almost as to close itself off from the rest of the world. The town's citizens blindly go about each day just trying to gain monetary success and riches. They are in a self-absorbed ignorant bliss.A plague descends upon this town and their everyday lives are disrupted. Father Paneloux gives a sermon to the frightened town saying that the plague is a sign of God's discontent with the sins of the town. This is of relevance to the biblical flood, which was caused by the people's losing touch with God, and a life of deeper purpose and meaning. As the plague progresses, Father Paneloux changes his view of the plague and calls it an \\"ultimate test of faith\\". Obviously this resonates strongly with the story of Job and how was he was tortured by Lucifer to prove that if indeed Job had full faith in God. Camus describes these incidences with the least amount of care or interest. One might as well read straight from the source of the \\"teachings\\" of The Plague, the Bible.This book had very dry prose that was difficult to get through. Camus's trademark existentialist flavor and intrigue was also sorely lacking, in my opinion. There is nothing in this book that one can't get from elsewhere. Spend your money and time on Le Etranger (The Stranger)."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"Dr. Rieux, the main character of the novel, moves throughout the book in a detached surreal hopeless manner. He goes thru the motions of \\"doing his job\\" while death surrounds him from a wide spread and accelerating plague.I find Jose Saramago's \\"Blindess\\" to be a far superior book to The Plague. Similar theme and concept but more descriptive and moving. The Plague was clinical in its approach - almost bloodless.I found this highly acclaimed book to be very difficult to re-read, often having to re-read many pages over and over. I would pass on this book."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"I found some of Camus' ideas very interesting, but the book could be compacted to under 100 pages. Also, the art in writing a book also includes the art of storytelling, which Camus is not a master of like Jack London. The book also does not possess the depth as those of Faulkner or Joyce, and I found it quite boring. The book is like the town: lifeless."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"I enjoyed the Plague, because of its detail towards all that the narrator was addressing in the novel. The point I didn't like about the book, was the beginnings' difference from the rest of the book and its harsh descriptions of everything happening. The beginning is relevant, however, but the way its written and its context is so different from all the other sections. I liked how the author describes the setting so well that you can picture the little French town in northern Africa and its streets, and you can almost feel the weather that the people feel and their emotions throughout their time. When he describes the summer and the flowers for the funerals you almost want to smell the flowers and to feel the sun and the humid air.I liked the plot of how the people want to get out of their captured town, but they realize that they should be happy with what they have and that they should try to help those who may not survive the plagues onset of pain and death. When the characters struggle with the local authorities to try and escape their dismal situation they are put through even more pain that's not caused by the plague. I liked the way that the main characters dealt with their losses and their gains, but they don't see their gains until the end of the novel. The narrator, in the beginning, is able to make you see and hear the rats in the walls of their town and able to see what happens over the time in the city. When the people die and they run out of places to bury them its sad to think how that could have really happened, and also how it has happened in our own history in the past."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"The events occurred at Oran. An invalid feels out of place in Oran because it is a place of business, of commerce. One day Dr. Bernard Rieux feels something soft underfoot. Townspeople show uneasiness. Rats are coming out to die. Jean Tarrou is a visitor. He find the town ugly. Tarrou's diary entries describe a curious fever that is overcoming some of the occupants of the town. An older colleague, Castel, tells Rieux that the fever is the plague. Plagues and wars take people by surprise.Pursuant to Rieux's urging, a health committee convenes at the Prefect's office. Disease is spreading rapidly. Rieux has a dazed feeling. He comes to realize he is afraid. Instructions are received to declare a state of plague and close the town. It is hard to grasp what is happening. Measures are taken regarding traffic and food supply. Rieux is reproached by a journalist, who is looking for a way to get out of town to be reunited with a lover, that he lives in a world of abstractions. After a time he does not have to steel himself to not feel pity because he grows out of pity during the crisis of the epidemic.A Week of Prayer is organized in Oran. A priest gives a sermon that if the plague is present, the hour has come for taking thought. The town itself is under a sort of incarceration. Some people adapt to the state of affairs and others do not. Realizing their peril, people give their thoughts to pleasure. Tarrou approaches Rieux. He wants to develop a plan for voluntary assistance in coping with the plague. Tarrou says his job in life is giving people chances. Rieux finds the only way of fighting the plague is common decency.By August it seems the plague has eliminated free choice by swallowing up everyone and everything. There is a sense of exile and deprivation. The striking feature of the funerals is the speed. In the end men and women are placed in death pits indiscriminately. When there is no longer romm for burial the victims go to a fiery end. The real plague has nothing in common with grandiose imaginings. The people of Oran develop a habit of despair. Through September and October there is nothing to do but mark time. Rieux is exhausted and has no emotional resources.Tarrou's father was a lawyer, a functionary of the legal system. Tarrou assists in the sanitation work of the plague outbreak because he opposes the death penalty. In winter some of the patients survive the plague. Others are helped by a serum. In February the gates are opened. Tarrou loses the match and dies. Rieux prepares an account to honor the plague-stricken victims."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"When I first read THE PLAGUE 35-40 years ago, I sure did miss a lot. Now, re-reading it as part of my ongoing survey of Camus's writings, I conclude that it is a great novel - one that by itself would justify the award of the Nobel Prize to its author. A rich and multi-faceted work, it is difficult to characterize, in part because, as noted by Margaret Gray, it oscillates \\"between event and abstraction, literal and figurative meaning, chronicle and allegory.\\"The surface tale is of an epidemic of the plague (first bubonic, then also pneumonic) in the Algerian city of Oran in the early 1940's. It dealt horrific deaths to thousands; it brought about the quarantine of the city and the isolation of its residents from the rest of humanity; it deprived the beleaguered inhabitants of hope and a future and gradually enveloped their lives with an oppressive existential miasma. But led by a few resolute souls some of the inhabitants banded together and fought back, not with expectations of eventual victory, but because it was the only decent, the only logical, thing to do.THE PLAGUE was published in 1947, and the obvious \\"real-world\\" analog to the fictional pestilence of Oran was the Nazi occupation of France of 1941-1945. But it would be a mistake to think of THE PLAGUE simply as some sort of allegory of the Nazi Occupation. For Camus, \\"the plague\\" is not an isolated phenomenon. It is an existential condition that is ever-recurring, even ever-present. Near the end of the novel, an old man, commenting on the epidemic, says, \\"But what does that mean--\`plague'? Just life, no more than that.\\" Earlier in the novel, two of its \\"heroes\\" (although both would disavow the term) - Dr. Bernard Rieux and Jean Tarrou (who both can readily be seen as alter egos of Camus himself) - are having a philosophical discussion about what to do in a world without God, a world \\"shaped by death\\". Tarrou observes to the physician Rieux, who doggedly is working around the clock to tend to plague victims, \\"your victories will never be lasting.\\" (Rieux responds, \\"Yes, I know that. But it's no reason for giving up the struggle.\\" Arguably, that is the moral of the novel.)At bottom, THE PLAGUE is a philosophical novel. I personally am finding Camus's philosophy much more comprehensible, and acceptable, as expressed in a literary fashion in his novels than as articulated in his more overtly philosophical non-fiction essays or works, such as \\"The Myth of Sisyphus\\" or \\"The Rebel\\". (This brings to mind the observation - by whom, I forget - to the effect that Sartre had a much greater aptitude for formal philosophy than for literature, whereas with Camus the opposite was true.) In addition to the overarching discussion of pestilence as a metaphor for the human condition, there also are numerous philosophical side-bars. One of the most impassioned and effective has to do with the death penalty; Camus is unequivocally opposed - just two years after he had argued publicly for execution of the worst of the collaborators. Another is this extract:\\"On the whole, men are more good than bad; that, however, isn't the real point. But they are more or less ignorant, and it is this that we call vice or virtue; the most incorrigible vice being that of an ignorance that fancies it knows everything and therefore claims for itself the right to kill. The soul of the murderer is blind; and there can be no true goodness nor true love without the utmost clear-sightedness.\\"I have minor quibbles with the novel. Especially in contrast to \\"The Stranger\\" (published in 1942), which was a work of rare economy and concision, THE PLAGUE is rather expansive, at times even wordy (or windy). I am inclined to think that Camus was a tad pretentious in dividing the work into five parts, emulating or evoking the five acts of classical tragedy. And as a matter of personal philosophical outlook, I disagree with Camus when he implies that life itself is an oppression or pestilence. But those quibbles really are nit-picks.A final word of advice: For those who have never read THE PLAGUE, or have not read it in quite a while, I strongly urge first reading \\"The Stranger\\" (which can be done in just a few hours). Both novels raise the dilemma of how man goes on in the modern post-Nietzschean world without God. In \\"The Stranger\\", the solution is found within the individual, in the context of solitude. In THE PLAGUE -- five years later and after Camus's involvement with the Resistance - the solution is found through interpersonal involvement and love, in the context of human solidarity. Camus himself, in a letter to Roland Barthes, characterized the evolution between the two novels as one from solitude to solidarity."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"My copy of THE PLAGUE is part of the Everyman's Library of Camus's work. The introduction of this great volume is written by David Bellos, who makes the following comments about this grim masterpiece:\\"THE PLAGUE is most easily approached as a parable about the German Occupation of France. The \`state of siege' under which the residents of Oran are put is easily decoded as the situation of a subject population under foreign military rule.\\"\\"THE PLAGUE, for all its manifest encoding of the very recent past, is best read as a parable of a more general kind. It is a novel not so much about the Nazi Occupation, as about occupation, oppression, isolation and trial. It shows what it means to resist, not just a foreign invader, but incomprehensible evil in whatever form it many manifest itself. And it says: good men--just men--do what they can, and they can do a great deal.\\"\\"The absence of \`ultimate' meaning was felt by Camus, and by millions of people of his generation, as a palpable gap, as an emotional void in the place previously occupied by religious faith... The best way to cope with [this] absurdity, Camus argues, is to treat it with contempt, by behaving as if every aspect of human life really mattered.\\"\\"THE PLAGUE... is therefore a novel of vague but persuasive optimism about the possibility for achieving a meaningful life in the struggle against the incomprehensible and the oppressive.\\"I add that Camus's pacing and his gradual accumulation of telling and dire detail makes much of THE PLAGUE read like a first-rate thriller. And, Bravo! to the characters Reiux, Tarrou, Rambert, and Grand, who transform simple conscientious decency into a form of heroism.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"I found this book to be a rich account of human nature, and his struggle for meaning... and an interesting ethical text questioning the relation of goodness and religion. I understand that some find this a slow-paced, dark read but after reading The Stranger, witnessing Camus' main characters reach for hope in friendship and solidarity in this novel is almost refreshing. And it is well worth reading for the masterful character study alone."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"In the 21st century we expect to control and conquer disease. How can we imagine the horror ofThe Plague? Albert Camus gave us a chilling story, set in the Algerian city of Oran. First the rats bleed and die, and then people begin to fall sick with the dreaded bubonic plague. As the weekly death toll rises, officials seal off the city and the long exile begins.The hospitals fill up and public buildings are requisitioned for makeshift plague wards. Quarantine camps are established. The usual burial arrangements are inadequate so the corpses are eventually interred in communal graves without the presence of mourners.The narrator is unnamed until the end. The central character is Dr. Rieux who goes about his rounds of caring and organizing, somehow able to carry on in the absurd atmosphere of death, exile, deprivation and bereavement. \\"There lay certitude, there in the daily round...The thing was to do your job as it should be done.\\"The other characters find their own way of carrying on -- the civil servant in pursuit of the perfect opening sentence for his book, the priest preaching God's flail of retribution, the journalist on assignment when the city is was sealed and now frantic to escape to his wife, the fearful criminal living for the first time in a community of fear, the vacationer sharing his passion for collective responsibility with Dr. Rieux one starry night.Of courseThe Plagueis about an epidemic only on its most superficial level. Camus, Algerian-born himself, was a committed anti-totalitarian fresh from the French Resistance in 1947 when THE PLAGUE was published. His characters act out his personal philosophy in the absurdist 1940s world: they keep doing the right thing while believing that it won't make a difference, while knowing that to do anything else is to be complicit in the wickedness of the world. The book is easy to read but much more challenging to think about, which makes a good case for the reading.Linda Bulger, 2008"},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"This is one of the easier reads from Camus and it is a straightforward story. It was published in 1947 after Camus's basic ideas on religion, life, and the absurd had been formed. The novel brings forth Camus's ideas on the absurd, and the revolt against a world of the absurd and of injustice. The plagues is an event that tests man's reaction to the crisis, and the city and the plague are literary vehicles used by Camus to describe human reactions.Albert Camus (1913 - 1960) was a French writer and philosopher. He is often associated with existentialism, but Camus rejected any ideological classification. Camus was a young recipient of the Nobel Prize for Literature when he became the first African-born writer to receive the award in 1957. He died in a car crash only three years after receiving the award. He was a social activist and Communist, and fought with the French resistance in WWII. Later he rejected Communism. The present book is one of his last works.Camus combined his philosophy with his writing skills to produce literary art. The end result is sometimes complicated. It takes a close and careful examination to see exactly what points he is trying to make. For example, Camus descibed his novel The Stranger as a story about someone who was telling the unvarnished truth, but it was more complicated than simply that.For The Plague, he has created a relatively simple story about a plague that grips the Algerian city of Oran brought on by a disease carried by rats. It is a narrative by a doctor Rieux who treats the sick and deals with the survivors.Camus's ideas can be found in the non-fiction work The Myth of Sisyphus (Le Mythe de Sisyphe) (1942): it is about \\"the absurd sensitivity.\\" That idea is continued here in The Plague. We cannot conclude that Camus \\"found religion\\" in the present work nor are there any changes in Camus's philosophy. There are a number of interesting characters in Ther Plague who are used by Camus to make his point. One such character is a priest. A controversey surrounds the priest because he calls for a simple choice: total acceptance or rejection of religion.Overall, this is a good book from Camus that takes only four or five hours to read and is relatively easy to understand. It is far less complicated than The Fall, and it is straighforward to read and understand similar to The Stranger. It is less philosphical than some of his other books and a few ideas are subtle.This is one instance, similar to The Fall by Camus, where you should look beyond the reviews here to get a deeper understanding of the work; and, it is probably best to read some of the detailed analysis found elswhere in critical books or on the net."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"When an outbreak of the Bubonic Plague occurs in a fictional French colonial port city in 1940s Algeria, its inhabitants are coalesced into a collective existence, one where despair displaces hope and death permeates the very core of their existence. But worse than the aura of death is the prison atmosphere of the city, for all its denizens are cut off from the outside world. In this supreme isolation, the citizens are separated from their loved ones and live their days in a futile, meaningless manner.Death is treated as having no moral value. There is no martyrdom or purpose in death, it is just a natural occurrence that we will inevitably succumb to. Death takes the lives of young and old, rich and poor, wicked and saintly, without regard to the merits of those lives it takes. Indeed, any rebellion or fight against Death is ultimately futile. Tarrou fought death, while Father Paneloux did not resist it, but they both met the same fate.Another aspect of \\"The Plague\\" is the inefficiencies and inadequacies of the colonial government. The first reaction of the government is to deny that there is a plague, and then to repress information. Although Dr. Rieux, the character's narrator, pleads with the government to take drastic actions to stem the outbreak of an epidemic, his pleas go unanswered. It is only after the epidemic has spiraled out of control, that the government executes a plan to control it. However, they can never really expunge the plague from their city, for the plague dies naturally after many months.This existentialist novel is narrated in a dry, detached tone by Dr. Rieux, who claims to be an impartial witness to all of those who suffered. This makes it a somewhat tedious read, especially when Rieux summarizes the diaries of Tarrou. Most of the action takes place by a third person account and the narrative can be dry and tedious at times.However, \\"The Plague\\" is certainly worthy of your time, for it presents deep questions about death and the meaning of life. Even after you have finished reading this novel, its questions, and lack of answers, remain for us to ponder."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"Few authors can deliver such a strong philosophical message through the form of a novel as Camus did with The Plague. Those who appreciated this level may also find Dostoevsky's The Brothers Karamazov to have a similar effect. The Norton Critical Edition with the C. Garnett trans. (ISBN 0393092143) is especially comprehensive.Susan Neiman's Evil in Modern Thought (ISBN 0691117926) is a great companion to either of these works, as it confronts in particular the subject of evil in the context of history, philosophy, and such literature as these works represent."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"The suggestion that Camus's classic is as timely as it is timeless is not an expression to be taken glibly. At its core, The Plague is as much a tale of hope as it is about death. Amid its stark and grim descriptions of despair, lies the rediscovery of common purpose, of brotherhood, sacrifice, and above all, life. Yet, there is nothing in this story of redemption to imply a pivot of righteousness or god-willed forgiveness. No, the veritable truth of this account is the reconciliation of those uncontrollable forces that commandeer us, nature, God, death with those whimsical, human impulses that define us, love, desire, fear. In the end it is to guide us towards understanding significance and belief, both of our individual and collective selves, in the worlds that we create and that create us.The story unfurls by recounting a morning like any other morning in the sleepy and listless town of Oran. Yet, this seemingly unconvential day is marked with the odd profusion of dead rats within the city. The harbinger of doom symbolized by these rodent corpses quickly turns from peculiarity to dread, and Camus's masterful reportorial passages landscape the cloud of panic and fear that literally and figuratively quarantine the town. At once both detailed and grandiose, Camus never loses focuses on his objectivity. His phrases are almost scientific when describing the physical ravages of the disease, and his honest and austere portraits of the psychology manifestations of Oran always retain the precision of the conscientious observer. Yet, even while constructing the setting with an eye of distance, Camus brilliantly juxtaposes them against his vivid character studies, ones that radiate their unflinching and, in many ways, life-sustaining humanity. From the devastating dedication of Dr. Rieux to the monumental heroism of the tongue-tied Grand, each individual materializes the many facets of morality and courage that emerge in the face of dire adversity. It is in these depictions that Camus's passion and pain thrive-tinted with the weight of his existential musings, these archetypes (as each can be reduced to an element of complete ethical composition) are men caught within a God-fearing, but Godless world, where their only respite is alleviation. In perhaps the most powerful soliloquy on compassion, guilt, and justice that I have ever read, Tarrou illuminates the plight of the &quot;plague-stricken,&quot; of which we are all a part, and must somehow escape. It is an absolutely heart-wrenching and beautiful passage; the most sublime in a book replete with them.Much more can be said about the uncompromising splendor of this novel-it is epic, in the most profound of ways, through its encapsulation of the ways in which we struggle and survive. Relevant for all ages, but conspicuously for ours, where empathy and understanding disappear regularly from our conscience, this is a living testament of perseverance. That truth is not beautiful, that pain will always be linked to us, these are our realities-but we cannot lose hope and balance in the face of them."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"I am re-reading this book after studying this in high school many years ago. Back then, I was told that this book described human philosphical struggle against a meaningless universe. Be that as it may, I find this book even more intriguing as we start to deal with the SARS epidemics (April 2003). The similarity between the epidemics described in Camus' book and the Asian SARS epidemics is striking, particularly people's reaction to the crisis. No need to intelluctualize the story and call it a poliltical or philosphical allegory. This book is even more disturbing when it is read as a literal (fictional) documentory."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"Compared to The Outsider, The Plague is a very beautiful novel about life. All the important questions about life and death are asked in The Plague, although they are not answered so readily. The Plague is deeply moving and will make you question your own life and values. The Outsider also asks the big questions, but The Plague handles them with beauty and sadness. A wonderful book to read."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"This was an attempt to find meaning in life, which so many authors, and others, have struggled with since we started walking on two feet. Is there any change from one generation to another, or from one time to another, or from one place to another? Camus believes not. He doesn't see a moral advancement of humanity, but a stagnant slog through what chance puts in front of us.Reading this book, I had the feeling that I was going through the feelings of those poor souls in Oran. I was sharing with them first denial, then anger, then acceptance, then resignation, and finally, joy. If not joy, then at least relief. But the plague can come again, on a whim.I imagine that the novel is a statement of the uncertainties that we find ourselves in all the time, and how little we can do about it. There is no divine force guiding us, or anyone else, We have to find our own way, whether it is through helping people, or not helping people, through what is considered legitimate, or what is illegitimate actions. There are no moral statements in the book, just acceptance of the various forces acting upon us, through us, and by us.This book, through the various and opposing characters it paints trying to come to grips with this calamity, accomplishes its aim. Be prepared to think about its meaning well after reading the last page. Think about its relevance whenever external forces overpower us, as they do all the time, whether natural, or through the actions of mankind."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"This is a fantastic book and there's a lot to be said about it, but I'm writing simply in response to the review (and, I think, a pervasive belief) that The Plague is basically an elaboration/expansion on The Stranger. This is flatly untrue: The Stranger espouses individual integrity and The Plague espouses social solidarity. A fairly clear proof of this is that the protagonist of The Plague is a doctor while the protagonist of The Stranger is a murderer. I think that, once Camus had formalized his theories of the absurd in Myth of Sisyphus and The Stranger, he observed and considered their implications on actual life in modern society. Such consideration was unavoidably catalyzed by his life under German occupation in World War II (which Camus said was the basis for the idea of the plague). The basis of ideas--humans confronted with a strange and Godless universe, unaided by obsolete systems of ethics--is the same, but the conclusion is different: people can only forge new morality in conjunction with other human beings, and only by aiding each insofar as each is capable.Also, it is worth saying that The Plague is, on a literary level, a really good book: it has good drama (the first plague death, the ominous atmosphere of the first rat), comedy (the old man whose goals is to live to an extremely protracted age and looks forward to watching the riots; Grand's novel), and poignancy (Grand's note to Jean, Rambert's strengthening of heart)."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"Whether you are interested in a compelling story or an existential fable, the Plague is one of the most important fictional works of the century. More profound than the Stranger, because it presents the dilemma of the protagonist in a very different way. In the Stranger, the dilemma is that you've got to make choices, and whether you choose or don't you've made a choice, and the stranger alternates between evasion and arbitrariness until he discovers, almost too late (when his choices are confined to the limits of a prison cell) that choice matters. In the Plague, the issue is that there is no final exit: all you can say for sure is that here you are, quarantined on the earth (as the characters are quarantined in their village). Nothing you do may ultimately matter, and no one is going to come from outside to solve your problems. In spite of this, the hero finds reasons to go on living, to improve the lives of a few in small ways. It's worth comparing this novel to Saramago's \\"Blindness\\" -- the latter is perhaps more inventive in its style, but I find the Plague a more ultimately satisfying novel. There is nothing extraneous here."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"Camus' THE PLAGUE should make it obvious that Camus was a writer first and an existentialist a very distant second. (In fact, when you read his essays and notebooks, he's probably a critic second and an existentialist an even more distant third.)Set in Oran, the efficient pestilence that is wiping out the population forces the characters to examine their pasts and their present lives. And Camus does a fascinating job of making these characters both real and sympathetic. The novel is also full of stunning images: the frothing rats, the old man brushing his cat while Death looms all around, etc. No, there is not much action in this book but the suspense is nonetheless palpable as you wonder who will be next to succumb.Camus has too often been lumped together with Jean Paul Sartre, and I think this is erroneous. Camus had a belief in the human spirit. While there may be a &quot;benign indifference of the sky&quot; (The Stranger) over all of us, he is not indifferent to what happens in our hearts and minds, and this is what gives human life its worth."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"A book that watches a city's population slowly die of a plague will never be an uplifting book. Other reviewers have suggested that this book gives a glimpse into a dying man's soul. At least to analyze the surface, one can analyze the book as a city's reactions when they are quarantined for a period of plague.Readers may find the book difficult to follow as the perspective of the story changes often. It is not until the last chapter that we discover the narrator. As the book begins with rats dying, people deny the existence of a problem. Even as people begin to die, the denial continues. As the bureaucrats decide if a problem exists, people die in greater quantities. This is the expected shot at an unfeeling bureaucracy that one expects from Camus. As a plague is recognized, the people must make unpopular sacrifices and decisions. While one might not expect the entire town to die out, the morbid nature of the story leaves some doubt in the readers mind.Many reviewers give this book lofty praise, calling it one of the best books ever written. In truth, I do not even think it is the best book by Camus. I prefer \\"The Stranger\\". Yet I respect that each has his/her own tastes."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"THE PLAGUE by Albert Camus is one of the most gripping, thought provoking novels to emerge from the aftermath of the Second World War. It tells of the bubonic plague breaking out in Oran, in Algeria, with thousands dying daily for months on end. Eventually, after heroic efforts by the city government, the plague begins to abate, and the survivors bury the dead and try to make sense out of what seems like an undirected thunderbolt from a vengeful god. On just this level, THE PLAGUE carries the reader along with its realistic depiction of first the fraying and then the snapping of the tenuous strands that bind a civilized society. But this is Camus writing, a man whose novels and plays always suggest more than they say. THE PLAGUE lends itself to allegory, in which the totality of the surface story covers a hidden one. In this case, given that western civilization had come THISCLOSE to annihilation by the German Nazis, the allegory could safely point to a world conflagration that had ended just two years prior to the book's publication. Just as the Nazis had hidden beneath the legitimate German government of the 1920s before emerging to overwhelm Europe with death and destruction one decade later, so do the rats wait in their lairs, secretly multiplying, waiting for the day to leave their lairs to spread their disease, announcing to a disbelieving world that the nightmare has already begun.Bernard Rieux is a doctor who sees his city come apart at the seams, but has no effective means to stop the plague. He administers a drug that is very nearly futile. All that he can do is to make a difference, even to one patient. Of course, he cannot, and this is precisely Camus' point. In a world gone mad where absurdities become the norm, there is the tendency to throw in the towel and meekly accept one's fate. This Rieux refuses to do. As he goes about his business as a doctor, his patients die left and right, but his presence in the front lines create meaning to what seems truly an apocalypse with no meaning. If he cannot offer an effective antidote, he does the next best thing: he dispenses hope, thereby impressing his own meaning. Others are equally trapped in the city, some of whom have no responsibility to help. Raymond Rambert is one such. He is a journalist who at first seeks to escape from a city whose problems he does not equate with his own. He tries to escape, but when escape is impossible, he too creates meaning in his fierce determination to do something, anything, to help. Others, still, act less nobly, but as Camus makes clear that in times of near universal crisis, men tend to act according to their natures, THE PLAGUE suggests that in times of such crises, each man will judge how he wishes to act, and the world will be made a bit better--or worse--by that."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"In \\"The Plague,\\" the players have a more human face than \\"The Stranger.\\" The plague is sometimes seen as a metaphor for Nazi occupation. This perhaps most evident when the plague's end is described by the narrator as liberation.The priest Paneloux preaches that the plague is God's response to man's wickedness, but as the narrator says, \\"To some the sermon simply brought home the fact that they had been sentenced, for an unknow crime, to an indeterminate period of punishment.\\" Echoes of Kafka's \\"The Trial.\\"The narrator quotes from Tarrou's journal: \\"Query: How contrive not to waste one's time? Answer: By being fully aware of it all the while. Ways in which this can be done: By spending one's days on any uneasy chair in a dentist's waiting-room; by remaining on one's balcony all of a Sunday afternoon; by listening to lectures in a language one doesn't know; by traveling by the longest and least-convenient train routes, and of course standing all the way; by lining up at the box-office of theaters and then not buy a seat; and so forth.\\" A philosophy echoed by Dunbar in Joseph Heller's \\"Catch-22.\\"There are echoes of Sisyphus here. There is Grand (who is anything but) constantly rewriting the first and only line of a novel he is working on. There is Doctor Rieux's response to Tarrou's \\"Only, I now can picture what this plague must mean for you\\" -- \\"Yes. A never ending defeat.\\"There is Tarrou's explaining to Dr. Rieux his revulsion at capital punishment and later at the left's embracing murder for its own ends. Echoing Camus' split with Sartre and the left.There is much food for thought here."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"Camus' The Plague is at once disturbing in detail and beautiful in content. Camus strips away the self-righteous facades of contrived morality and displays its true character: idiosyncratic, open, nonpresumptuous nakedness. As we read The Plague, we follow the struggles of a doctor who is tasked to heal the unhealable. The reasons he gives, as well as the reasons that all characters give, for his quiet heroism are simple, and by virtue of its simplicity, reaffirms the difficulty we all face in making moral decisions. Sad, inspiring, disturbing, and subtle, The Plague is the story of humankind naked, groping its way through human tragedy. And in the valiant attempt to save the townspeople, Camus essentially saves us all."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"My first read of this book a few years ago had left me with the impression that it made for a sordid case of existential disenchantment.Camus to me was the hero of life's pointlessness, the murky messenger of resistance and its impossibility, the contemporary writer who proved that life was a plague and its victims were condemned to an endless cycle of futile revolt.On the second read, however, the book is nowhere near as despondent as I recall it. Far from it.It is about courage, about engagement, about paltriness and generosity, about small heroism and large cowardice, and about all kinds of profoundly humanist problems, such as love and goodness, happiness and mutual connection. It weaves a complex hope offered by resistance and the urgency of understanding the long, deep reach of war's corrupting power.A very, very satisfying and thought provoking read."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"I emerged from this book as one baptised in the cogent waters of a formidable intellect. Camus' masterpiece remains an astonishingly moving work even today, despite the half century that has passed since it was published. The story of a highly contagious plague which sweeps through the small north African town of Oran in an unspecified year in the 40's is an intrinsically human document, a social, philosophical and psychological study dealing with exile, seperation, love and bereavment, yet all delivered in the most objective of fashions. While the book can be enjoyed as a straightforward (and harrowing) narrative, the status of the plague as a metaphorical device is easily recognisable to the reader, although which specific comparison Camus wishes to make is perhaps less apparent: the reader can attempt to guess, or indeed assign whichever they themselves see as most fitting. None of the power of the novel is lost due to this fact. While the scale of the sheer loss of life the plague engenders is constantly made clear to us, the novel centres around a group of friends, all male, who are thrown together by grace of the plague itself. This group of people from all walks of life function as a cross section of the plague's effects on society, especially after Oran is quarantined and hence shut off from the outside world. I found the anecdotal structure dealing with the misadventures of Rieux, Tarrou et al to be one of the novels greatest strenghths, particularly when one witnesses the fragile and delightful friendships which burgeon between the protagonists and each characters own peculiar strategies for dealing with the horrifying situation in which they find themselves. Love, perhaps the most powerful of human emotions, has a particularly unique representation in the book, as much of the novel is spent in the depths of seperation, inaugurating a particularly objective viewpoint of love and its connotations. The grim inevitability of death makes the novel as a whole rather a morbidly fascinating yet inherently horrifying journey, and some scenes (such as the agonisingly slow death of a plague stricken child) are genuinely shocking. Despite this, Camus depicts the nobility of human spirit, particularly in times of crisis, with astonishing ease and grace. I found myself questioning the values by which I, indeeed all of us, live after finishing the book, and although Camus paints a chilling picture he does afford us a final message of hope which is very gratifying.As a social study and telling look at the behaviour of humanity, this book is invaluable. Camus delivers myriad messages, yet it is scenes like that involving a moonlight swim or a plethora of dying rats that, I feel, will never leave my mind.Hugely recommended to anyone with a modicum of intellect, or indeed those who enjoy a yarn with all the facets of a classic story: love, death, tragedy and hope."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"As expected, Camus gives us a timeless book with many poignant scenes that leave the reader with many frightening realizations. Though Camus claims to not be an existentialist (instead, a godless Christian), Many of the themes used in this book parallel with the beliefs that make up the foundation of existentialist thinking, such as the issue odf alienation, nothingness, despair, and of course, the absurdity of death. Camus leaves us with a killer last line, that is just as powerful as the last line of The Stranger. What is it, you may ask? Well, you will have to find out on your own. A very profound book; Camus ceases to amaze to this day."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"Resisting the existential deification of unlimited subjectivity, Camus presented his great faith in innate human goodness never more greatly than in this novel. It is a triumph of the human conscience over a dark era of tragedy and broken values."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"_The Plague_ is probably a bit misrepresented in today's morbid society: It is not a dark, demented book about a town that loses its mind. Camus gives us a taste of bubonic plague in a shipping town and then shows how the city reacts. We have interesting insights into the doctors, the politicians, the criminal element who smuggle well people out before they can get the plague, and the bourgeouis reaction. Camus sets it up in a style that to me seems rather reminiscent of Kafka's _The Castle_ where you're never completely sure of what's going on.If the novel has a failing, it is in the characters. Few of them really come to life, rather seeming manipulated by their situations. Still, it's a novel that will keep you thinking, and deserves its classic status."}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:S},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:W,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},z={class:"card-container"},D=["disabled"],H={key:0},x={key:1};function P(n,o,s,u,r,i){const c=m("PoemCard");return e(),t("section",null,[o[1]||(o[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),a("div",z,[(e(!0),t(g,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(h,f)=>(e(),w(c,{key:f,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(e(),t("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:o[0]||(o[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(e(),t("span",x,"Loading...")):(e(),t("span",H,"See more"))],8,D)):p("",!0)])}const q=d(B,[["render",P],["__scopeId","data-v-d3068ea4"]]),E=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"guide/62.md","filePath":"guide/62.md"}'),C={name:"guide/62.md"},N=Object.assign(C,{setup(n){return(o,s)=>(e(),t("div",null,[b(q)]))}});export{E as __pageData,N as default};
