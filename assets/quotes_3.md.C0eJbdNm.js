Dawn, on the other hand, seemed to forget about that situation until Phillip showed up in her bedroom. Otherwise, the book was great, and I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"Having not read V.C. Andrew's books for over four years, I decided to pick up Dawn at a used books store--for the heck of it. I wanted to see why I liked it so much during middle school. I now know why I stopped reading her books. It's soo mind warping! Although the stories are interesting, they're disgusting and fake. Dawn makes incestuous thoughts, sex at 15, and perverted touching okay...that's just messed up. I think I liked it more during middle school because of my curiosity with the opposite sex and my naiveness of great novels. Since I'm more matured, the books now appall me. I was going to give Dawn 1 star, however the plot was interesting and I've read worse. Overall, I wouldn't highly recommend the book, unless you have nothing else to read, and if you do read it be prepared to have your morals and values questioned."},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"I admit I liked this book a lot when I was in my early teens, because of its suspenseful plot and its many sexual scenes. Fortunately, real life has never been like this for anyone. This book is about rape, incest, cruelty, betrayal, stupidity, and a host of other topics I would rather not even think about, much less read about. The main character is so stupid, it's hard to sympathize with her very much, and none of the other characters are worth two cents either. All of them are flat stereotypes. Be careful; this stuff will burn up your mind if you let it. But at least now I know how to identify truly horrid literature! This book has served a purpose after all."},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"I am not trying to offend anyone here, but by far Dawn is only appealing to people that have never really read a good book in their lives. On whole it was extremly stupid. People just do not fall in love with their 'supoposed' sibblings. As well as the fact that Dawn herself was extremly weak, petti and annoying. I.E. ''I filled out my sweater better!!!'' &quot;Was it a crime to like my blonde hair and blue eyes?'' Their was a point in the novel were Dawn not only thought herself half bad looking or immaculate beyond human belief, she unfortunatley also believed that no one was a smidge on her. Comments such as: &quot;She had dull brown eyes&quot; Managed to achieve nothing but offend. As far as I and another of my friends are concerned Dawn was a weak, vain, dull looking little priss who's life was meaningless.. And on whole the characters were unrealistic, hollow and simply, I am afraid to say the whole book was an utter shock after reading stories that ent! ertained readers beyond belief. This includes the Dollanganger and Casteel previous to this book. Now that was what you call writing...Dawn, a no hopers tale."},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"Dawn was a weak and woefull tale of a vain and prissy little bimbo. I.E. ''I filled my sweater better!!'' ''Was it a crime to like my blonde hair and blue eyes?'' This vainess posessed by Dawn was beyond like. It was to the point were she was willing to cut off her stupid hair and frame it for every one in the world to see.The plot was stupid because it concentrated too much around one particular thing. One highly unrealistic and pethetic thing I might add. Other characters in the novel were far to obsessed with the leading lady (The inspirational Dawn) this included people that really shouldn't have been, as well as people that were highly unrealistic in every way.This book is very, very annoying..Short and sweet. Dawn the story of a worthless try hard and her try hard friends and family.You really stuffed up V.C. Andrews."},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"All right, if I'd had my way, there would be no star above. This was a waste of my time, energy and the dollar fifty I paid for it. In fact, if I had gotten it for free, it still would have been a waste. Dawn is nothing more than a pretentious journey through some hicks pretentious life, her incestuous brother and her general stupidity (ie: blonde hair). Really, if you like wasting your time, your money, your energy . . . and your life, read this. Otherwise, burn it."},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"This was the first book of the V.C.

All of V.C Andrews's characters seem to be so much alike, they're always beautiful, strong and determined and they usally always get hurt in so many ways. Also all of her books seem to have something in commmon, incest, forbidden loves, and family love.

I consider reading this book, its great!"},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"WOW! I love this series! Its great even though from what I have heard it has been written by the GW. I made the mistake of buying the books 1 by 1!! Becuase it was so good i kept bugging my mom to take me to buy the next one it kept me up all night reading! Great series! The GW really outdid themselves! I was begining to think that this was really by V.C. Andrews herself! A must read! One of the best series in my opinion"},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"Dawn's life is turned upside down when she discovers her parents were keeping secrets and have been on the run (without spoiling things, these *parents* are candidates for the biggest pair of dumb*sses ever in a fictional novel). Now she's forced to live with people who resent her and treat her to cruelty piled upon cruelty. To add to the angst, she's also all mixed up inside sexually about the two boys' in her life. Jimmy was raised as her brother and Philip (her boyfriend with the groping paws) who she recently discovers *is* her brother. Ehhh, what a dilemma!I have to admit that I was absolutely riveted to this story while reading despite all of its over-the-top drama and other assorted flaws. Four stars for the keeping-my-attention factor."},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"After reading the Dollanganger and Casteel books, I pretty much knew what to expect from V. C. Andrews' third series (the Cutler family series). A lot of her stories deal with the rags-to-riches theme, and in \\"Dawn\\", the leading 14-year-old character (Dawn Longchamp) learns that her current impoverished family (which consists of an older brother, Jimmy, a baby sister, Fern, and parents) is not really her own. Dawn is really the daughter of a wealthy family in Richmond, Virginia, who own and operate a prestigious hotel on the coast named Cutler's Cove Hotel. As if that weren't shocking enough, Dawn soon discovers that two of her classmates (Clara Sue and Philip) at Emerson Peabody School are really her siblings--and Philip also happens to be Dawn's boyfriend. The chances of that actually happening are about a million to one, but the taboo of incest is in all of V. C. Andrews' books, whether it's plausible or not.Following the revealed secrets, comes the emotional, psychological, and sexual abuse. Dawn is returned to her \\"rightful\\" family, and she is immediately disliked by her sister Clara Sue, as well as her matriarchal grandmother. Philip, on the other hand, refuses to allow their relation to get in the way of his scoring with her. In the background are Dawn's biological parents, both of whom are pretty delinquent and submit under Grandmother Cutler's command. The only security Dawn has comes from her other \\"brother\\" Jimmy, who later expresses his years of restrained feelings for her, which she reciprocates. (Jeez, if it's not one brother, it's the next.)Even though this book (and series) is pretty good, it's not the most original storyline in the world, nor is Dawn Longchamp-Cutler the greatest heroine I've ever read in a V. C. Andrews book. The ghostwriter (Andrew Neiderman) relies too much on the redundant family drama Ms. Andrews outlined before she died; you can pretty much deduce the surprises laying ahead for the character. Nevertheless, I still find myself drawn to these books. No matter how bad your family life may be (speaking within reason), you can always read a V. C. Andrews book and say, \\"I'm glad I'm not in her shoes.\\"After \\"Dawn\\" comes \\"Secrets of the Morning\\", \\"Twilight's Child\\", \\"Midnight Whispers\\", and \\"Darkest Hour\\". Recommended for V. C. Andrews fans."},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"Once I read &quot;Dawn&quot; I thought this is the most amazing writer I have ever read from and when I realized the writer wrote the movie &quot;Flowers in the Attic&quot; that I loved for as long as I could remember I fell in love with anything else she wrote.

I knew what was going to happen to Dawn from the first chapter on to the last. It was so predictable, i.e long lost rich family, incest, a grandmother who hates her, and a weak mother and father. Before it was &quot;revealed&quot; I knew she was dating her brother. I also knew her brother was going to still want to carry on their relationship. And the sister hating her, now that was a stretch of the imagination, NOT! This story was so predictable, maybe because the Andrews family won't let the writers stray to far V.C. Andrews original Flowers in the Attic series."},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"DAWN(actually the whole Cutler series) was one of the weakest novels by the author, which I attribute to the ghost writer's &quot;settling into the original author's style&quot;. Many events that took place in the book were exactly the same as those in HEAVEN and FLOWERS IN THE ATTIC. I would _not_ recommend DAWN to someone who has never read any of V.C. Andrews novels. However, the novel still had enough originality to keep die hard Andrews fans interested, as well as regular fans. Overall, DAWN had some disappointments, yet the book is still worth a good day's read."},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"I have a few problems with the storytelling of \\"Dawn.\\" First, I've read this book a few times over the years, and I've never quite been able to become a Dawn/Jimmy fan. I just can't get over how quickly she forgot that he was her big brother her entire life until she found out the truth at age fifteen!! And then, she was able to get over Philip as soon as her feet landed on the polished wood floor of Cutler's Cove Hotel. Unbelievable. By the end of the book, she has convinced Jimmy that she can have real feeling of passion for him. I might have been able to climb on board, if it hadn't all happened so quickly. And why can't Philip, the most popular, handsome boy in school get over Dawn? I'm sure he's dated prettier girls before. Please. I gave this book 3 stars because I enjoy the story, I just cannot get into Dawn and Jimmy's romance. And not to mention the weirdness of Grandmother Cutler, who obviously hates Dawn...why does she insist that Dawn be renamed Eugenia, after her beloved little sister? And why was Dawn named that in the first place? It just doesn't make sense to me."},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"After VC Andrews died, it was left to Andrew Neiderman to finish the four books she had started but did not finish. After he did so, he wrote this book. It is supposed to have been based off notes and outlines left by VC before her untimely death. I know that some people were unhappy with Neiderman for this book and series, but I feel that the Cutler series reflected Neiderman's best efforts. It's clear that he put a lot of effort into this series as compared to his later works... which consist of pretty much anything he did after the Logan series especially Daughter of Darkness and the Gemini, Attic Secrets, April Shadows, Broken Flower, and Heavenstone series.This series was very decent, and I feel that VCA herself would have been pleased with this story though I am sure she would have tweaked it to add more of her personal, inimitable style. If you want to keep reading VCA and have read the Dollanganger and Casteel series, then read this, along with the Landry series. Together, these series make for a good reading experience whether it be from the original author or ghostwriter.Though this book itself leaves a lot of unanswered questions, it is but the first book of five, so you get to explore Dawn's story further (and the deal with Grandmother Cutler) The situations with her real and adopted brother bring a good touch of Gothic and incest to make the series thrilling enough."},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"This book was important for me to read, because it followed Darkest Hour, but all that incest of made me sick!!! Also, Clara Sue isn't even showing her sexy self! Nothing wrong with a little chubbiness!!!!!I really thought that Lillian was going to be THAT sexy blonde MISS AMERICA? Instead she had gone soft... Well with those gorgeous blonde locks turning into a short curl, not the mention her girly ho blue eyes have gone grey, and her sex appeal has lef the building! I HATED GRANDMERE! I miss my GLAMer!Frankly I didn't know how Dawn -as I read on a little birdie told me that she was supposed to be madam of- would inherit the HO (I won't tel)?! Love this book, it left so much to be told?!!!"},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"Every one in our household enjoys these wonderful books by V.C. Andrews. They are very interesting and always a thrill to read."},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"Let me say that this novel is what got me into reading V.C. Andrews in the first place, though the details of the Cutler series never stuck out in my mind like \\"Flowers in the Attic\\" or \\"Petals on the Wind\\", or the Casteel or Landry series. As for \\"My Sweet Audrina\\", though the story was refreshingly original, I just never connected with the characters like I connected with Catherine Leigh Dollanganger, my favorite V.C. heroine because of her strength and passion. I read the first three Dawn books in three days, I couldn't put them down, I was so drawn into the story, and that is worth a lot.However, what hurt this book is Dawn falling in love with Jimmy (and he with her), who she knew as her brother for the first fifteen years of her life, and the way she was able to just turn off her less than sisterly feelings for Philip just like that didn't make a whole lot of sense either. That kind of thing takes time and even then, especially if you've already been intimate (even if you haven't gone all the way), I don't know if those feelings ever really go away, even if you fall in love with someone else. Actually, I think Jimmy and Dawn getting together is actually weirder than her and Philip getting together, even if they were blood-related. Heaven's story was more believable, in that the boy, Tom, she had loved as her brother, she still loved as her brother, even after she found out they weren't blood-related; and her uncle Troy, with whom she had not only slept with, but already fallen in love with, she loved that way still, even if it is supposedly wrong (I am not sure if there is anything in the Bible about uncles not being able to marry nieces--I have heard it's only wrong if it's aunts marrying nephews, but I'm not sure). I agree with Corinne Foxworth Dollanganger (Cathy's mother from \\"Flowers in the Attic\\") that a lot of rules are man-made, for she and her half-uncle (really her half-brother, as you later find out) married in a church. But I digress.Yes, Jimmy having always wished that Dawn was too pretty to be his sister was much creepier to me than Philip's obsession with her.I've usually found the heroine's love interests in these novels attractive, and though Jimmy was a great guy (not to mention in uniform for awhile), I couldn't get past the stupid name of Jimmy Longchamp. I like James, but that last name needed to go.I think this story was set (at the beginning) in 1978, and were Southern aristocrats really this obsessed with going by first and middle names? I thought it was a bit over the top. They acted like Dawn No-Middle-Name was a weird name. Maybe the GW just had too much fun with names. Authors tend to go overboard with naming their characters sometimes.I did cringe at the description of Laura Sue (a pretty, useless thing, and Dawn's natural mother) as resembling a Dresden doll, and some of the metaphors to the themed titles sounded a bit silly (though I was so into the story, I don't have any examples).I think there are twins in the first five V.C. series (two in the Dollanganger saga and two in the Landry series: Ruby and Gisselle, and Ruby's sons, Jean and Pierre), save the Casteel (though don't quote me on that), which averages over a set of twins per series! I know the GW was trying to copy V.C.'s style, and there's nothing wrong with trying to emulate (for the sake of continuing her legacy, but don't copy!). There have already been two evil Grandmother Olivias, and whereas there was the grandmother Jillian in the Casteel series, there was Lillian in this one. I'm not really complaining about the similarities, as long as the GW gives each character their own voice and personality, but he didn't give Dawn much of a personality (he gave it all to Clara Sue). Now Cathy had a personality!Another similarity is that all the women (save Heaven), have an artistic talent. Out of all the series, the Dollanganger and the Casteel series were the most original and I think that's because they are probably the only two that were the original ideas of V.C. (even though I think she died before finishing the Casteel series).So, even though there are a lot of similarities (and Fern's character added nothing to this series), it is still well worth the time and money I spent on it."},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"I read this book a year ago and did not enjoy it. However I recently read it again and I loved it. Throughout the whole book I felt so sorry for Dawn. She had to deal with fitting into a ritzy private school, and then fitting into another family. Her Grandmother was absolutely horrible to her, as was Clara Sue. I hated Philip for what he did to her. By the end of the book things began to work out for her and she was able to get away from her terrible family. This book is worth reading a second time."},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"I LOVE this book and think it's great, but PLEASE.... will someone email me with the titles of the books in the Cutler series? I don't know them and I want to read them ALL!Thanks!"},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"I think that this book was a very interesting book and it is worth reading.

It's very mysterious and you want to keep on reading until the end. When you put the book down you start imagining what is going to happen next. I would read it again, and recommend it..."},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"I have found over the years that VC Andrews is especially predictable, but I still find her novels relativly enjoyable. Although a person can usually predict the outcome of Ms. Andrews novels there is still just enough there to surprise you ever once in awhile.Dawn and her family have always been poor, but because her father has taken a new job at a prep school she finally gets to go to a school that may gives her hope for a future. Dawn soon finds herself infatuated with boy who also attends school with her. His name is Phillip Cutler, and his sister Clara Sue has vowed to make Dawn's life a living hell. Before Clara Sue gets the chance Dawn discovers her true identity shortly after her mother's death, and is thrown into a new family. The head of her new family is a heartless grandmother, her sister is Clara Sue, and her boyfriend Phillip is now her brother. All of these changes have made her life very difficult to bear and left her wishing that Jimmy would come to her rescue.This is an interesting read to say the least, but as I mentioned earlier it is very predictable."},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"I liked this book, don't get me wrong, but there were a few cliches that continue to irk me. Ghostwriter, what the heck are you thinking; it's like you use some of the same expressions over and over and over again! (i.e. &quot;putaway heart&quot; and &quot;her prune mouth drew up like a drawstring purse&quot;) I lost track of how much he used the latter. Seriously, this guy needs to get some originality...and fast. While Dawn was okay of a character, I felt she was somewhat whiny as well. I personally liked Heaven, Cathy, and Audrina better. At least they had backbones. And some of the characters were pointless. This guy needs a thesaurus and some new ideas."},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"Dawn was a very interesting book. I thought the plot moved along quickly enough to keep me from getting bored. A girl discovers she was kidnapped, and is taken from her family and put into a new one that is full of deceiption and sin. I have read a lot of V.C. Andrews books, though, and they are all very similar, so there was nothing surprising in this one. The characters are interesting though, sometimes even a little comical because of all the emotional stress they put on themselves. It's a book i would recomend to someone who was bored."},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"As one of the first VA novels I read it was interesting to see the simularities to other books, however, it has its own discrete story behind these. The twist is believible and keeps you asking what happens next. But why are families so willing to take back children given away? Perhaps they feel guilty but the stories would hardly happen in the real world. Maybe it needs a touch of reality."},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"After learning that this novel is not based on any notes left by the late Virgina C. Andrews but solely is the ghostwriter's novel alone, it makes what came after this series and the Landry series as well, a let down, having seen how badly he has done by recopying what was in the Cutler series into the new Hudson series. But this is a pretty good novel. Will hold your attention from page one until the final end although, like with Darkest Hour, everything seems rushed to a fast conculsion. But otherwise, it's a decent novel."},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"This is the only VC Andrews book Ive ever read, so I dont know the difference between the ghost writer or the real one. I just know I couldn't put this book down. Sure, it was over the top, sure, there was a disturbing obsession with incest, sure the rape was taken with a grain of salt, but I didnt really care! It was so much fun. There was a cliffhanger at the end of every chapter, thus not allowing you to rest the book at all, and I just enjoyed it immensely. Lotsa, lotsa fun."},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"THIS WAS THE FIRST V.C. ANDREWS BOOK I READ. AND NOW I'M HOOKED. I READ EVERY ONE I CAN GET MY HANDS ON. IT HOOKED ME FROM THE VERY BEGINING.

Maybe it's because of the \\"ghostwriter\\", maybe it's my own maturity and preference for a different style of writing. The only book from this series that I had previously read was \\"Darkest Hour\\", and I really did like that book - however not enough to pursue the rest of the series. I ran across \\"Dawn\\" at a rummage sale and bought it for 25 cents. Although I did read the entire book, I still wouldn't buy the rest of the series. I guess I just can't get past how someone could lust after their own brother - whether biologically related, or just raised together. It's very wierd. If I found out today that my brother wasn't blood related to me, there's still no way I could think of him as anything but a brother."},{"Title":"On Planet Earth: Travels in an Unfamiliar Land","review":"Take the desolate sound of Tool and the bilateral lyrics of Pink floyd and combine it with the eeriness of the X-Files into photographs, and Staller's book is accomplished.

You must have a strategy to build a sales network, but developing the right tactics can be difficult. This collection of 37 essays will help anyone entering the network marketing business. Its short chapters, edited by Joe Rubino, cover a range of skills, from building teams and becoming a leader to devising strategy and generating leads. This overview of the most important aspects of network marketing comes from some of the industry's top performers.

Having contributors share their professional insights seemed like a good idea as well. Of the numerous contributors I contacted Beatty Carmichael, the author of chapter 22 \\"Sponsoring a \\"No\\". After visiting his website, I called and purchased one of his coaching programs from his company Success Products; web address [...]. I also purchased some support products which were something other than what I ordered. My attempts to get the company to correct the problem have been futile. There is no one manning the customer service/support number and no one ever returns calls as promised on their voice message. I finally googled \\"Success Products\\" and found that I am not the only one unhappy with the Success Products.Further, BBB in Birmingham Al, has not received a response for a complaint filed with them regarding unresolved differences with Success Products. I am wondering if the Editor of this book, Joe Rubino, knows that Beatty and his company may be on the shady side. I am writing a letter to him to see what he has to say. Be careful, if you buy this book fine, but I don't know how reputable the other contributors are to this book. I am suspicious that perhaps the book and all the contributors may be less than ethical.

It was my favorite show on TV because of the wise cracks, the super villians and the great hero himself. This book had all the fun characters I grew up with, Vulture, Dr. Oct, Cameleon, Mysterio and Electro and it just brought back all sorts of fun memories.This book (or series of books) is lot of fun. It has a ton of actions with enough detail in the fight scenes to actually see what is going on and more than enough plot and character development to tell an actual well written and detailed story. This book does have some cheesyness to it but you can't tell a spider man story and not be a little corny.The author does a terrific job with that as the cheesyness is actually well placed and enjoyable to read.If you want a fun entertaining book with a lot of action with a great story that is so well written that you can actually see the cartoon/movie played right before your eyes than look no further.Also, if you are older fart like me who grew up watching the old spider man shows on TV this will bring back a lot of great memories.I hope he writes another one someday."},{"Title":"Spider-Man: The Sinister Six Combo","review":"Wow. I haven't enjoyed a book this much for a long time. The action is top-notch, the characters are well drawn and I felt like I was reading a comic book almost the whole time. That is high praise indeed. The author does an outstanding job of sticking true to the feel and mythos of SM while still being a literary piece of work. That is not easy to do.There are some typos sprinkled throughout but that is the editor's fault, not the author's. Every writer has tons of typos and the editor has to clean them up. There were also a few times when the narrative goes a little too deep into the background of a character or history when it was not necessary. A little here and there is great but sometimes it was too much when the action demands attention.Those small critiques aside, this is a great set of action novels bundled into one tight package. I loved learning more about SM as he was always my favorite comic book character. I think this book would make a better movie than the ones out currently, even though those are great as well."},{"Title":"Spider-Man: The Sinister Six Combo","review":"As one reviewer stated here, yes, there are quite a bit of typos. The lack of grammatical editing is very evident, to say the least. Nevertheless, if you even HALF-WAY enjoy a well-done superhero story, LOOK NO FURTHER THEN THIS STORY. Castro has done an amazing job with this. Excellent dialogue, engrossing (and well-described) action, plot twists and turns galore, constant intrigue, and many comic references abound throughout this book. As far as the superhero genre goes among novels, I haven't read a better story yet. It even gets you emotionally involved at some parts (i.e. those dealing with the possibility of Peter having a long-lost sister), and the ending is both incredibly clever AND quite heartwarming, to put it mildly. I still yearn for a Spiderman movie sequel based as closely on this story as possible - but I highly doubt that'll happen. Nevertheless, if you like anything superhero related, and you've been looking for a good read - you've just found it. No hesitation necessary."},{"Title":"Spider-Man: The Sinister Six Combo","review":"...the only complaint I have is not knowing this is part 2 and 3 of a trilogy before reading it. (Revenge of the Sinister 6 & Secret of the Sinister 6) It doesn't specify anywhere on the front, back or inside cover (at least not my copy) that this is the middle and finale of a trilogy. That is the only reason for the average rating I gave it. W/ the title of The Sinister 6 Combo, I was under the impression that these were 2 unrelated stories featuring the 6.Other then that, yes it is a very good book for Spidey fans and comic fans in general. The story is well laid out and the action sequences are very much a page turner.For anyone interested in this book, do yourself a favor and start w/ the first of this trilogy series Gathering of the Sinister 6 before plunging into this one."},{"Title":"Spider-Man: The Sinister Six Combo","review":"I just started reading this book and I just wanted to let anyone interested in buying it know, it has a LOT of typos.

Full of paintings, it is obvious the publishers and Liz Bonham didn't take the easy way out of reformatting or modernizing classic Biblical illustrations. The book is visually rich with new insights. What is Judas looking at during the Last Supper? Did Jesus really smile that much? This is not another religious book to put on the shelf but something to share with friends and family. The text is indicative of Alton Howard's personal walk with the Lord. This has the look of a classic for family devotion, much like the timeless Kenneth Taylor &quot;The Bible in Pictures for Little Eyes&quot;. Unlike the classic Taylor which is for young child, &quot;Timeless Treasures&quot; seems directed to the whole family. Thanks are in order for all associated with this project. It is obvious they were all seeking the Lord and want to share this good news."},{"Title":"Creating and Enriching Business Value","review":"The book that both Elliott and Schroth have put together is really quite remarkable. It has won many awards in the year 2002 for the &quot;Best Ethics Book of the Year&quot; and continues to be a strong book in its basic thoughts. While simple by design in its writing, this book gets at the heart of the problem still being faced by corporations and businesses. Yes, it is sad that many of the things that the authors talk about is common sense. Do you think that they may have been making a point to business that with all that's been written on this topic, common sense is the one thing that has been lacking. Maybe we don't need great thinking on this topic, but insead what we need is truly a common sense approach. I loved this book."},{"Title":"Creating and Enriching Business Value","review":"The author must have come from the late 90's when everyone was &quot;successful&quot; in the dot com game. Everything in this book is common sense. Special things that are revealed makes no sense. If this is really the CTO of Perot Systems, then Ross Sr. really needs to look at where he is spending his money.The author has no depth in this subject matter. The article read like a boiler plate presentation that was thrown together for a conference where no one is listening.There are so many better books on this topic that this should NOT be on your list."},{"Title":"Racism: A Global Reader (Sources and Studies in World History)","review":"This book offers a great overall view on racism throughout the world. It doesn't just focus on the holocaust in europe and slavery in the south. The authors have various backgrounds in education (English, History, Anthropology), and combined give this book a wider perspective viewpoint. You get various articles (first and second hand accounts; some historical interpretation), glorious photos, and also guide you should you want to konw more about a particular thing.Highly recommended to anyone wanting a greater understand of our world today and why/how racism will always be a constant problem."},{"Title":"Repeated Games with Incomplete Information","review":"\\"Israeli economist Yisrael (Robert J.)

After reading these books I called Caroline for an intuitive reading and it was very affordable in a small group setting. It was the best money I ever spent, and it changed my life. After many medical allergy tests with doctors I was told I had no allergies. Yet Caroline told me what my food sensitivities were, and I was surprised by some of them. By avoiding these foods and changing my diet, I now have more energy,less joint pain, and I could go on and on, it's all good! Caroline's passion is to help people live happy and healthy lives, and I so appreciate her work. Also her books come with a free CD, which I love! You will lose weight and still eat plenty of good food, just not food you are sensitive to. Only buy these books if you want to change your life for the better!"},{"Title":"The Body Knows Diet","review":"the book arrived quickly and was in perfect condition I am pleased with the service I received from this vendor"},{"Title":"The Body Knows Diet","review":"How many diet books are lining my bookshelves? How many plans have I tried? Finally, I found someone who puts it all together. The Body Knows Diet just plain makes sense. I got it! I don't have to starve myself. I don't have to count calories. I don't have to eat foods that I don't like. What I do have to do is steer clear of the foods my body doesn't assimilate well - the foods that make me feel bloated and not look my best. And the reward? I get to eat foods that satisfy me. I look and feel my best. I no longer suffer from fatigue or frequent yeast infections, and YES my jeans are baggier already! Thanks to Caroline Sutherland, a medical intuitive of all things, for putting together an easy to follow program that makes so much sense. I'm forever grateful!"},{"Title":"The Body Knows Diet","review":"I bought this book because I was so impressed with Sutherland's first book, \\"The Body Knows.\\" I really felt her new book would be valuable, especially because of the claim from the back of the book: \\" Learn the truth - How the five secrets of successful weight loss can liberate you forever from dieting, calorie counting or starving.\\" Since her first book was so practical and lucid, I figured her second would just add to the first. I was particularly impressed with the idea of sensible habits which most likely included eliminating allergenic foods and addressing hormone imbalance. Yes, she did address these issues in the new book, and she certainly was right about no calorie counting, but carbohydrate counting was a MUST for this plan.Although technically correct that there is no calorie counting in this plan, the fact that one must count carbohydrate grams is the same - creating a log of every tiny thing you eat and writing it down, being extremely careful of every morsel that passes through your lips if it isn't a pure protein, for 30 carbs is all she says one should have for the first two weeks and 60 carbs is all one can have at all in this plan, and let me tell you, 60 carbs means meat, meat, meat and more meat, and some leafy greens, and that's about it. OK, maybe a cracker or two as well.This \\"new\\" diet is none other than the high protein, low carb diet with a twist - eliminate the five most allergenic foods, count your carbs religiously, and voila! you've got a \\"new\\" miracle diet!I do feel she had very good information in the book, however, which is why I gave the book 4 stars. Her focus on food sensitivities is excellent and gives a new slant to problems people might have while trying to lose weight. She also focuses on how moods might vary based on eating foods that a person's body might not assimilate well, and how eating these foods might sabotage one's resolve to stick to an eating plan.The book did have good information focusing on eating to avoid food sensitivities, so I would recommend it for this information. If you're interested in food sensitivities and why you might not be losing weight, this information might help you, but don't think this is some \\"new\\" diet. It's not. It just adds a new dimension to the latest high protein diets."},{"Title":"The Body Knows Diet","review":"I was not looking for a diet book. My desire was for solid advice about great nutrition. I was attracted to The Body Knows Diet to seek an understanding of why moods swing occur with different types of foods, and why some foods can cause incredible fatigue. Nutrition programs offered advice that did not take into consideration possible food allergies. The implications of not knowing this can be scary. I was astounded by the things I learned in The Body Knows Diet and this book is a must for everyone's shelf - whether you are looking for a diet or not."},{"Title":"The Body Knows Diet","review":"FABULOUS! This book is the KEY to balancing your body and being your ideal weight and Feeling fabulous! I have all the diet books and NOW I have found a book that WORKS for me and apparently everyone who does it.

Somehow wearing a maturnity swim suit when one is not pregant, does little for the self esteem. GET THIS BOOK! I no longer feel fatique and the weight is melting off. My body knows what it doesn't like and I feel so good that I feel like dancingand running and walking and hiking. No more aches and pains. I have real energy. I am so grateful to Caroline Sutherland for sharing her wisdom. I also love the CD that comes with this book. It makes me relax into a deep sleep. I also have the DVD of Caroline lecturing.

I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Body Knows Diet","review":"This book had some great ideas and concepts. They are idea's that i have actually been thinking about myself, that's why i bought the book. She also gives some great tips, however I'm not sure about eliminating all the things she says from my diet. She said herself that she just went to an allergist to figure out what she was allergic to, so basically this book just made me want to go to an allergist first before even trying her diet. Because what if you come to find out that you're only allergic to one of the things and have been cutting everything else out of my diet when you dont need to.Another thing about this book that was sort of annoying is that she repeated herself over and over again, so it basically felt like you were just reading the same 2 paragraphs over and over again just written 5 different ways, it was this way for the whole book. And anotehr thing that bugged me was that there were a lot of grammatical errors, now i know that i'm not the best at writing nor am i an english major. But when it comes to books that are dealing w/ your health is does look really unprofessional and makes you almost second guess the information being told.So basically i would recommend this book as a stepping stone to an overweight person to possibly take allergies into consideration for their problem."},{"Title":"The Body Knows Diet","review":"I have about 10 different diet /fitness books on my shelf. It has always been difficult for me to lose weight! It takes so long to lose any significant amount of weight that I have lost all my patience before I've lost 4-5 pounds.After Lisa Williams mentioned Caroline Sutherland in her blog I decided to give her dietbook a try. It took me 8 days to go from 169 to 162. I was blown away!Another very important aspect for me is how she explains my constant sugar cravings! Since I was a child I've been eating pounds and pounds of fruit every day! I remember fondly how me and mom went to the store and bought 7-8 pounds of strawberrys and ate all but half a pound which we left for dad. Just to repeat the pattern the next day. Now my mother has diabetes, my older sister is considered borderline and I knew I had to change my own eating habits. This book helped me do that.If you have any questions or struggle with something, and author always replies to any emails, so that is also a major plus!After you give this book a try you won't need another!"},{"Title":"The Body Knows Diet","review":"Once I got out all the junk food and carbs, I no longer crave the sweets.

That is huge alone for me. I wish I had learned this years ago and when my children were young, I could have started them out right instead of thinking the 4 food groups that are supposed to be \\"healthy for you\\".I am loosing weight and not putting myself down because I FEEL SO GOOD inside and out. I no longer feel fuzzy and I am off my blood pressure medicine and I am sure a lot of my past depression was from those foods I was allergic too.I feel so free and blest to have this book and program fall into my life. It is a lifesaver more ways than one. I was borderline diabetic too and NO MORE!!!It is such a relief to know it wasn't all me but the food I was eating.

I started reading it because I had nothing else better to do and then suddenly I was transported into Stalinist era of the 1930s. I feel I need to find out what I can about this author who has achieved something close to witchcraft by re-creating the psychological (un)reality of that era. I almost laughed when I read the reviewer's complaints about how the details don't add to the intrigue/suspense. There is NO suspense; only the utter illogic of possible imminent violent end to one's life for no reason which IS the definition of the Stalinist era. How this guy called Jerome Charyn about whom I know nothing accomplish this in a rather slim book much better than all the volumes of Solzhenitsyn who was actually there, I have no idea.Fatma Isikdag"},{"Title":"A Bridge for Passing","review":"Pearl S. Buck, A Bridge for Passing (Pocket, 1962)The strength of Pearl Buck's writing, it becomes evident from page one, is in her ability to tell a story as if she were sitting next to you sipping lemonade on an unseasonably cool August day. Her observations are flowery, well-described, and often at least a touch nave; one wonders, had she written the book ten years later, if it would have had the same tone it does.A Bridge for Passing intertwines the filming of her novel The Big Wave, the first major collaboration between Japanese and American filmmakers (and now unforgivably obscure), with the death of her husband of twenty-five years. And oddly, though the ratio of the two in page real estate is about 90/10, the reviews, the blurbs, and the cover reverse the ratio when talking about the book. To the rest of the world, it seems, A Bridge for Passing was a precursor to the spate of books that started appearing roughly a decade later about how to handle major life crises. The movie was just an afterthought.Not so, Othello. The movie is the mechanism by which Buck learns to deal with her grief, true, but there is much more to it than that. This is no fictional memoir; we are treated to the lives of real people, most of whom have remained obscure from the American perspective, but some of whom are not (Big Wave director Ted Danielewski, for example, has a pair of kids well known to media critics, House of Leaves author Mark Danielewski and his sister, the singer known as Poe). And when one keeps one's mind on the idea that these are real people, one starts to realize the enormity of the task Buck and her cohorts have set themselves. This is not just an on location shoot, this is politics of the highest order (and only fifteen years after the unpleasantness at the end of World War II).There is much to be said for the way in which her husband's death pervades the book, but any Buck fans who have avoided this, fearing it to be nothing but a celebrity-penned self-help tome, put your fears at ease. This one's a keeper. ***"},{"Title":"Teaching Your Children Life Skills","review":"This book is so packed with wonderfully clever ideas of how to share your life with your kids, teach them needed skills while going through your day, and enjoying time together, not viewing the chores as drudgery or unpleasant tasks , but fun learning experiences.Bravo to Deborah Carroll for not only writing a how-to parent manual that works (They always say there's not a manual to tell you how to parent.), but also for her refreshing viewpoint in treating her kids with respect and fundamentally Being a Parent, Teacher, Guide, while seeming just to be a shopper, a mom, a friend."},{"Title":"Pisces, 19 Feb-20 March (Planetary and zodiac library)","review":"I thought that these books were simply the best, because they give an accurate description of each astrological sign and break away from the typical \\"Cancer does this, Leo does that\\" mold..

In fact, since someone absconded with my copy of this one, Partners, I am re-purchasing it only 10 weeks after I originally ordered it. I reread her stuff over and over. HOWEVER, I wish she would speak with her publisher about the cover art! The heroine in this one is basically a librarian; so WHO is supposed to be on the cover? While I don't know what it would do for sales, I'd personally prefer a picture of a really cute young woman in boring beige clothes sporting fangs! It would certainly be more accurate. This is my favorite for it's wit and sense of incongruity. But I do SO HATE THE COVERS!! I guess this one is joining my set of paperbacks with covered front covers...Someone else discussed this in a May 13, 2003 review of \\"Deceptions\\":...Don't be put off by the comic book covers on this series. I mean, who needs 6 knives? Even vamps only have 2 hands, and you need one to hold the girl/guy. And, if you are going to wear torso body armor, shouldn't it cover the whole torso? And said body armor is hard to sneak around American streets in. Most authors have no input into cover art, so I don't blame Susan Sizemore.2) And a non-sequitor \\"Thank you\\" to AMAZON for reviving the \\"gentle academic art\\"(??)of book reports! I hated doing them in school, but obviously, when no longer forced, thousands of us voluntarily take to our keyboards to share our opinions of the written word... make lists for ourselves and others... and generally accomplish what our teachers despaired of us actually ever doing...

Please ask her to review this."},{"Title":"Laws of the Blood 2: Partners: Partners","review":"What a bizarre vampire series. As bad as it is, it has a fascination. It's kind of an Old Testament Bible stories on morality and history for vampires, since in this series the vampires are obliged to follow religion based laws given by the Goddess that vampires must obey or the Enforcer vampire will kill them and eat them. It is totally the weirdest vampire series I've ever come across. The first book was more serious than Partners. This one is a comedy of love about a vampire killer, human, and an Enforcer, vampire and vampire killer too, who end up liking each other. Actually, even though I'm skimming through the books at this point (not hard to pick up the action, easy read as the books are), it endures on my list of read books due to its amazing incredibly ridiculous I can't look away reality show of unbelievably silly and asinine creative plot devices that some mentalities come up with that engage interest for incomprehensible reasons. I'm going on to the next in the series, Companions, in spite of my giggling at the utter complete insane schizophrenic logic behind this series. For god's sake. Not only are these vampires besotted with religious commandments with the same intensity as fundamentalist Jews, Christians, Muslims and Hindus, but the vampires also engage in their ritualized punishments for transgressors of the faith as horrible as the Spanish Inquisitors and the human fundamentalists' stoning, cutting off of body parts and the other usual generally religion sanctioned executions of sinners all the organized faiths in the world demand. I swear I'm reading Genesis, vampire version, New American translation. And, it makes the same kind of circular leaps of illogical logic of faith and insane rules to enforce rigid, unquestioning righteous judgments that human religions do. I didn't think ANYONE could have come up with a Left Behind for vampires, and a book series that surpasses the nuttiness behind the recent Jane Austin zombie books. Wow."},{"Title":"Laws of the Blood 2: Partners: Partners","review":"I liked this story more than &quot;The Hunt,&quot; for the most part, but some things made me twitch.I was glad that some other supernatural beings were discussed, because it leaves the series open for other creatures to be brought in later. This, in my opinion, is one of the strongest elements in the Southern Vampire series. It's also one of the drawbacks to Anne Rice's books. The way her books portray other supernatural creatures is very much like a 1970s primetime series: And featuring Lestat de Lioncourt as &quot;The Vampire.&quot;I was annoyed with how Jebel could find clues and not find clues in the same scene of the book. It irritated me that the &quot;vampire glamour&quot; could convince someone of something patently false yet allow them to see fairly obscure clues that force them to deny that falsehood.I'd still recommend this book if you're into mysteries, vampires, or supernatural characters of any kind."},{"Title":"Laws of the Blood 2: Partners: Partners","review":"Just finished reading it this morning and loved it. Look for to the next book in the series. Great read."},{"Title":"Laws of the Blood 2: Partners: Partners","review":"This is a vampire-lover's vampire book, make no mistake -- blood is shed, blood is savored, and an arsenal of weapons are put to good use, from stakes and silver daggers to shotguns and a chainsaw. Given the right director, this book would make a FANTASTIC action-adventure film!But more important than the dark and dangerous setting -- Seattle threatened by a demon-led cult -- and more memorable, are the fascinating characters. Char, the young Enforcer, worries about doing justice to her first field assignment. She's confident in her abilities as researcher and scholar, but now she has to go one step further, and fulfill the duty of every Enforcer, when called to defend vampire society and its Laws, to be judge, jury -- and, if warrented, executioner. Jebel, former convict, current crusader against the forces of evil, runs headlong into a conflict between his straightforward defitions of &quot;right&quot; and &quot;wrong&quot; and the much more complicated, and messy, reality of the underworld in which Char lives and works.Every one of the supporting characters in the book -- a former vampire Companion, Jebel's vampire-hunting buddy, an FBI agent, cult members, a lost vampire fledgling -- is a well-rounded, intriguing individual in his or her own right, people you won't soon forget.If you enjoy wit and humor and penetrating insight into human nature and our definitions of good and evil, all gleefully intermixed with an exciting horror-mystery adventure, buy this book now! Buy two, and give one to a friend! You'll smile, you'll worry, you'll cheer -- and you'll end up well satisfied by a tale wonderfully told."},{"Title":"Laws of the Blood 2: Partners: Partners","review":"In my review for Susan Sizemore's previous book, &quot;The Hunt,&quot; I said that she introduced too many concepts without enough explanation, and gave us too many characters without taking enough time to develop them all. I am happy to say that these are not mistakes she makes in her second book--indeed, in almost every way, the second book is a tighter, more focused story--a delight to devour!A quick note: while this is technically a sequel to &quot;The Hunt,&quot; there are very few references between the two--you don't really have to have read the first one to understand the second, though you'll get more out of it for the extra little details you'll notice.Once again, this is the story of an Enforcer--the judge, jury, and executioners of vampire law. But instead of the experienced Selim of the previous book, we are introduced to Char, a young, bookish, lady vampire who tries to see herself as a superhero who occasionally has to eat people (but finds jokes about such activites in poor, ahem, taste). Because she is new to the job, we learn as she does, giving us a more complete world-view and understanding of what it means to be a vampire, and an Enforcer. Char is sent to Seattle to look for a newly-created vampire who has gone missing. Seattle holds a great deal of memories for the Enforcer, however--it was her home town, when she was human, and it's where she and her lover/sire lived in happier times. Char must come to grips with all these memories and jumbled emotions, while at the same time try and find out what is behind the recent string of horrific murders that have taken place there--is her missing vampire to blame?On the opposite side of Char, we have Jebel Haven, a vampire hunter whose own origin story sounds like a take-off of the movie &quot;From Dusk Till Dawn.&quot; He is approached by a worried FBI agent, who is afraid her son has fallen in with a serial killer. His trail also leads him to Seattle, where he will quickly have to decide if all vampires are monsters that need to be killed--or if there are worse things than vampires to worry about.Excellent, nicely-paced book--I can't wait for the next one!"},{"Title":"Laws of the Blood 2: Partners: Partners","review":"Char McCairn is the Enforcer. Her job is to enforce the Laws of the Blood, the rules and regulations all vampires must live by or run the risk of being exterminated. She is approached a nest leader to track down a young renegade vampire. It seems the young vampire hasn't quite learned all the rules of survival and has taken off on his own. Should be an easy job for the Enforcer, but there is one little problem. Char has received orders to get rid of Jebel Haven, a vampire hunter. Why is this a problem? Well, apparently Char hasn't had to enforce the laws before now and isn't quite sure how to go about taking out Jebel Haven. So as any smart woman would do, she sets aside the big problem of Jebel and decides to work on the small problem first to get some experience. Practice makes perfect, right?Jebel Haven used to be the scum of the earth. You name it, he did it including spending time in prison. A chance encounter with some vampires bent on destruction changed his life. Now he has teamed up with some friends to rid the world of vampires. Unwillingly, but at the urging of his buddy, he has agreed to help track down the runaway son of a FBI agent. This is quite a turn around for our former criminal, working within the law instead of against it.As fate has an interesting way of intervening, Char and Jebel find out they are looking for the same runaway. The missing teen is now a vampire and someone needs to stop him before he does any more damage. Putting aside differences, (and unknown to Jebel, Char's orders to execute him) the two team up only to become aware they have bigger problems on their hands then they first thought. Something is out there that your worst nightmare doesn't compare to. Jebel and Char have to stop it before it gains control of Seattle, both humans and vampires.This is my second book by Susan Sizemore, and so happens her second book in the Laws of Blood series (never let it be said I read anything in the proper order since I read the third book first). It doesn't disappoint. While not as hard-hitting or dark as her third book Companions, Partners is just as compelling. I loved the fact that the Enforcer was new to the job and not quite sure how to handle things. Jebel maybe our hero of the book, but let's face it, he definitely not the stuff heroes are made of. While the story is definitely dark and violent, there are some almost lighthearted moments that keeps the story moving. Being a romantic fan, I loved the relationship between Char and Jebel. For those of you who don't like the romance angle, rest assure there is plenty of blood and gore to keep your interest."},{"Title":"Laws of the Blood 2: Partners: Partners","review":"&quot;Partners&quot; is the second volume in Susan Sizemore's new series about vampiric Enforcers, the Keepers of the Law as declared by the Strigoi Council. In it we meet Char McCairn, a recently made Enforcer who has been specializing in research rather than munching on her normal prey, bad vampires. Her idyllic life in Portland, Oregon is brought to an end by two events. Helen Bourbon comes to Char to ask her to seek a missing nestling, Daniel, a newborn who was still not in control of his twin thirsts for blood and sex. The other interruption is Istvan, feared head of the Enforcers. He gives Char a special assignment -- kill Jebel Haven, a human vampire hunter who was getting too close to the truth.Jebel, after spending most of his life as a violent thug has had a defining moment in a bar in Arizona when a whole town came under attack by the primitive but deadly vampires of the American West. Now, in combination with fellow survivors Santini and Baker, Haven spends his time keeping the Wild West vampire free. Lately though, he has discovered the existence of urban vampires and is considering a change in focus. Hence Istvan's concern. Then, unexpectedly FBI profiler Brenda Novak shows up in Haven's office and blackmails Jebel into hunting for her missing son, Daniel.No surprise, the missing fledgling and the FBI woman's son are one and the same. He has been captured by a demon and a sorcerer who are using him as part of a ritual the will grant them eternal life, and slaughter most of Seattle as a side effect. Istvan, while breaking up a vampire child abuse ring, had to kill or drive away almost all of Seattle's vampires, leaving the city open to the sorcerer's spells, which only Char knows how to combat. Unfortunately, an ancient treaty makes it impossible for her to take on the demon. So Char and Jebel are on a collision course, forced by circumstances to work together in spite of inclination and orders.As you might imagine, the story takes many twists and turns on the way to its final, surprise conclusion. Expect to be intrigued and delighted by a different kind of vampire story. You will find yourself enjoying a strange mix of characters of whom the vampires are often the most reasonable. The books in the series have so far been unrelated, although there is some character cross-over in the nature of 'guest appearances.' So there is no compelling reason to read the books in any particular order yet. If Sizemore continues her successful efforts this will be a series to remember."},{"Title":"Laws of the Blood 2: Partners: Partners","review":"Partners by Susan Sizemore is the second in the Laws of Blood series. I read and enjoyed the first book in the series, but Partners is a much better book than the first, The Hunt. You don't have to read the The Hunt to enjoy this book, but it does give a lot of background on the Stigoi community.Partners deals with a young enforcer coming to terms with her new powers and a vampire killer with a criminal past coming to terms with his thoughts on 'monsters'. The Hunt is suspenseful, violent, sexy and often funny. If you are a fan of the Anita Blake series by Laurell K. Hamilton, I think you'll LOVE this book. :)"},{"Title":"Laws of the Blood 2: Partners: Partners","review":"Jebel Haven used to be the lowest scum of the earth until the former con found his true calling of killing vampires and other creatures of the night. He and his compatriots make their kills in a cloak of darkness that keeps other mortals ignorant of their deadly tasks. However, the Vampire Council is well aware of his success rate and fears he could turn into a bigger problem for them. The Chief orders the relatively new enforcer Char now a Nighthawk, to terminate Jebel.Before she can hunt her prey, a vampire mother visits Char to tell her that one of her nestlings Danny has vanished. At about the same time, FBI agent Brenda Novak coerces Jebel into helping her find her missing son Danny. Eventually Char and Jebel meet in Seattle and each wants to kill the other at first. However despite their mutual distrust of each other, they join forces to find Danny and battle a cult and its demon to the death.Once again, Susan Sizemore has created a fantastic vampire story that brings fresh life to the Nosferatu legends. The action is intense, but easy to follow, which is a tribute to Ms. Sizemore's storytelling abilities. However, the heart of this work lies in the protagonists, two partners who find themselves in a very shaky business relationship and alliance. These two natural enemies not only are attracted to one another, but are also struggling against a common opponent. The &quot;Laws of the Blood&quot; series is deservedly becoming a cult favorite.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Laws of the Blood 2: Partners: Partners","review":"\\"Laws of the Blood: Partners\\" is the 2nd in this new vampire series by Susan Sizemore.

You can't judge a book by its cover apparently. A new vampire has gone missing and a serial killer is operating in Seattle. There seems to be a connection, so Char, a new Enforcer is sent to solve the problem. She is also assigned to kill a vampire hunter by the head Enforcer Istvan. Jebel Haven and his partner were hired by the baby vamp's mother to find him also, so they are also in Seattle. Char finds that she needs his help to kill the demon and sorcerer who hold the vampire, and who are behind the murders. She is not sure that she will be able to kill him when the job is done, and he can't seem to hate her like he hates all the other vampires.This was a pretty entertaining book. The Enforcer concept is interesting and the novel was full of suspense. Good read."},{"Title":"Laws of the Blood 2: Partners: Partners","review":"Partners is the second book in Susan Sizemore's Laws of the Blood series, and while I enjoyed the first novel, The Hunt, I found Partners to be a much more energetic and entertaining read. There is a lot of life in this novel's characters, especially the undead ones, and I felt like an active observer of all the action that takes place in these pages. Partners also significantly expands upon the self-styled vampire mythology that Sizemore is crafting in this fresh and unusual series. Not only do we learn more about vampires, we are also introduced to other supernatural creatures lurking within the shadows of human society.Vampires are subject to their own special laws in this universe, and Enforcers are the ubervampires charged with the duty to enforce these laws. Vampires can only feed upon mortal flesh in authorized Hunts, for example. Most importantly, they can do nothing that would alert the human population to their presence. When vampires break the law, Enforcers serve as judge, jury, and executioner. Charlotte McCairn is a relatively new Enforcer; in the two years since her transformation from vampire to Hunter, she has spent her time doing research rather than face active duty out on the streets. She calls herself Char because that sounds tough, but she has yet to earn the distinction of the name. That changes when Istvan the dhampir, the baddest Enforcer of them all, sends her out to kill Jebel Haven. Haven is a self-styled vampire killer; even though the vampire-like creatures he has devoted his life to killing aren't actually vampires, the Strigoi Council has decided he poses a future threat to vampirekind and must be eliminated. At the same time, a vampire nest leader comes to Char asking for help - one of her nestlings has disappeared and may be involved in some pretty dark activities (of the sulfurous variety) - a definite no-no in vampire circles. Meanwhile, vampire buster Jebel Haven is coerced into taking a job of his own, hunting the very same vampire Char is searching for. The missing young vampire seems to have gotten mixed up with a demon, and Char and Haven eventually work together in an uneasy, complicated, increasingly close partnership to find him. Char plans to kill Jebel after the search is over, of course, but things get a little complicated along the way.Char is a fascinating character, learning the ways of the Enforcer before our (and Jebel's) very eyes. There is plenty of action to keep the reader engaged in the story, and the evolving relationship between Char and Jebel is not only interesting but a lot of fun to watch. After all, vampire killer meets vampire charged with the task of killing said vampire hunter isn't your typical romantic pairing. Sizemore does a wonderful job letting the relationship develop, giving us quite a grounding in her vision of vampirology in the process. At the same time, the question of how these two opposites will react toward one another in the end is never far from the reader's mind. All of this makes for an engaging and refreshingly different sort of vampire story and helps establish Susan Sizemore as a bonafide modern craftswoman in the art of vampirology."},{"Title":"Laws of the Blood 2: Partners: Partners","review":"This time the setting was in the city of Seattle. Charlotte &quot;Char&quot; McCairn was new to being an Enforcer. While at Starbucks Char heard the dhamphir inform her of her first mission. The Council had decided to kill a vampire hunter named Jebel Haven. Char was chosen to do the deed. Shortly afterward, a nest leader (Helene Bourbon) asked Char to help locate one of her younger vampires named Daniel. Char decided to search for Daniel first.Jebel Haven was searching for a missing teenager who may have been abducted by vampires. Since Char and Jebel both searched for the same teen, they reluctantly joined forces. Neither were totally honest with the other and both had deadly plans for the other once Daniel was located.A dark cult had formed in the streets of Seattle. Getting to Daniel was much harder than they believed it would be. The cult had Daniel. The main cult leaders were a sorcerer and a demon. The sorcerer would be no trouble; however, a demon was a child of a lower god. One Law of the Blood read &quot;It is death to any vampire who interferes in the affairs of the children of the lower gods.&quot;** Unlike the first of this series, I found the second difficult to get into. The first half was so slow and the scenes were scattered and choppy. Yet the second half was non-stop action.By the time I found this series, books 1 - 5 were already published. By reading the back covers I learned that each book was a different city and a different Enforcer. Char and her companion will return in book five. Therefore, I must guess that these main characters will interact with each other some time in the future. You CAN skip book two, but if you intend to read the whole series DO NOT skip it. This book will explain Char and Jebel. Since they WILL be returning in future book(s), this one is worth your time to pick up. But search a used book store first. **Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"An excellent examination of the deep, nearly invisible, internal incongruities of Western society. Read it in my early twenties and it changed my life. When you read and understand the way our minds and hearts are programmed by our society, and how that programming leads us to goals that don't satisfy or unsuccessful pursuits of happines, it's almost a religious experience.The reviews posted here don't call enough attention to the paradox Pirsig examines, and here it is:you are brought up to believe that what is right, what is true, what is logical will prevail in the end. That logic is truth. The problem is that rhetoric overpowers logic, and rhetoric is the tool of those who further their dark ends by pushing our buttons -- buttons we don't even realize we have.Sure, we all may look at that statement and say &quot;Yeah, so what?&quot; The beauty of this book is how it helps us get past that 'rhetorical' mind set, the &quot;So What&quot; mind set. Getting past it is no small feat. It's also hard to get past the smirks of your peers. This book helps you look inside yourself and realize not only where, but why you are making decisions and behaving in ways which prevent you from growing as a person and transcending the banality of consumption as a way of life.When you finish reading this book and try to explain it to someone else, you will find yourself at a loss for words because there is virtually no vocabulary, no paradigm around which to discuss it. Yet another major paradox of our society. When you extend this line of thinking a bit, it becomes clear that the message in this book is not for glib conversation, a la Frazier Crane. You can't change other people much; but you can change yourself. And that's an internal conversation.When I look at how ZAMM asks some painful, bedrock questions about our lives, I wonder where the answers are. The only book that seems to address some of the questions is Steven Covey's book on the Seven Ha! bits. Problem is, how do we un-program ourselves so we can move toward Covey's paradigm. I don't pretend to know the answer. So maybe we need the third book to complete the set for the modern philosopher.This book demands multiple re-reading. It's the most profound book I've read in English."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"Anyone with moderate intelligence and sufficient leisure can work out their own private philosophy. The worth of such a philosophy should not be measured by comparison to the great philosophers of the past (or present); rather we should ask how well does it assist its creator in coping with life. Some personal philosophies are crafted in such a way that they help, not just their creator, but large numbers of their creator's fellow beings. Thus it is with the personal philosophy of Robert M. Pirsig, who laments that he has not had an original thought in years.\\"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance\\" recounts a semi-mythical motorcycle trip from Chicago to California in which Pirsig confronts and defeats his inner demons and repairs his shattered relationship with his eldest son, Chris. With a past of involuntary hospitalization, a present of recurring nightmares, and a future of anticipated return to commitment, Pirsig rides the roads, introspects, and works on his relationship with his son.Pirsig's former self, whom he calls Phaedrus, went mad attempting to work out the meaning of the abstract concept of quality; his current self totters on the brink of madness attempting to achieve a quality relationship with his son.The book covers thousands of miles of countryside and thousands of years of Western philosophy, from Chicago to California, from the Academy to academia. Although the word Zen figures prominently in the title, and although Buddha is mentioned more than Socrates, the philosophy partakes far more of the tradition of the \\"Iliad\\" than of the \\"Bhagavad-gita.\\"Pirsig should not despair over his inability to formulate original ideas. Qoheleth wrote that \\"there is nothing new under the sun,\\" and centuries later Omar Khayyam echoed that thought. Pirsig's chosen field of rhetoric recognizes man's basic lack of originality. The first of the five departments of rhetoric is Invention, the devising of arguments. An alternative name for that department is Discovery. The rationale for this alternate name is that the rhetorician does not \\"invent\\" arguments, all the arguments already been invented. The rhetorician simply discovers the best arguments for the case at hand. The rhetorician's originality is expressed, not in the department of Invention/Discovery, but in the department of Arrangement. How well are the arguments organized?Pirsig may not have expressed any original ideas in \\"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance\\", but he has arranged those ideas in (for the 1970's) a fresh, original way. The enduring success of the book attests to Pirsig's creative genius."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"This book is appreciated by almost everyone with a desire to think and learn about the world they live in, but it's also misunderstood as to its content...Phaedrus had issues with the Greek philosophers not because they combined the nature of \\"truth\\" and the nature of \\"good\\". They did no such thing. He had an issue with them because in their desire to order the world and create a method of looking at the world which could be understood and taught readily, they decided to set priorities: They decided that facts and truth in the scientific sense of the world was of the highest importance. The \\"good\\" that had been spoken of by the Sophists and others prior to the debates with Socrates was then called \\"virtue\\" and hacked up using the analytical knife of classic thought, with lots of definitions and research expended to figure out what made it tick. The result of this is our Aristotlean world, in which people have created and organized themslves brilliantly, yet don't seem to understand much about themselves and each other.In some ways, Greek philosophers created the mode of thought for our current sociological thinkers. This mode of thought seems to say understanding the world is more important than creating a better world.Phaedrus understood that Quality isn't something that can be defined in the sense Aristotle wanted to define everything. The only way to SEE Quality is to see its effect on those who witness it. It is undefinable, because it is always different. Quality is simply what works \\"better\\" or \\"best\\". People need to understand (even now, today!) that Quality can't be defined like an object can. It's a condition that describes life, art, ideas, actions, creations of any kind, and describing it isn't nearly as important as TRYING for it.I can only imagine what happened in Phaedrus' mind when simple politics prevented him from sharing his viewpoint academically, but I've read ZAMM and it got me thinking about what people are GOING for in life. Why does it seem like everyone wants something and nobody knows why they want it? normal people don't like to ask these questions anyway, but even our best and brightest dodge the question in all but the most analytical of ways.In the end, Quality is individual, and Pirsig says that his greatest faith for the future is in quality individuals making quality decisions. I like that.If this isn't yuor kind of thing, I can sympathize: Sometimes it's very demanding to \\"think out\\" all of this books concepts, but it's a BOOK, and that's what it's best for.

The technique he uses to discuss philosophy, a 'Chautauqua' conducted in the confines of the first-person narrator's thoughts as he takes a motorcycle trip with his son, is beautifully done and makes the book a fascinating read.I'll start with a complaint, if only because the problem occurs at the start of the book. This edition is a reprint and includes some additional commentary by the author at the front. Unfortunately, that commentary reveals several rather crucial plot details, so the reader loses some of the surprise he might otherwise feel as various secrets are revealed. I'd recommend the new reader avoid the foreword until after he's finished the work, as I think I would have enjoyed the work even more if I had had to puzzle out just what was happening in the background.Having said that, the book is still a great read. Pirsig's writing style is clean and evocative, drawing the reader into the semi-fictional world Pirsig uses as the backdrop of his Chautauqua. By moving back and forth from the events of the story and the backstory, Pirsig establishes two compelling narratives, which is part of what makes the book so difficult to put down. A good story tells a single tale that makes you eager to learn what happens next. Pirsig offers two tales, and they're both told well enough to draw the reader in and make each page a pleasure.Philosophical purists may well complain that, by embedding his discussions of philosophy in stories, Pirsig buries the point of the narrative. I can understand that complaint, but I think it's unfounded. How Pirsig tells the story helps to illustrate his philosophical points as well as any more conventional philosophy text could manage, particularly as the book is written in such a way that it's easy for the reader to place himself in the author's place.&lt;u>Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance&lt;/u> is unlikely to give the reader a great deal of insight into either Zen or the art of motorcycle maintenance, unless the reader is already reasonably familiar with the subjects. What it does instead is far more entertaining, offering a new and different way of looking at the world and how we live our lives."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"There is a sort of elitism about ZMM that requires a person to either proclaim it a masterpiece, or be subjected to scorn at not being smart enough to \\"get it.\\" I notice how many other one-star reviews begin with an acknowledgment that it takes courage to dislike this book, which reveals something ominous about the cultural mystique that surrounds it.But the book itself is tedious. I am NOT saying that the philosophy within it can't be life-changing and enlightening, which is why many readers adore this book, but as a book itself it's as profoundly dull as it is profound. There are several crucial problems.First, the \\"plot\\" device of a cross-country motorcycle trip is nearly disposable. You can barely call this a novel, or claim it has a plot at all. What we have instead is a father-son road trip, a topic which had me excited to read this book. What a wonderful context for meaningful storytelling! But no, instead we have a \\"plot\\" that nearly gets abandoned; it gets so distant that at times Pirsig merely throws in an obligatory comment about the road going uphill now, as a token gesture to what was supposed to be the book's whole premise. Consequently, the narrator actually becomes LESS likable, as the 12-year-old son is nearly shoved aside for the narrator's self-involved musings. The narrator rhapsodizes endlessly about HIS philosophical obsessions, while the emotions and experiences of the son are happenstance story litter. This is ironic for a book claiming to be an investigation of values and quality. Here's a thought: how about you stop musing about your own brilliance, and actually PRACTICE quality values with your son? Merely thinking while he sits in the background of your self-absorption is abominable.Second, Pirsig accidentally mistook this for a novel. It's not. It's a series of essays with a few tacked-on details about road sights interspersed. Pirsig doesn't even pretend otherwise; the narrator actually begins many passages with phrases like, \\"What I'd like to talk about now is...\\" The narrator makes no effort to hide the fact that he's simply lecturing. If Pirsig wanted to do this, he should have just written essays instead. But to write such dry essays and disguise them as first-person musings is a dull thing to inflict on us. These \\"Chautauquas\\" go on and on...\\"Now let's compare Euclidian geometry with...\\" AARGH!This is the Ekhart Tolle of bygone decades. I've seen reviews that call this \\"exhilarating,\\" and I always wonder if people read the same book as I. Or perhaps they also regard collecting antique twine to be an \\"exhilarating\\" hobby, or spending hours ignoring your bored kid while you debate Aristotle to be \\"exhilarating.\\"Real Zen masters teach us that after enlightenment, go chop wood. In others words, enlightenment ought not to take you out of the everyday tasks that must be attended to. Perhaps that could include using a cross-country road trip to actually explore your child's mind, bonding with him in a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, rather than tossing him crumbs of attention so you can get back to your deep, clever \\"Chautauquas\\"?"},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"This book contains more than enough positive reviews from more eloquent writers than me. Therefore, my brief contribution/warning is regarding the Kindle Edition of this book. I'll try to keep it as spoiler-free as I can.In the forward to the 25th anniversary edition, Pirsig writes that he used sans-serif type to indicate when Phaedrus speaks. He believes that doing so changes the ending significantly. This font distinction is missing from the Kindle edition.I haven't seen the paper edition, so if owners of that could clarify when Phaedrus speaks, that would help tremendously.Otherwise, a great read. My real rating would be 4.5 stars, if half stars existed. The deducted half star is only for the formatting issue detailed above."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"Hehe, get the pun in the title there? Riding...writing...no takers? Eh, I thought it was clever, anyway.You know, reviews on this book tend to sort themselves into two camps, the five stars and the one stars. G'head, look, I'll wait.Back? Well I gave it three stars. Yeah yeah, I know, &quot;just to be different&quot;. Actually, the score isn't what I personally had in mind; I wanted a 5i to keep with the whole theme of reevaluation of standards (5i would be an imaginary number, for all you non-math majors), but a regular three stars is all I can get away with.The problem I've got is that neither camp seems to understand the underlying point. Those that hate it tend to attack some of the pointedly irrational reasoning as an intellectual cop-out, and then go about logically deconstructing his argument by showing his dialectic errors and yada yada yada. Yes, he makes a logically unsound argument; Pirsig comes right out and says it, and that may very well be a cop-out. But which is worse, the philosopher who retreats into these illogical defenses or his attackers who don't have the balls to follow him and defeat him on his own ground? The way to effectively win a debate is to turn your opponent's argument back upon itself, not to run back to your own incomplete abstractions. Example: don't use words like &quot;substantive&quot; and &quot;subjective&quot; (which Pirsig goes to great pains to redefine) and apply the Webster's definition to them. It's just weak. Someone in one such review said on the dichotomy of subjective and objective that &quot;there is in fact only one, the objective; the subjective refers to the fact that we can only see one portion of the objective universe.&quot; First, even in traditional definitions of these terms, this is NOT true. Just go to a crazy house, or better yet, just pay attention the next time you're dreaming; the subjective is EVERYTHING. If it wasn't, you wouldn't be on Amazon writing an opinion because there would be no opinion, only objectivity. Duh. Kant knew this, Freud knew this, and so did everyone before and after them. Second, the very argument proposed is a redefinition of these terms; to go back to the old definitions is to simply miss the point--in other words, language like this basically reduces everything else you've said to absolutely nil.Now for the five star camp...oh God. &quot;It really changed my life&quot;, &quot;it really had an effect on me&quot;, &quot;it really breaks down the system&quot;, &quot;it's really original&quot;...what did it REALLY do? Honestly, tell me, I'm dying to hear, because the fact of the matter is that most of the stuff contained in the book is derivative. Some people get the credit that they deserve, like Poincare and Thoreau (and if this isn't a sequel to Walden, I don't know what else it could be). However, the most influential thinkers don't. Nietszche broke down the subject/object dichotomy a LONG time ago and in just this fashion, and even took it a step further; he proposed an entire restructuring not just of thought but of grammar. If the divisions between subject and object are artificial, then so are subject and predicate; therefore, as the subject and object are actually one in the same perceptively, then the subject should not be seperated from the actions he/she/it performs--indeed, those predicate actions are what DEFINES the subject, not the other way around. To make my point, get off the soap-box. You honestly do more to make people shy away than to win any converts. I've read little in this book that is actually original, except maybe the part about a man riding his motorcycle. Now THAT is creative.But for me...sure, I like it. It's been a great read, and the unification of Eastern and Western thought is especially provocative. And whether you like it or not, the fact is that technology has, in some way, caused an alienation in the 20th century in the consumer; Pirsig thought he had an answer, and here it is. Maybe he's wrong, but at least it's a start, and not a wholly bad one either. It's the first time that many concepts (like Zen and Bhudda) have been explained to me in terms that made concrete, relative sense, not just mystic mumbo-jumbo. It tends towards density and boredom sometimes, but I believe Pirsig has a point for this. He invokes Thoreau, who used an extremely similar technique, early on, and in one of my favorite parts elucidates in a VERY tedious manner the various equipment he takes with him on the road, and I couldn't help but be reminded of Thoreau's bean-planting ventures in Walden (especially since Pirsig mentions how boring Thoreau can be right after he's gone on about his knapsack for 5 pages; it's called tongue-in-cheek humor). On the whole, though...just too idealistic, yet again just like Thoreau. But read it for yourself--I do highly recommend it regardless of it's shortcomings--and make your own decision; that's the whole point, not to hear my rant or rave on it.One final point to make to the detractors. *IF* you're going to argue against this book, it's so simple to do that you look like a moron for not doing it. Pirsig says Quality is self-evident, right? And you say that you don't like the book, right? And an understood point that he makes is that Quality is present in this book. Well by God, then that Quality hasn't made itself self-evident, therefore it isn't present to defend itself, and therefore Pirsig's argument is in ruins. See how easy that was?"},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"1. You have an interest in philosophy but have been put off by the literature spawned by academia on the subject.2. You are passionate about pursuing meaning/value/purpose/that which is good.3. You are interested in high-level thinking about the world; theorizing that could hold everything in the world together, from art to science to religion to motorcycle repair.4. You have problems with either science or art (i.e., \\"I'm not a science/art person\\"), and would like a bridge to understand or appreciate better the world of science or art.I write this review primarily because I consider this the best book I have ever read, and it has made a profound and lasting change in the way I think about everything. That said, it's a fact that some people will like this book and some won't. Rather than speak to the relative merits of the thoughts Pirsig proposes (judged how exactly?), I write more to offer my thoughts on whether the book will speak to you.There have been some rather hostile reviews of ZATAOMM from philosophic academia and from those who think it is over-hyped or just plain boring. As to the former, some have suggested that the book is so bad that it will forever ruin the mind of anyone interested in studying philosophy. Anecdotally, I read this book when I was 17 and proceeded to earn a philosophy degree with honors from an ivy league university. More generally, I question the motives and mindset of anyone who feels that mere words could forever ruin a person's intellect.That said, it would be a waste of time to analyze this book from the analytical paradigm of American philosophical academia. If that's your perspective, more power to you, but don't read the book if you can't/don't want to suspend that mentality for a moment to consider an alternate mode of thinking. As to those who find it boring, that's another way of saying the ideas raised in the book don't speak to you. While I felt it was a pleasure to read, ZATAOMM isn't a masterpiece of literature; it lives and dies on its ideas.Finally, over-hyping anything is dangerous, so while I obviously loved the book, I advise anyone reading it for the first time to read it with an open mind, with no expectations. Pick it up--you'll know in the first thirty pages if you'll like it."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"OK, maybe I'm being a little too harsh. I actually enjoyed the idea of the cross-country motorcycle ride, the details about motorcycle mechanics, and especially the portrayal of the narrator's relationship with his son. The son was the best part of the whole book. Unfortunately, there wasn't much space for sonny, because dad was too busy advertising the author's brilliant philisophical insights. Even more unfortunately, the insights weren't brilliant, and consumed hundreds of tedious pages. It occured to me to wonder whether the author was trying to make the point that the narrator was a pompous idiot; however, the intent seemed to be for the reader to be blown away by the brilliance of the narrator's philosophical insights, and hence by the brilliance of the author who conceived of the narrator and the philosophical insights. I can't believe I made it through 380 pages of this."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"Robert Pirsig's incredible tour-de-force in this book is literally the intellectual adventure of a lifetime, and one that still leaves me shaking my head in wonder after thirty years and a number of readings of it. I was introduced to \\"Zen\\" by my brother in law, who promised me that I would enjoy it. By now I must admit to now having several short quotes from it framed under glass at various spots in the house, because I was so taken by the gravity of what he has to say, and the disarmingly simple way he usually chooses to say it. Pirsig is a man with a lot to say, and a lot of wisdom in what he has to offer.Although I must admit that I do not agree with certain key aspects of his argument regarding the way the ancient bifurcation between what he calls romantic and classic perceptive orientations can at last be repaired and restored to cognitive and intellectual unity, I stand in utter awe at the quality of mind any human being must have to marshal such a breath-taking effort as this, at the accomplishment of conceiving and articulating the philosophical treatise described in such loving and painstaking detail here. His grasp of such eclectic, obscure and philosophically central notions truly is a feat quite the equal of the ascent of Everest in terms of the levels of concentration, mental endurance, and simple cognitive acumen necessary to muster this kind of argument.The book works on two levels that both assist and complement each other. First, the story narrative, which he uses both to illustrate ideas he is talking about and to introduce ideas he wants to discuss, also acts to bring us back to &quot;normal everyday reality' after spinning high in the thin cold air of his theorizing. Second, the philosophical story becomes a kind of sophisticated detective story for curious intellectuals, as Pirsig's alter ego, Phaedrus, searches deeper and deeper into the mysteries that once led him into insanity because of the sheer intensity of his efforts to solve the riddle of the difference between the two seemingly irreconcilable aspects of reality (the romantic and the classic).The book is an awe-inspiring trip into a discovery of the nature of reality, contemporary society, and yourself. It has led to study groups, study guides, and a whole cult of Pirsig watchers who consider him the functional equivalent of the wise seer. The wildly best-selling book also led Pirsig deeper into a life of isolation, eschewing publicity and seeking greater introspection. There is a sequel, called &quot;Lila&quot;, which also enjoyed a best-selling run on the charts in the early 1990s. This is a book that is quite unlike anything else you have ever read, and is something you have to experience to understand in its full impact. It is also a book I can recommend with a smile, knowing with confidence you will be glad you finally decided to buy it and read it.

I would also disagree with the book cover propaganda that it is a book about how to live your life better (there is nothing of the sort contained within these pages.) However, one cannot dismiss this book which has remained a \\"must read\\" for the decades it has been in print. This book weaves 3 \\"intertwined\\" tales: a travelogue of a man taking an aimless cross-country trip with his \\"crazy\\" 11-year old son on a motorcycle (seriously?), a meandering walk through a modern person's biased view of Greek philosophy, and the lion's share is about a teacher/student who loses his mind questioning things too deeply (and abstractly) as he fights the establishment with no real reason besides proving he is right. I can sum up the general zeitgeist of the book in two words, \\"question everything.\\" Should this be a must read? Probably not, but like Wikipedia, it is a jumping off point for the reader to question their own life and way of living and jumpstart their own journey into philosophical dialectics."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"Nice book,easy to read.

I believe it was revolutionary at the time, but now if I wanted to find out more about Asian philosophy, I'd go right to the source (and have, see Masao Abe's Zen and Western Thought.)What I did find interesting in the story was the narrator's portrayal of how he remembers what he was like before he had a nervous breakdown and received shock treatments, as opposed to how he is now. He attempts to reconcile his emerging original personality with his new one in a way that parallels his integration of Eastern and Western thought.I wish there had been more focus on how the re-emergence of the original personality was going to affect his family relationships. Would he go back to his obsession with philosophical questions to the exclusion of his family, or would he now be able to find a better balance?A final thought is a quote I heard recently to the effect that the more a man considers his work to be revolutionary and important to the world, the more likely he is to have a nervous breakdown, which seems to be what happened here."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"Quite simply, this book changed my life.

I've also wound up with an odd collection of motorycles over the years and many, many miles around the country. I credit many successes and insights to this book.Despite my obvious bias, the book is well written and damn interesting. It does get tiresome at points, and it does linger too long on some philosophies, but that's part of the ride. Every trip has times when you just want out of the car, but it's always most rewarding when it's actually taken you somewhere. I belive this book can. There is a lot of hype and subculture surrounding this book, some merited and some not, but don't bother reading this or any other book for those reasons.

Granted, these are topics that are discussed. But the main thrust of the book is about how we understand things, the most important things, like who we truly are, that is, our true nature, beyond all delusions and ego, beyond the dualistic view of subject and object. Pirsig gets at this by examining Quality, a term that changes meaning as the book progresses, ultimately coming to mean Reality itself, the true reality. Along the way, values are discussed, the nature of rational thought and ways of approaching the ultimate Meaning are discussed. First Quality is left undefined. Then he attempts to define it. He argues with Greek scholars. He blames Aristotle and Plato for snuffing out the Sophists, who teach rhetoric and aspire to reach arete, excellence, which Pirsig says is the same as Quality, or Dharma, or the Tao. He says that acceptance of the ideas of Aristotle and Plato have led to a dualistic mythos that carries on to the present day, resulting in technology that is lacking Quality because separation of subject and object lead to a lack of care. Finally, Pirsig realizes he should have left Quality undefined, that it is in fact beyond definition. He realizes the futility of rational thought in his quest for ultimate answers and gives up his intellectualizing, letting go of everything, all ideas and wants and desires, and in doing so reaches the core of his being. He steps outside the mythos of his culture and looks bad in doing it and ends up getting electroshock therapy. The culture pronounces him insane.

This book is quite unique. It is a narrative about a father and son taking a motorcycle trip circa 1968. A real trip. You can even see pictures taken on the trip on the web, so now a reader can see the actual characters in the story. I don't know if the story was altered much to fit the design that Pirsig intended, but the trip serves as a metaphor for a rambling lecture on the nature of reality itself and our interaction with it.It is a metaphysics book. The motorcycle trip narrative is interspersed with talk of Greek philosophy, calculus, Poincar&eacute;, Pirsig's own descent into madness and return to a brittle sanity, flashbacks to Pirsig's years as a student and a teacher, and his musings on the concept of \\"quality.\\" Loosely speaking the viewpoint is Buddhist, though Pirsig's metaphysics is really his own creation. I suppose one might say that he attacks a purely mechanistic view, that this way actually leads to madness. He demonstrates that there is at least one logical flaw in the scientific method, and shows why following that method slavishly cannot lead to solid, certain truth.It is very heady stuff. Not having a photographic memory, it does not stay in my mind. One can reread and marvel at the revelation of one subject after another, pulling it into his lecture (or \\"Chautauqua\\" of the mind as he calls it) about reality and quality. As the voyagers ascend the Rocky Mountains, he gets more and more abstract. In the high rockies they stop for a while, look around, rest, and then they head down to the west coast and sea level, where he tries to bring the discussion into a more down to earth, everyday realm. What does this mean for living on a day to day basis?If you are a Christian, you might wonder, how does a Buddhist book apply to me? Why should I even read this? While Pirsig aims for a combination of intuition (feeling) and experimentation, the Christian must rely on the Holy Spirit for revelation, and the Scriptures for grounding. That is for his moral life. But for everyday things like... oh, fixing a motorcycle, for example, there is not a moral or immoral way to fix it. There is a right way and wrong way. There are effective ways and on the other side there is failure. Here is where Pirsig might be more practical, for everyone. And as another reviewer pointed out below, this book might be more social commentary than philosophy anyway.Mostly though, the book is an intellectual thrill ride, a roller coaster for the brain. People ride roller coasters again and again. Or jump out of airplanes. Or climb mountains. This is a mountain climbing book -- where physical and philosophical and scientific mountains are scaled, and then you come back down, exhilarated and exhausted.

They head out across the high plains thru Montana, then down the Oregon-California coast.The bulk of the story is Pirsig's first-person reflection of the trials of his alter ego, Phaedrus, who is first a college English teacher, then philosophical questioner who ventures to the would-be sources of all understanding. An ambitious project to be sure.Pirsig all the while is connecting the thinking of Phaedrus to Pirsig's own contemporary thinking on his journey through the mountains and plains of the Great Northwest. Pirsig uses the motorcycle as a metaphor for life: both the work it requires and the joy it can bring.The Buddha, the Godhead, resides quite as comfortably inthe circuits of a digital computer or the gears of a cycletransmission as he does at the top of a mountain or in thepetals of a flower. -- Robert PirsigThe book alternates between Pirsig making an observation or working out some difficulty on the road--either with his motorcycle, the people he's with, or his son--and engaging some large philosophical issue the ancients have discussed, which is of profound importance to living our lives wisely today.I remember when I first read it, I was so enthralled with the insights of Phaedrus, in particular into the nature of Quality, that I skimmed passages where Pirsig discusses current reality.

Electro-convulsive therapy doesn't have that effect anyway."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance is, primarily, nothing less than an explanation of the actual nature of the process of a sentient entity interacting with physical reality. Within the book, Mr. Pirsig &quot;labels&quot; this process as Quality.To understand this work's breadth, interlace the above with an impossibly frank and human self-examining account of a lost father, tenderly cradling the damaged mind of his son, on a cross-America motorcycle odyssey.Introduce a haunting spectre from a terrifying past reality; an inscrutable horror, ever so slightly out of sight, but roiling into a recognizable truth.To this already writhing brocade add a nose-to-nose staredown with madness, at a mind-shaking level of lucidity.Incorporate the tragedy of a shattered family.Then interweave these components into a vast streaming scroll encompassing ancient thought, the absolute edge of human understanding, morality, family, society (East and West), and the meaning and power of love.This is an offering from the humble yet utterly fantastic mind of Mr. Robert Pirsig.Make no mistake, this book is a tall task, with the unavoidable frustrations of lost channels of thought (yours, not his), seemingly bottomless vessels of philosophical exploration, and a knowledge that you are, for a time, as one with a soaring intellect. The reward is a thunderous quiet; a fast-fading visit to a realm of laser definition.Mr. Pirsig will melt your heart, electrify your mind and recolor forever how you look at everything.It is one of those incredibly rare books which you will read again and again, every few years, just to re-establish contact with that awesome multi-dimensional clarity, Mr. Pirsig's trademark.I have owned likely 20 copies of this book. I don't have one now, so I am buying more here. I don't know why, I just keep giving them away. Many people I know do the same.If the book eludes you the first or second time, set it aside and pick it up again in a few months. You will align with it in time. And there will come a time when you will look at your children, then grandchildren and say, &quot;I have something for you; something wonderful.&quot;Oh, one more small thing: &quot;Lila&quot; is as good, maybe better. It is a brush with the universe. I would, however, counsel all to read &quot;Zen And The Art Of Motorcycle Maintenance&quot; first. Its a great primer."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"First off, when I finished the book (in a twelve hour reading marathon) I was breathless. But... If its quality he preaches, I'm not sure how Pirsig stacks up against his own rigorous standards. Surely he is deeply involved in his work. Surely he has become one with this book. But... It's that profound involvement that I think sometimes alienates the reader from what is a remarkably difficult piece. But... As I flipped through pages about mathemeticians and scientests I never cared about, banging the book on the wall waiting for it all to make sense, I could NOT put it down. In the end he does not dissapoint, but if I hadn't read some passages six times over, I may have been in the dark. It was all worth it, as I mull over in my mind some of the last lines the chills down my spine freeze my fingers. Read it with all your heart or you won't do it or yourself justice."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"Book reviews should do two things: one is to examine the readability of a work and the other is to comment on its content. \`Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance' is certainly readable though it can be rather slow going. Really slow going. Sometimes I found it hard to push through to the end of the paragraph. The conversations feel contrived and artificial. There is a plodding sensation to the story that never quite goes away.As for content I'll admit to being unimpressed. This is old stuff now. Authors like Wayne Dyer and Depak Chopra have been making tons of money off this stuff for years. The pseudo-scientific \\"What the Bleep Do We Know\\" follows right in line. As an example, Pirsig gives a very poor argument for the subjectivity of natural law. Nature and natural law exist only in the mind of the individual, he explains badly to his son. There is no objective reality - only that which you make in your mind. His son doesn't get it and only the most accepting reader will.My guess is that the book touched so many lives because of the newness of the material to Western minds thirty years ago. There are much better books now on both Occidental and Oriental philosophy that make a whole lot more sense."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"This book changed my life. I've read it several times, and each time I get something new out of it. It is the defining book of the 20th century. Pirsig redefines what Quality means in our culture. You will never look at material objects in the same way again, in fact you will be forced to reevaluate the way you live.His narrator gets inside your head and sets up shop there. His narrative is intriguing, thought-provoking, emotionally shattering, and often times so complex you will find yourself re-reading passages to make sure you understood them correctly.Told as much as a mystery, as an adventure tale and a dissertation on how we live with technology; with all it's intellectual depth and probing of ancient Greek philosophers, it's remarkably easy to read, clearly written from the point of view of the layman. This book should be a mandatory read for every high school student.The 25th anniversary hardback edition is beautiful as well, and features a new introduciton by author, Robert Pirsig. Take the time to read this masterpiece. You'll thank yourself, over and over."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"I first read this book more than 10 years ago, and still can just pick it up at any page and find something in it to bring some peace and reflection to my mind. That reason alone is enough to make it worth five stars to me, but my text copy is one of the books I've lent out most frequently over the years and each person has taken something good and different from it. Even if that something is what they disagree with it has been a thought provoking read, and that is rarely a bad thing."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"Robert M. Pirsig's Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance is a great read. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a non-fiction philosophical novel.Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance is an autobiography, allowing Pirsig to narrate his own life experiences. Along with sharing his motorcycle trip with his son Chris and some friends, he mainly focuses on what quality is. What is quality and how do you define it? He believes that it doesn't exist. In this certain area of the book it is harder to comprehend, but he does prove a good point that I agree with. He goes into great detail explaining his belief that quality is something made up, and he actually gets pretty emotional about it as he struggles to find the truth. On top of all of this, Robert Pirsig is schizophrenic, dealing with his battling alternate personality, Phaedrus.Some weaknesses I found include going into too much detail about some ideas; they seemed unnecessary. He drifted into too much detail about some philosophical ideas and terms that the reader wouldn't be prepared for and didn't explain them well enough. Also, at the end of the book, his Phaedrus personality actually takes over; however, throughout the book he reflects back on how he was a student in India and his experience there, but that was his alternate personality. Since he went through electroshock therapy, there is no way he could have remembered any experiences Phaedrus went through.Though he couldn't have remembered these things as Phaedrus, Pirsig does do a good job at helping the reader understand what he's going through as he battles his alternate personality. As mentioned before, he reflects on his experiences in India and has multiple dreams about those experiences. Though he wants to deny it, his son Chris also struggles as he tries to figure out if there is something wrong with his dad; asking questions and reflecting on good times in the past with his father makes his dad realize that it was Phaedrus that experienced those good times. Along with this, the reader is able to understand how Chris feels about the whole situation: he wants his dad back, you know, the dad that he has great times with and loves so much . . . Phaedrus.This book really makes the reader think about how to find truth and if quality actually exists. It also lets the reader take an adventure inside the narrator's mind as he battles against his schizophrenia disease. I recommend this book to anyone who loves to think. As Pirsig himself writes, \\"The place to improve the world is first in one's own heart and head and hands, and then work outward from there\\"."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"This is an extraordinary book. It is the story of a man who sets out to \\"find the Truth\\" and actually succeeds!But not many people have appreciated the true significance of this work. Sadly that includes Pirsig himself, judging by the Afterword. They talk about the '70s, the hippie generation, counter-culture, etc. ZAMM has nothing to do with all that! I repeat: it is the story of a man who sets out to find the Truth and succeeds. Pirsig starts off as a typical Westerner, swearing by logic and reason. But he ends up as a mystic, in the Eastern tradition.There are quite a few criticisms that can be levelled against Pirsig's approach. Though he refuses to define 'Quality' it is clear that initially he means it to be something similar to 'Beauty'. Then suddenly (and conveniently) 'Quality' becomes 'Truth'. Eh? Also, his interpretation of ancient Greek thought - that Plato buried 'Good' with his concept of 'Truth' - is questionable. Mainstream opinion is that the Socrates-Plato-Aristotle trio fathered the dualism (Good/Evil) of the Western mind, as against the monism (Truth) of the East.Still, the book is not without its strong points. Though the search for Truth is a highly individual and subjective quest, one can always gain insights from another's journey."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"It took a long time to write a review for this book. I generally try to write them within a week of finishing. It gives me time to absorb what I read yet it remains fresh in my mind. For some reason, this took a full 2 months before I wrote this review. That doesn't mean I forgot what I read, far from it. This book is so full of valuable discussion that it would be impossible to forget much of what it talked about. After all, the content here is heavy enough to maintain a cult following 30 years after it was first published.Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance is quite a good book. I don't know how else to start this review, other than to say exactly that. It's a classic that sat on my pile of books for years and years (and years - really, it was that long) before I picked it up. That's a shame, because this is something I should have been picking up again and again throughout those years. More than likely a timeless classic, Zen stays in touch with all levels of reader despite taking on a very mixed subject matter.A philosophical journey brushed with Buddhist undertones, this is a mysterious autobiographical adventure where Pirsig jumps head first into a slowly moving story which delves in and out of the mind of the narrator. Focusing on the issue of value, Pirsig attempts to ferret out the core of quality which drives dinner conversation across the face of the Earth. What is good? What is bad? How do we assess elements of this nature which fit into these good and bad boxes?Truth and value, pillars of our social institutions, come under the scrutiny of Pirsig in the pages of this book. Challenging illusions we delude ourselves into believing, the text offers numerous questions and commentaries which lead the reader to question many things they may have previously taken for granted.Blending Eastern and Western thought, Pirsig walks down a well-trodden but poorly paved road that many in the West try and fail to comprehend. That doesn't mean Pirsig understands it any better (or worse) than others who have ambled down this same path. It merely means he walks down it, and lends space to both schools of thought without wholly selling out and decrying one as superior. An impossible stance to take for almost all who try.At times the book does bog down in slow meditative conversation. I don't think it detracts enough to make the book less than excellent. But it is something to consider when going into it. Those expecting Earth shattering revelations will need to step back and reassess what they expect from a book. Much of the text is meant to be consumed and ruminated upon. Reading 100 pages in a day is a sure way to misunderstand most of it. You would do yourself a favor by limiting the number of pages taken in any one day to less than 10. Here is a book to promote thinking. Take the time to do just that.This book can (and should) appeal to any variety of reader. However, it will likely appeal more to those who actively want to better themselves and their lives, but not in the typical American manner of throwing a fist-full of cash at it. The idea is foreign to many in a land of cash-based happiness. Pirsig does not address this. I merely bring it up to preface who might enjoy reading this. I imagine the Conservative base will not take kindly to the book. Likewise, people beyond a certain age (is that Thirtysomething these days?) will likely be less concerned with a lot of the ideas here, believing they already have all the answers they need. I strongly assert that any person from any angle can get a lot out of this work.This is a book I plan on reading again. I have cautiously ordered his sequel, Lila, because this book was so good. I can't expect it to be nearly as good. But it goes to show how much I enjoyed the first one. Needless to say, this is highly recommended reading."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"Zen and the Art Of Motorcycle Maintenance is a long, tough read. Although it may be long and difficult it is a must read for any person who condsiders himself/herself an avid reader. Even for those who do not read on a regular basis it is a must read. I enjoyed the book; it made me think of things out of the ordinary. For example: Do you have definition of Quality? You may think you do, but ponder the definition of Quality for a matter of seconds and you will immediately find out that you cannot define Quality. If any type of philosphy interest you, this book is a must read. The author, Robert Pirsig, is a very smart indiviual and has had a difficult past. The book reflects his thoughts pertaining to ALL aspects of life. I think you'll find that you either strongly agree, or strongly disagree with the author. Even if you don't like the book, you'll be glad that you've read it. As far as the book is concerned, it is about a cross-country motorcycle trip involving Pirsig and his son Chris. The trip will terach you about, values, humanity, humility, family, and most of all your inner-self. The book will lead you into the depths of your human soul. Sometimes, the book is hard to take, but you must keep on reading because it will teach you something. I loved this book and recommend it to all who read."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"I read this book the year it was originally published, attracted no doubt by the word Zen in the title. Conversant with philosophy and especially Taoism, I found the book's subject matter interesting and thought provoking. I especially liked the tension Pirsig created with the confrontation between the college professor and the protangonist, Phaedrus. I likened it to a confrontation between an atheist and a minister who has lost his faith yet keeps on preaching in the face of his own doubt. I reread the book recently and then began looking through the various reviews logged at this site. The greatest recommendation for this great book comes from those who give it the lowest rating. As in so much of life, the ones in most need of understanding are least prepared to find it. The reasons they list for not liking the book are the very reasons it should be read. Does that sound zen-like? ZAMM is one of the great books of all time. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"I am reading ZAMM for the third time and am finding it even more marvelous this time than the first two times (when I loved it). This book becomes more significant with the passage of time. Not only are his ideas illuminating and always fresh, but his take on modern society -- through his own experience with what is so loosely termed insanity -- is absolutely on target. His wonderful descriptions of his bouts with academia are both funny and unsettling, especially the excruciatingly entertaining episode with the Great Books seminar in Chicago. Pirsig is simply a beacon of independence and a roamer of the high spaces of the intellect invaluable to set off intellectual sparks and new approaches in anyone drawn to ideas. I think he would be worth reading if only for his elucidation of Kant's ideas (I have never been able to make head or tails out of Kant). A wonderful, wonderful book with something for everyone who thinks."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"This book changed my life. This is one of those books that you either get or you don't. It is all about timing. When it was my time, I stopped doing everything else to read it. I was in the throes of a major mental meltdown. The world I was physically living in was not the world I was living inside of my head. The separation had become almost unbearable.If you are a thinker, analyzing everything (and I mean everything) and have reached the point that you are not sure you can think any deeper and that the rest of the world around you seems far away, this is your book. If you are peeling away the onion layers of the mystery of life from a purely intellectual standpoint and you have realized that it can be infinitely sliced and you are questioning your sanity compared to those around you, this is the book for you.Sure the author is relatively depressed and the tone is not overly buoyant, but this book will take you on the ride of your life. It will take you to the edge but it will not take you over the edge. You will come back and you will come back feeling relieved. You are not alone; there are millions out there who feel the same way. Or this book may save your life. It brought me back by making me realize someone had taken the journey I was about to take and made me realize that it was not the route I wanted to take.Update: I work with people who are homeless, including those who are schizophrenic, chemically addicted, living with other mental illnesses and a whole host of other life issues.This book stands the test of time. Mr. Pirsig was fortunate enough to have lived as long, and as well, as he did before it became too much for him. Many people never return; these are people I see daily. This book, quite honestly, helps the rest of us understand what others with similar thought patterns are living with every day. This is more than Boomer self-indulgence, as one reviewer noted: this is what people I work with wrestle with in their minds every day of their lives.Mr. Pirsig shows us that it is possible to get out (even though the details of his journey back is somewhat skethcy). His follow-up, Lila, is also highly recommended...."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"This is a brilliant piece of work. Although the book teaches a new way to look at reality, is not however new to the Eastern mind. Pirsig's notion of Quality is what Lao Tzu talked about 2600 years ago in the Tao Te Ching. Pirsig does mention this, however, later on a lot of the theories he comes up with, which are derived from Quality/the Tao, can be found in the Chuang Tzu, which is obvious that he hadn't read when he wrote ZATAOMM.How can this book change the way you see the world? It can surely expand your mind. Religions tend to tell people that if you don't believe in X then you go to hell. And atheists think that all this God stuff is a figment of man's mind. What the Taoists and Pirsig argue is that Mythos, becomes reality when it is embedded in a society's &quot;a priori&quot; notions. The concept of &quot;a priori&quot; intellectualization means that we are all programmed (over time) to interpret a certain relative reality...and therefore the Christians and an African tribe that worships the sun, are BOTH living in a 100% real (relative to them) reality. No one is right or wrong. If we live and understand Quality/Tao, the undefined/pre-intellectual underlying reality, from which all diverse myriad realities come from, we can respect all religions, nations, ideas, opinions, and creatures. Who says are reality is more real that an ameba's? We can also finally join the hands of scientists (the classics) and the artists (the romantics) - and melt the object and subject into one entity.It is too bad Pirsig never wrote an academic book, because even though this is studied in Universities, it is still classified as an autobiographical novel.Get this book."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"The significance of Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance is incredible. Pirsig takes his readers on two very important trips; one through the states to Bozeman, Montanna and a profoundly significant philosophical journey. Pirsig confronts his former self, Phaedrus, as well as some of lifes most perplexing questions. He does so using the dialectic and rhetoric as tools for discussion. The author's former self, Phaedrus, is consumed by the Aristotelian point of view and all that it stands for. Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance is read today, and remembered by scholars who read it when it was first published, and they continue to be amazed; as will I in twenty years."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"The author and his son Chris travel from Minnesota to California by motorcycle. At first they are accompanied by another couple, but, a bit later, father and son are left to continue their journey alone. Throughout the trip, the author is deep in thought which is reflected in the paucity of communication with his son and more communication with himself alone.A reader involved with this book must either have great fortitude or a fervent interest in philosophy to make it to the end of the story. Despite its haunting quality, its philosophic meanderings are often overwhelming for the casual reader. Best reserved for a reader who likes to \\"work\\" at reading, ZEN AND THE ART OF MOTORCYCLE MAINTENANCE, is a sad but profound story of philosophic theory, mental illness, and a father-son relationship which will leave a deep impression on those willing it struggle through it."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"To some extent I can agree with another reviewer that said this book was incredibly boring. But I basically attribute this to that fact that I did not quite get what the author was trying to say to me. Perhaps this is because I'm young and inexperienced in life or maybe it's because I have no experience in philosophy and therefore had no idea where he was coming from. This is a book that I will have to read again in a few years and then hopefully it will make more sense to me.In the end I walked away with something very valuable and I don't regret one bit that I suffered through all 418 pages. If you want an easy read...don't read this book!! If you are currently going through a time in your life where you're being very introspective and at the same time are feeling critical of the culture around you, then I would definitely recommend this book."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"A few years ago, I wrote a review of this book. I share the opinion of many others that this book is a foundational work. Maybe not to all of western culture, as some detractors try and mistakenly claim about its praises, but foundational to some of the individuals that read it. At that time, I was a single teacher/coach and was convinced that I pretty much knew everything that I was ever going to need to know. I read the book to my AP Calculus classes for what I thought would be important to them as they went on about their lives after high school.Now, I am married and will be having twins in May 2001. I am still teaching and coaching, and I am still reading this book to my classes. But now, its to show them what it has done for this one individual, and leave it up to them to find out if it is really something that can help.Zen has now impacted over 10 years of students. During my decade in the classroom, Pirsig's dialouges on the workings of our understanding have given focus to my teaching in a way that no class or mentor ever has. His ability to write about ideas that were so precious to him, and still put it in a way that allows a reader to think for themselves, evaluate for themselves even ENCOURAGE a reader to do so; may be the most valuable lesson that I could ever teach.For me it was a must read. I happened upon it during my own little journey, in a bookstore in the NYC subway system. Right under the Citibank building. I had heard it had something to do with Montana(I was born and raised there) so I picked it up. Over the next 350 miles of bicycle touring, it moved me in such a way that I can barely explain. I'll put it this way. I'm going to start reading it to my twins in December. They are not due until May."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"If you like to read more profound work that is going to make you think, go ahead and read this book. I first bought it when I bought my motorcycle and had no clue what the book was about. All I knew was that it was a famous book. As a theology/religion/philosophy junkie I was pleasantly surprised to read this great work. If you have any doubts about the book, just think about it: it was written 25 years ago and it is still a best seller! That should tell you something. Read it, no, more than that, savor it!"},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"Of all the angst in modern life, the principal manner of thought with which we most often struggle is that of the seemingly limited choice we face between only one action(thing) or another(thing): does one marry or remain single?; does one raise a family or remain childless?; does one fight or accept peacefull compromise? Deeper still is the troubling notion that people may now more regulary unconsciously view others as either objects or subjects, rather than the multi-dimensional, holistic beings we really are.Pirsig's basic tale--yet profoundly philosophical insight--about an undefined essence called &quot;quality&quot; being the true force behind all decisions of man or nature, offers a unique alternative to the way we have classically limited our attitutes to the &quot;yes or no&quot; solution. How ironic it is, also, to read Pirsig's insightful exposition of how history's renowned Greek philosophers both enlightened and elevated the western mind while trapping it, at the same time, in a cognitive subject-object division that we rely-on today.The essential &quot;paradigm shift&quot; in thought and attitude suggested by &quot;Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance&quot; will become far more meaningfull in this 21 century, as people grow ever more technologically dependent, and simultaneously emotionally-isolated, from one another.This book is an essential read for both the less-engaged, as well as, the deepest of thinkers among us. And like the Zen concept of Mu(that non-thing in the middle)which Pirsig speaks about, it can offer insights for all of us &quot;somewhere in the middle&quot; people, also."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"This is one of the most fantastic books Ive ever read. Both journeys the spiritual and the physical on which author Robert Prisig takes is absolutely breathtaking.

After reading this book ine feels strongly to go on a motorcycle journey and be &quot; in the scene&quot; .

I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book, four stars out of five for me. If you haven't already read it, I suggest you read Godel, Escher, Bach by Douglas Hofstadter next. Hofstadter picks up where Pirsig left off and delves further into holism, reductionism, dualism, etc."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"I read this book so many years ago it is a miracle I still have it in my collection. It sits dusty and tattered in an honored place on my shelf behind my desk with my Isaac Asimov tomes as if one day I might pick it up and read it again - which at the moment is very unlikely due to the stack of yet unread books in front of it.I bought this book because at the time I was into motorcycles, cross-country trips, and I did my own vehicle maintenance. It had some of that, but it was soon evident that this book had little to offer to anyone planning a cross-country trip on a motorcycle. Yet there was a bigger story - about insanity and sanity. I stayed with the book because I was also very much into exploring psychology and philosophy.I was very impressed with this book - not so much for the gratuitous philosophy, which I found boring, but for the story of an intelligent man who went insane, perhaps because he read too much of other's philosophies without developing his own, who subsequently underwent electroshock to \\"purge\\" his old identity and form a new one, but in time (culminating on the cross-country motorcycle trip narrated in the book) recovers his old identity, safely merged with his new identity, and more or less now safely \\"sane,\\" however we define sane. And the burning question raised as to whether such procedures as electric shock had merit as a medical tool.I believed the story was an actual account, and the author assures us that it is indeed based on facts. As a factual account, it thereby has merit and a real lesson to be learned - which would probably be different for each reader.Some of the reviews here seem to focus on the philosophical content as what makes the story meritorious, and suggest the story might be nothing more than a fabricated account created to stealthily teach the reader philosophical concepts. I disagree, non too disrespectfully. Rather, I think, it was too much absorption of the philosophizing of others that led to the insanity and loss of identity, and it was not until he developed his own philosophy, perhaps synthesizing this and that from others, that he becomes sane again.I like philosophy, but only my own and the philosophizing attempts of the ancients as they initiated incipient science, philosophy and mathematics. However, I detest most modern philosophy, especially that associated with modern concepts of secular progressivism, as so much mental masturbation - perhaps it feels good, but it has little to nothing to do with furthering humanity, and perhaps a lot to do with corroding and confusing social values.This book has great merit, not for all the bits of philosophy interspersed, but for the realization the story might help us achieve that we must in the final analysis create our own internal philosophy that is workable and realistic - as president George W. Bush so colloquially said - to be \\"comfortable in our own skin.\\""},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"Take the journey with Phaedrus.

It begins with a man (the author, unidentified in the book), his son and two friends traveling through the Plains by motorcycle. Pirsig follows the storyline for the first few chapters where he describes the friends less as characters of a book and more as people not going into depth about their background, the motorcycles less as technology and more as the mixture of science and art, and the scenery less as mundane and more as open and freeing. Together the effect of this examines \\"how we live and how to live better\\" through the perception of differing ideals.Opening his mind, Pirsig travels between being himself and his alter-ego, Phaedrus. He follows Phaedrus's path through Montana learning about his past life. As he walks into the school where he previously taught, Pirsig recalls his ideas as a professor, and his most common belief that the withdrawal of grades would, in the long term, motivate students. Deviation from the plot like this is common shown through other discussions on the meaning of quality, feelings versus reason' and \\"scientifically produced antiscience-chaos\\" (114).The book delves into an influential and puzzling stream of thought as Pirsig struggles with his relationship with his son and his philosophical, Zen-like view of the world. Although Zen is considered eastern, Pirsig takes a western approach while he raises mental disorders, questioning between religion and science, and humanism. Despite major but necessary digressions from the plot line, Pirsig writes this story to hold the readers' attention, as he questions fundamental believes and traditions in the western society.

Many of the themes and insights pop up from time to time, and so I sit down and read it again every couple of years. It still continues to blow me away..."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"The home truth as home-run: if ever a homily returned to roost on the shoulder it must be the closing remark in Zen and the Art of Mototorcycle Maintainance that;'Trials never end of course. Unhappiness and misfortune are bound to occur as long as people live but there is a feeling now that was not here before, and it is not just on the surface of things, but penetrates all the way through: we've won. It's going to be better now'. The relief of those last few pages proves all too brief.Whew! Reading a post-script in an early 90s reprint of his 70s classic, we find his son, Chris(the 'we' alluded to above) stabbed to death in L.A for the sake of a few lousy bucks. Such a senseless and casual death by unknown assailants! Now that indifference rails against the overriding healing of the book's preceeding 400 pages.That such news could disarm me, late news at that, of someone I'd met only in print, reflects Pirsig's power to make real his plight. And if you didn't find it in the 70s you might, as I did, find its reverberations have currency. A re-reading has the doubling impact of reclaiming a younger self, echoing the retracing Pirsig is doing in his text. It's a remarkable book for more reasons than I care to note here. A brief synopsis tells that Pirsig, attempting to understand himself, raids the premises of contemporary thinking. He finds himself in Pre-Socratic times. His clear and elegant prose dissects some gristly philosophy. This prose is the aesthetic response or appeal to the problem of present thinking and the journey we've assumed as pillions with Pirsig and son. To maintain suspense in this pseudo travel-journey there's a parallel story of Pirsig recouping his ghost self from shock therapy. The impulse for this arrives from the disengagement sensed between Chris and himself. The eleven year-old's moody abstuseness has been diagnosed as the early rumblings of mental disease. They're on vacation, biking from Montana to the Pacific Ocean. The process recovers old stomping grounds and resucitates glimpses of Pirsig's former self. The analogy to bike maintenance(the real bike work is that you apply to self discovery) reveals facets of both his selves. And the reconciling of these selves verges periously close to its very opposite: a permanent rift.As Pirsig spirals back to the Greeks he strikes the dichotomies between classic and romantic attitudes, hip and square, science and aesthetcs, rhetoric and dialect. Concern for these dualities, as old as Western thinking, encouraged the cult status of the book, especially endearing itself to art campuses in the 70s, wherever such issues were debated. And how to perceive it...with caring, for which vigilance is the prime requisite. Pirsig offers his homespun system of gumptionology: steps not to lose sensitivity.So Pirsig revived the art rhetoric in pop culture and the art cognescenti embraced his Zen because it lauded the aesthetic life. Rhetoric is our proper form of display, our fantasy-filled capacity to live out our synptoms and pathologies through letter-writing, painting, yarnspinning, singing, movie-making and the rest. His absorption absorbs us through the depressive lows which precede compassion. I'd rate this probing internalizing on a par with the revelations of Dostoevsky's Raskolnikov."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"The most important part of this book, for me, was that it made me consider what sanity really is. Mr. Pirsig roughly defines sanity as living within the mythos of one's own culture, not necessarily the religious norm, but the philosophical norm. This can be quite an interesting point to ponder when one chooses to live outside the norm. Are they really insane, or just questing onto the \\"road less wandered\\"?Like Phaedras, the Platonic character from which the author takes his alter-ego's name, the question of Quality is also examined in depth. He traces the meaning of this word back to the Ancient Greek idea of arete, or the duty to one's self to always perform in and honorable and exemplary way. This book considers the idea that we no longer value arete or Quality as part of our philosophical norm.As a narrative, this book is about a father reconnecting with his son after having a breakdown. However, at its core, this book is about an inner journey. It is one of those books that can be read over and over again throughout a person's life and you will always find something new of value in it- something that you are receptive to in that moment. Not only do I recommend the book, but I recommend reading it more than once."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"This was a very excellent book. Pirsig shed a lot of light on some the issues in life which I have been looking for, but have had trouble grasping.

What is good and what is bad? -- once you begin pondering over these issues you may never come to a full conclusion. But this book centres your thinking like no other book has done for me. It's made me think beyond what I would have on my own, and that's surely something. It's also stayed with me, ominously at times, providing an unique strength at other times. A book that I've read more than once, a book that I can open again and again and read from any part. It's a part of me now that I know is a part of me. It's probably the best -- most valuable? -- book I've read. I hope you're lucky enough to read it too and share these feelings."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"I listened to this on tape and have to admit, I would have struggled to get through if I tried to read it. This book raised some important issues and did it in an entertaining and thought provoking way. I enjoyed the back and forth between past and present, the references to Greek philosophy and the telling of the journey itself. I cared about Phaedrus and his son. After listening to it I did buy the book just to be able to go back over some of the parts that had so many layers. It seems people have a strong reaction to this book because when I asked the bookstore clerk where I could find Zen, another customer joined the conversation to tell me how many times he had read it. This book also caused me (and my books on tape group) to listen to Lila, his follow-up novel which continues Phaedrus' story years later. It was also one of the books the group has listened to that generated the most discussion."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"I thought tha Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance was a terrific book that really causes the reader to take a look at their own value system. It takes you into the past and present lif of a man in search of himself and reality. The only thing that kept it from recieving the full five stars was the fact that it tended to get a little slow at times and the writing seemed a little amatuerish. Other than that it was a gem. For me it allowed for a look into who I am compared to who I used to be and who I want to become. I would be very interested in reading more or Robert Pirsig's work. I would also recommend this book to anyone who wants to read a provacative, emotional book. Even if you don't apply it to yourself, it still brings up some worthwhile questions."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"Looking over the reviews for this book, I realize that those who were forced to read this book hated it, while those who chose to read this book loved it. In reality, this book receives so many mixed reviews because it is exactly what it's criticizers say it is: long winded. But those who chose to read this book know that such as book is not meant to be read casually, and is not meant to entertain, as some might think. This book was written to be read slowly, thoughtfully, and interestedly. When read in such a manner, the reader who gave this book low ratings will understand why other readers gave it a high rating; and will agree with them.

The book deals with crucial elements of the development of Western philosophy. If Western mentality today lacks desirable elements, it's extremely difficult to tell when or where or who chose a less favorable path. Mr. Pirsig suggests that the error can be traced back to the Greeks. This conclusion itself seems to relie on a misconception, because it's unlikely that there's anything like an ideel philosophy. Anyway, the book dares to adress such complex questions and gets away with it. That's an effort in itself worth 4 stars, I think. The story consists of a past and a present situation. Personally, I find the past far more interesting than the present. I admit that the story would suffer much if the present was erased, still, focus could have been even more on the past situation."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"This thought-provoking work provides insight into ideas in a fictious manner, yet implies much more. It utilizes historical perspectives as well as the author's own insight to discover what is good and how is it defined. The book dabbles in various topics and inspires wisdom in every reader.

Anyone who is wandering through life looking for some meaning, pick this up at once."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance is perhaps the most tedious, pedantic, tiresome, misleading, and intellectually-barren book I have ever had the misfortune of reading. Perhaps the worst thing about this self-absorbed, unreadable rant is that on every page, Persig seems compelled to draw attention away from his text's lack of substance by providing countless misrepresentations of all the great philosophers. Not only does he use language that is dry and uninteresting, but he incorrectly describes nearly all of the philosophers and philosophical systems that he mentions.Pirsig's book is nothing more than adolescent rambling. On every page, Pirsig arrogantly and vainly tries to portray himself as some kind of synthesis of erudite Western scholar meets wise Eastern sage. Nothing could be further from the truth. One of the most despicable aspects of his pedestrian work of pseudo-philosophical tripe is that he uses his own quasi-philosophical terminology to describe concepts that could better be represented using the terminology of existing systems. He constantly tries to reinvent many philosophical terms, and then misuses other terms. The result is a most confusing and convoluted read, especially if you are already versed in philosophy. Perhaps the saddest thing about Pirsig's mock-literary atrocity is that many people seem to regard Pirsig's arrogant tirade as an introduction to philosophy. Nothing could be further from the truth. The book could potentially serve as a dull introduction to pathetic, narcissistic, schizophrenic authors who manage, through some quirk of fate, to achieve popularity, but that's about it..."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"I read three hundred pages of the four hundred and thirty or so between the front and back cover. There is only one other book I can recall so vehemently closing for good and that was Prozac Nation. There may not be a direct connection, but both narrators seem to whine a lot. At least in Prozac Nation we know the narrator is a self-indulgent nymphomaniac drug abuser.I understand this book is philosophical in nature, and my review may come off as unlearned and ignorant. I am neither, as I have had academic exposure to the material before picking up Zen and the blah blah blah. This book is neither about zen nor philosophy. It's a whole bunch of whining about some prettied up existential crisis the narrator suffers. The author inflicts his issues upon the reader without a sense of reason, though he attempts to explain reason over and over and over. I thought for a second, around page one hundred-fifty or so, he might be on his way to eastern philosophy on the Gita and doing one's duty for its own sake but he lost me again with more whining. I put this book out in the trash. If I want someone's existential crisis foisted upon me, I'll settle for my own."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"For once, believe the hype.

For once, a book about which one shouldn't be embarassed to use words like monumental, or life changing. To imagine that, in this day and age, as tacky and driven by sheer greed and consummerism as they are, someone actually could actually go insane because of Aristotle is proof that maybe not all is lost.

Definitely not what I thought it would be; really, with several philosophy classes under my belt from a long-passed undergrad, I found it to be annoyingly extended and rambling. The Kubric-esque twist the narrator reveals may have been cutting-edge reading in the mid-70s, but has been done many, many times since. As a bit of a classical-leaning individual myself, as well as being a motorcyle rider, I found the technical deficiencies to be distracting.I would not recommend this book to someone wanting to learn about Zen, Buddhism, or even basic gestalt psychology. But if you have a general interest in basic philosophy, especially that of romanticism vs rationalism, then definitely give this a read."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"I first read Zen prior to my freshman year of college and it was a book that I enjoyed reading while at the same time being challenged by in depth ideas that it presents."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"Winning is more than beating the other person.

Almost nothing to do with motorcycles. And contains more ancient philosophy than a college text.Some say ZaMM was autobiographical. I hope to God that it wasn't.I read it over 15 years ago and HATE-HATE-HATED the book!!! Between the seemingly endless volumes of philosophy, that lead character was so haunted by Phraedus and his quest for &quot;good&quot; and &quot;truth&quot; and &quot;beauty&quot; that he never opened his eyes to appreciate the world that motorcycling or life in general was bringing to him. In the first night or two of camping, his son complained of stomach problems. He ignored the kid, &quot;Go take care of it, son&quot; and then casually mentioned to the other couple that &quot;His doctors say it's psychological.&quot; No wonder the other couple took off on their own way. The guy was a total A$$ and a BAD FATHER! It was a classic example of how his madness made his entire family dysfunctional, and small wonder he wasn't liked by friends that he tried to make. I slammed that book down several dozen times because I was so angry with him. (But I was determined to finish it.) I won't spoil the end for you, but no wonder THAT happens! And I'm sure the lesson he learned was only temporary... As you can see, he still makes my blood boil.On a sad note: Robert Pirsig's son, Chris, was stabbed to death in SF, coming out of a Zen temple in 1979.

Booo! Low blow. I enjoy reading philosophy, but this book was awful. The author is just plain illogical. He draws ridiculous conclusions. If you are going on a journey of the mind, you should not have a guide who is incapable of thinking straight. If you love this book, then you will be very comfortable with illogical statements and I recommend you read a book on logical thinking."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"When I take an account of the things that were a complete waste of my time in this lifetime, this book will be in the top ten.

Turned into one long megalomania rant. I loathed this guy by the end of the book and wished I could have reported him to CPS for his lack of parental skills. Hiking up a steep grade and NO WATER? What a moron. Maybe the incredibly poor nutrition may have been 90% of this guy's problems.Presently, I live in a university town and the author reminds me of oh so many of the instructors who THINK they really have something to say...and everyone else KNOWS they don't.

Pirsig has lots of opinions. He presents his lofty ideas in a fictional story format, thus avoiding the criticism that normally comes when presenting ideas in a peer-reviewed format.However, ultimately, his book profoundly changed the way I think and see the world, or whatever. I recommend giving it a gander.One huge take-away that I can remember was his distinction between classical (intellectual) and romantic (non-intellectual) modes of thinking. I'm not sure what I make of that idea anymore, but it affected me deeply.

It embodies a deep examination of personal and technological values and how we arrive at them, and is written by a man who thinks a long, long time before he writes. (A two-book career is something of a rarity for one whose first shot was a bestseller, and remains in print in multiple languages 30+ years down the pike.)Pirsig's later tome, LILA: An Inquiry Into Morals, written ten or fifteen years after ZEN..., is also the tale of a journey -- on water. Though it too is profoundly thoughtful, the metaphors seemed weaker, the translation from personal to universal more tenuous. Then too, the author and I were both that much older, with the sharp distinctions of youth unavoidably greyed by the accumulated ambiguity of life. Yin and yang may be a central truth, but as we come to terms with paradox we learn a bit about compromise.As some other reviewers have noted, Zen is in some measure dated and a period piece, but it is bound to remain an important work for many young readers as they come of age."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"I first read this book in 1976... it has occupied a prime spot on my bookcase ever since.

I felt that the book was significant for me but couldn't grasp the depth of it. Now, in my thirties, I read it again and it landed. It didn't change the way I looked at the world but it totally confirmed my view and put it in words. Pirsig perfectly describes the drive (named 'Quality') that is running our lifes from behind the mind-scene: Quality in search of itself. Understanding this is not a mental thing, not something to be exercised. It just happens to you."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"If your looking for a book that talks about philosophy, this is it, even though it is sometimes incredibly hard to make sense of it. This is truly a book that will force you to think. One must figure out what Pirsig is trying to say through pages upon pages of rambling about the meaning of things such as quality. This is a book to STAY AWAY from if you are looking for a good read.The book starts as a seemingly interesting story about a boy and his father on a motorcycle trip; however, as the book goes on, more and more of Phaedrus, Pirsig's other personality, comes back. The further one reads, the more complex and impossible to understand it becomes. At points, I was just praying for Pirsig to go back to talking about the motorcycle trip, yet as the end neared, I became very interested in what was going to happen, and I must say, I was not let down."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"That tells you everything you need to know about this book. Nearly every single person that has ever read it has either loved it or hated it. There is no middle ground. And appropriately so.Sure, I can tell you how much I love this book.

It was written by Robert M. Pirsig. The book was published by HarperCollins Publishers. Mr. Pirsig also wrote &quot;Lila : an inquiry into morals&quot;. Anyways, now to the point.If you are going to read this book, make sure you want to do some serious thinking. If it is big actions sequences that you are looking for; this is a direct hit. However, the action doesn't play out on the pages, instead it is in your head.The book takes place on a trip Mr. Pirsig takes with his child and his friends (His son stays with him the entire time; however, his friends are only around for part of the book). During the trip he thinks of both his past, present, and future. Mr. Pirsig has had a very interesting life to say the least. Pirsig spends much of the book using the motorcycle maintance analogy to relate to your life and how you take on certain tasks. I guarentee this book will change the way you think. I didn't say whether or not that was a good or a bad thing, but it will change the way you think.Many people will find this book to be to dry. The book doesn't have much action as I said before. However, if you go into the book with an open mind you may get a lot out of it. The focal point of this book is your thinking about what is said, and really that would be the only problem. If you don't feel like thinking there are a million other books out there. But if you want to re-access the world around you, sort of put things into perspective, this is your book.I think this book is well worth a look. I was given a list of books to read by my professor and I chose this one (some of my friends had read it). Basically, I know I made the right decision. At first I was a bit weary. I had only a couple days to go and I had barely gotten to the 100th page. I started to turn on the book. Then, in the middle of all my cramming, my view of &quot;when is this damn thing going to end&quot; suddenly changed to &quot;wow...this guy is right..&quot; and when the book ended suddenly seemed to be an imminent downer.When it did finally end I was very happy with my decision to read it and I highly recommend it. I have already suggested it to a few of my friends and I plan to re-read it again shortly."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"The most common problem that I've heard about this book is that the first few (?) pages are about motorcycle repairs, so readers give up there. Wait!Reading this book opened my life up more than any other experience. Pirsig's deconstruction of Western philosophy helped my spirit out of a closed mind that a years of study and churches and alternative experiences had not. (not that it holds the charm for everyone)It might help to have just a little knowledge of Greek philosophers first. You could check an encyclopedia listing for Plato and Socrates? It is helpful to know that those two have been very influential in Western history via the school system. I mean knowing something of their stature in Western thought may increase enjoyment of this bookPirsig presents relentless undeniable logic that you can learn to trust your own judgement, and follow your own dreams, and everything should be for the best.

Excellent."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"Z.M.M. is a deep and impressive work which has sold millions of copies and stayed in print in many languages for over twenty years. I recently read it for the first time. It was good to wait until I was ready for it. I am not sure I can recommend the book, but I am glad I experienced it.Mr. Pirsig presents the story of his search for the roots of deep philosophical views and his exploration of the branches of those views, from which branches hang all of the results Western civilization, not the least of which are universities, motorcycles, and mental hospitals. The philosophic system he proposes is to my knowledge unique and original, as well as marvelously free of endorsements or adherents.I am very interested in exploring how the models or paradigms in which all of us live lead to action. I did not explore Z.M.M. with a purpose of determining whether his system is true or even useful. I just like to know what the world looks like inside other people's heads. The world from inside his head looks wondrously intricate and interconnected, a world in which a man's motorcycle maintenance methods are determined by the intellectual in-fighting of ancient Greek philosophers. He is generous in the detail with which he shares pieces of his fertile and facile mind.I very much appreciate the effect reading the book has had on my experience of household repairs. I installed a dishwasher the day I finished the book. I found myself happily immersed in the project, even through a greater than usual number of &quot;gumption traps.&quot; ZMM helped me see many obstacles and &quot;wrong turns&quot; more powerfully. I could be with the problem and still be in action. I enjoyed it more, regretted the time spent less, and feel more satisfied with my life. This shift has endured several weeks, through garage cleaning, shelf mending, and hard disk installation. My life has been greatly enhanced by just this one aspect of Pirsig's philosophy.And yet...The narrator's life described in ZMM strikes me as sad and lonely, filled with failure and lacking in purpose. Measuring it against the three tenets of MayoGenuine (be genuine, be learning, be transitive) is illuminating. His great strength is his genuineness. He is also an intense learner in the traditional sense of accumulating knowledge and building systems, yet this information never seems to support him in taking the actions that would give him a satisfying life. His behavior does not alter, so learning in the sense in which I use the word does not occur. Most tragically, he seems highly isolated from human relationships, preferring the role of sage observer to participant or leader.

The ironic thing is that if one has this opinion, dissenters simply say &quot;you merely don't understand it&quot;. This angers me. I have spent much time studying Zen, and can find no correlations between this book and actual Zen tenents. If you disagree, please email me with your comments"},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"It's hard to understand how the word Zen made it into the title, since the book itself never really spends much time with Zen practice or ideas. Set as a road trip, the novel recounts the reunification of a personality split by shock therapy into a before and after. Alongside this narrative is a philosophical investigation that attempts to dissolve mind/body dualism ending with a frontal attack on classical Greek philosophy (Socrates, Plato, Aristotle). It takes thousands of miles and dozens of monologues, but eventually unification is attained by reaching BACK to the pre-Socratic Sophists. But as any road trip will tell you, there's no going back. And just as the narrator's unified personality utilizes his newly found dedication to motorcycle maintenance, the answer to mind/body lies ahead of us. Think neurobiology: now mounting the most telling rebuttal to mind/body and, ironically, a direct descendant of the systemic approach to knowledge created by classical Greek culture."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"This is a great book and very moving. A bit sad and pretty deep. For those who are new to zen and some of these concepts it is very significant."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"This book is great.

It will change your perspective on life."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"I read Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance in the 1970's. It was hard to read at times and yet I could not get enough of it. This is one of the books that changed the direction of my life and how I look at the world. I love having it on my Kindle, to refer to,and reread it, much like I do with Moby Dick also on my Kindle."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"I received great and fast service.

Attempted to read many years ago, could not get through the book some +25 years ago, my head was just not at that point. Now with tens of thousands of mile under my belt, a more mature view of life and the world, this is a great read. If you ride a motorcycle, and have been a rider all of your life and enjoy taking matters into your hands from mechanical to mental, put this book on your to do list."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"This is not an easy review for this is not an easy book. One thing I think I'm sure of is that it's not about Zen or motorcycle maintenance.On the surface the book is the story of the author and his son with some friends travelling across America. However this provides the environment for the author to share and explore a range of questions and issues including rationality, attitudes to technology, philosophies of life and the meaning of quality. What the book does is create the opportunity and invite the reader to explore these questions and others that they are stimulated to identify themselves. It's a book that provokes and requires the reader to think. In a sense the book becomes and is what the reader makes of it.What I made of it, and what makes the book exciting for me, is this approach through the vehicle of a novel of creating an environment in which the reader is teased into thinking through a range of extremely challenging philosophical questions. Many readers unwilling to engage in this process may see little in this book of value viewing it as being over complex and lacking in immediate gratification of a standard novel. Others looking not for questions but answers will be disappointed that the book has not the rigour they are looking for and provides no solutions.However for those who want their thinking stimulated and their understanding challenged this is a demanding but very rewarding read that will probable warrant being reread several times.I realise that the above says little about what the book is. I take comfort by quoting a passage from the book that I think releases me from having to describe what it is and invite you to find out what it becomes for you.As Persig says, \\"The trouble is that essays always have to sound like God talking for eternity, and that isn't the way it ever is. People should see that it's never anything other than just one person talking from one place in time and space and circumstance. It's never been anything else, ever, but you can't get that across in an essay.\\"All I can say is that whilst this isn't everyone's cup of tea, it's the kind of book that just might change the way you see yourself, your world and your future. If you decide to read the book I recommend the 25th anniversary edition as this has some additional explanatory information by the author and also an interesting exchange of correspondence between the author and publisher which gives an insight into the creative process."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"This book was first read to me by my brother when I was around 6 or 7 and it has stuck with me through present college life. Recently, I've just started to read the text again....for the first time.The book on tape read by Lawrence Pressman, though abridged, is absolutely a joy to listen to during a long airplane or car trip."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"This book is a fine read on many levels. I can think of no better introduction into the basic themes of rhetorical theory, Western philosophy, and travel literature. Pirsig offers the basics of a systemic philosophy -- something no philosopher has attempted for the last fifty years. It is a fine antidote to relativistic existentialism! It is curious how readers either love or hate this book. It is less curious that those who hate the book rarely offer comments that truly engage Pirsig's main argument. If you don't like the book, slow down and read it again."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"There are at least two reviews here which criticize the lack of factual infomation on the subject of Zen philosophy in this book. Perhaps it would be a good idea to check the first few pages and read Pirsig's disclaimer. I don't have a copy handy, but he says something about the fact that the reader shouldn't mistake his book for an actual treatment of Zen philosophy. So if it bothers or offends you, scratch out &quot;Zen&quot; and write in &quot;Quality&quot;. Then, if you feel you must, present some sort of valid criticism."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"I put this book down the first time I attempted to read it, just after I finished college coursework many moons ago. Since then, I've tried it again and again, and read it to completion four times and find that I love it.The tales unfolds as a mystery wrapped around, as it says, an inquiry into values. The narrative itself is clever, and I won't reveal any more of that, but as it pushes, excruciatingly slow at times, it makes a case - in fact, numerous cases - for the importance of quality (as opposed to consumption of quantity) in our lives, and deliciously weaves those inquiries into the narrative. Unfortunately, I found those discussions at times to be so deep, deep, deep, as to frustrate me to the point of putting the book down. But as I am drawn back time and time again, I realize the value the &quot;inquiry into values&quot; has had on my life, or at least in my inquiry into it.I encourage you not to beceome so frustrated you don't go back to it again. And again."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"I have read the book. I put the five not so much becuase of the book itself but rather because of what I thought it would contain. I am only eighteen but I have mixed feelings about the book. First of all I plan on majoring in religious studies and the original reason I read the book was to read about zen. I found little of that there if any really and I was very dissapointed. The objection I have to this book isn't the actaul story because that does make you think which is something few books seem to do for me but rather the fact that you can find it under zen buddhism in a library. I would rather have it under philosophy. It changed me to the extant that a well written book changes anyone but it lacked faith. That I think is why americans like it so much. . . maybe. then again I am an american too so who knows? it is ineresting. go for it if you can't decide."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"Zen and the art of Motercycle Maintenance was a rare treat. Mr. Pirsig did a great job with it. Philosophically sound-- yet light and easy to read. His story needed to be told."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"I read Pirsig's book for the first time in 1979 while on my way to Japan and was greatly moved by it. I later used it in teaching writing and reread it at least four or five times. Recently, frustrated over how computers and the Internet are changing people's lives (including mine as a teacher), I reread it and found Pirsig's ideas about technology just as applicable as they were before the current computer revolution began, whenever that was. It was like a visit with a wise old friend who's just as sharp as he or she used to be!"},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"The duality of peoples' reaction to this book relates to the difficulty of finding and confronting issues in one own life. The first three times I attempted to read this I had to give up, but once I made it past (ch. 6?) it was an astoundingly important work, and the entire book, including chapters 1-5, became vital. Each time you read this thing it seems like a different book!"},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"This book is a deeply moving story of one man's struggle with mental illness. It's more than a &quot;why things are&quot; tale; one of the few that answers the question &quot;so?&quot; Pirsig teaches us a calm acceptance of taking things one day at a time. I recommend reading this book every couple of years. Modern-day Hesse but more realistic."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"First I realized more than ever before travelling through America like Pirsig did,is really attractive.(I'm a European: Belgium) Then I got that terrible motor-cycling passion. And finally I discovered the astonishing quest of a man desperately searching for foundations in life. This book tells different stories. A trip trough America that comes so much more."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"I first read this book over 30 years ago and it still has a tremendous appeal to me. The author decribes perfectly the connection between a rider,his motorcycle and their surroundings.I thought his discussion about the &quot;Gumption Trap&quot; and his decription of a sloppy vehicle repair facility to be particularly good. I loved the book because I am a motorcyclist not a philosopher."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"This book obviously rings true in the hearts and minds of many people. I don't agree with some of the things in it, and think that maybe there is even a better word for the book's central concept than &quot;Quality&quot; (though I can't think of one--maybe that's part of its indefineability.) That fact remains however, that he awakened in me a way of looking at the world that changes everything. Baseing actions and viewpoints on the &quot;quality&quot; in things can save a lot of wasted effort in life, and make that life much more enjoyable. That, I think is the book's greatest point, and what I took from it. Pirsig tried to write his book as a classic, and I think he succeeded."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"It did to our narrator. But what a tale he tells! It seems that most of the reviews of this book revolve around the obvious lessons. But like Allen Bloom's &quot;Closing of the American Mind,&quot; if you are not grounded in classic education you will wind up like me, wondering what this book is really about. The motorcycle analogy, like parables, tells a story with a hidden message that portends to be spiritual. While the meaning of our lives from an eternal perspective is danced around, it is not the central message of the tome, which I find it's weakness. I feel the author is looking for answers in the intellect, but they are only available in the soul. The quest for quality in life is a worthwhile journey that we all will account for someday, and this book will benefit all those who care to ponder the journey."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"Perhaps this book is so popular because of the timing of when it was published and since then it has run on its own momentum. In any case, to the curious reader, be prepared for an unoriginal, mostly dry, dull book. If one wants and intro to Philosophy, one would do better to read Durant's &quot;The Story of Philosophy&quot;, Russell's &quot;History of Western Philosophy&quot;, or nearly any intro to philosophy written by someone qualified to speak on the subject. The attribute lacking in the author of &quot;Zen&quot; is humility. He seems to think that any pedestrian insight he has is original with him. He does not seem to be aware of even the basics of western philisophical thought. Although he apparently has had much classroom instruction on the matter, maybe he doesn't listen well, or he can't give credit to others for having ideas also.On the positive side he has a few good analogies, but these are few and far between. If the point of the book is that &quot;quality&quot; is a mysterious word because its difficult to define, that's true of many words, try to define &quot;the&quot; or &quot;of&quot;. Is his point we should not always chose quantity over quality? Oh ,please! That is hardly an original idea. The author and his fans seem to believe that any idea that crosses his mind is worthy of worldwide attention. A dialogue on philosophy has been going on for hundreds of years, and many very bright people have contributed their thoughts. It is very naive and arrogant to imagine that one's own thoughts would revolutionize the subject (although that is what every barroom know-it-all believes). Professing one's adoration for this book only gives away one's ignorance."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"i used to wonder how anyone could fail to appreciate this book and the issues it covers. then i realized that the answer is right there in the work itself. Pirsig takes you beyond the world you're comfortable in, whether that be classical or romantic in nature.i cannot really describe how powerful the message of Zen is; read it for yourself. but it's definitely one of the greatest books i've ever read, along with the Tao Te Ching and Thus Spoke Zarathustra.read it, it's amazing."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"My favorite excerpts available at Z.M.M. is a deep and impressive work which has sold millions of copies and stayed in print in many languages for over twenty years. I recently read it for the first time. It was good to wait until I was ready for it. I am not sure I can recommend the book, but I am glad I experienced it.Mr. Pirsig presents the story of his search for the roots of deep philosophical views and his exploration of the branches of those views, from which branches hang all of the results Western civilization, not the least of which are universities, motorcycles, and mental hospitals. The philosophic system he proposes is to my knowledge unique and original, as well as marvelously free of endorsements or adherents.I am very interested in exploring how the models or paradigms in which all of us live lead to action. I did not explore Z.M.M. with a purpose of determining whether his system is true or even useful. I just like to know what the world looks like inside other people's heads. The world from inside his head looks wondrously intricate and interconnected, a world in which a man's motorcycle maintenance methods are determined by the intellectual in-fighting of ancient Greek philosophers. He is generous in the detail with which he shares pieces of his fertile and facile mind.The life he describes strikes me as sad and lonely, filled with failure and lacking in purpose. Measuring it against the three tenets of MayoGenuine (be genuine, be learning, be transitive) is illuminating. His great strength is his genuineness. He is also an intense learner in the traditional sense of accumulating knowledge and building systems, yet this information never seems to support him in taking the actions that would give him a satisfying life. His behavior does not alter, so learning in the sense in which I use the word does not occur. Most tragically, he seems highly isolated from human relationships, preferring the role of sage observer to participant or leader.

For me this book was one of those events. It is easy to get excited when reviewing a book that you particularly liked so colouring your review of it with overemphasised &quot;rhetoric&quot; which other people generally take with-a-pinch-of-salt anyway. The facts are that this was very good book. I didn't open the book looking for what other people had told me was there. I wasn't looking to agree or disagree with Persig I just 'listened'. His words were not so much a guide (as some people say) but more a key which unlocked a way of thinking clouded by modern society. Everybody has questions. I think the problem that alot of people have with this book is that they expect to be handed the answers by Persig. All I can say is read with an open mind and let this book be the catalyst to your own journey."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"Ignore the knobs below who gave it 1 star (it's probably the same guy anyway). Read it. It's not easy reading, but worth the effort. If you don't like to think too much or be challenged to much, skip it. Also, yes, much or most or all of it can be found in classic philosophical writings, but it's a fresh take and a very personal and powerful one."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"This book has been in the pop culture library for so long I decided it was time to see what the fuss was about.Based on reviews I expected an introduction to the author's philosophy propped up by a bit of story and anecdote. Instead, it's a very dense 400 pages of what amounts to ranting.I'm not a student of philosophy, so any concepts need to be presented to me in a simple and relatable format. In some cases Pirsig is successful in this attempt, using analogies (frequently involving motorcycles of course)to present his ideas. But these cases are few and far between. More often he simply invents a phrase and spends the next few pages expounding on his invention without any attempt to ground his ideas.And to speak from ignorance: he's not a very convincing philosopher. It starts off promising enough with a basic overview of the distinction between classic and romantic principles (though again, not being educated on the subject I have no idea how accurately he portrays this material) and the desire to unite these seemingly contradicting modes. As soon as his overarching concept of \\"Quality\\" is introduced as a means to that end however, everything goes downhill rapidly.\\"Quality\\" to Pirsig is a primal force which infuses, or perhaps even creates every internal and external event and allows us to instinctively sense worth, be it in a piece of art or the act of changing oil on a motorcycle. At least that could be a definition except for the fact that Pirsig's Quality theory is by his own admittance undefinable.His early test of this theory is to allow the class that he teaches to grade each others' work before exposing them to the knowledge necessary to intellectually evaluate the papers. Since the students' grading agrees with his own then surely this is evidence that we all have some sixth sense which allows us to interpret the intrinsic value of everything we perceive... Except at this point Pirsig admits that this experiment is invalidated by the number of variables and the possibility that his students might not represent a diversified enough sample to be statistically meaningful. He specifically states that a group of students with different backgrounds might have had a conflicting opinion of the Quality of their peer's essays.This does nothing to deter the protagonist (if he can be called that) of our story. He acknowledges the deficiencies of logic in his own theory yet does absolutely nothing to address them, unless you count the dismissal of logic as an argument (much like the lack of definition is used as a definition of Quality). Pirsig presents his hero as a genius of both scientific and philosophic rationality, yet he displays neither of these characteristics at any point in his \\"Chautauqua\\".Besides my gripes with the underlying message of the book there are plenty of other structural flaws with the work. The background story is just that: background, with little color or life to draw in the reader. The pacing is glacial at best, but since the plot is nearly nonexistent this may be considered moot. There is a spark of hope when the protagonist's dark past begins to unravel but that hope is quickly extinguished by the increasingly self righteous monologues. Apparently his serious mental illness should not be taken into consideration when you're listening to his ideas on the sum total of reality.In short: I would not recommend this book."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"Wow... where to begin. I can count on the fingers of one hand the number of books I've started but not finished. It's just not something I do. However, I quit on this book about half-way through. Some of the reasons were the author's fault; no doubt some were mine. I don't know that I was fully prepared for what this book ultimately is... a deep, drenching immersion into philosophy, metaphysics, quality of life, and personal self-worth. Writing about those things is a fine and admirable endeavor, but for me reading Pirsig's tortuous and complex prose just didn't work a majority of the time. He would sporadically grab me with a particular line of thought, only to veer off and lose me (interest-wise) for pages on end. I was far more attentive to the cross-country motorcycle trip than I was to his meandering &quot;Chautauqua&quot;. In the end what made me put this book down was that I just wasn't interested enough in the subject matter. So, before you begin this book be sure of what you've undertaken."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"In maintaining an active interest in philosophy I was quite eager to tackle this somewhat enigmatic work. This title is one of thos that you oft hear mentioned and rarely discussed. What I encoutnered was a pseudo-biographical work that presents it's ideas and concepts slowly, poorly and seemingly as condescendingly as possible. I would only advise those well versed in classical greek philosophy to even consider this text. The areas of the text pertaining to Zen Buddhism are very welcome and far to short ... even if the points made are rudimentary and well known today."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"I thought this book would be interesting and thoughtful but instead it seems to be more of the usual meism that permeated the Boomer generation and has so negatively affected my own generation. No wonder we're all screwed up!"},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"I noticed long ago that people who tend toward irrationalism usually cite Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance as their favorite book or \\"Bible.\\"Pirsig seems to have insight-fully taken note of some unsatisfactory outcomes of philosophy, but instead of identifying the problem and fixing it, he embraces the very sloppy reasoning that precipitated the errors he bemoans.Two stars because it is slightly more interesting than Heidegger, but isn't anywhere near to being in the same league as Wittgenstein."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"I got this book for my husband and he's making it through it. It's not an easy read but he hasn't given up yet!"},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance is a very difficult, but helpful book. Although it may not be the most exciting or entertaining story, the concepts discussed by Pirsig in this book are very helpful in learning many of life's important lessons. The way Pirsig approaches his ideas is also somewhat peculiar and confusing, yet he will always find a way to tie up any mixed up thoughts. He has an interesting outlook on how the concepts he explains pertain to almost every aspect of a person's life, and he uses them when performing maintenance on his motorcycle. On Robert and Chris Pirsig's journey across the country, they face their fair share of difficulties between each other that they must overcome. At the end of the book, Chris begins to see a split personality in Robert who is deeply taken by the teachings of Phadreus, an ancient philosopher. The conquering of this and many other troubles also teaches readers important lessons about people's relationships."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"Two stars! One for Pirsig putting pen to paper (all 514 dull pieces of them) and one for the apposite title. If Zen is patience, then I came damn close. What strength it took to not banish this book to my \`begun but not finished' bookshelf. A dull pontification on the definition of \`quality' (which is ironically lacking in the novel), and an unlikeable narrator who exemplifies the \`genius is madness' slogan. His philosophical ramblings are not profound, just disturbed. And hellishly boring."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"why this book became so popular i cant say. probably just because it has a great title. i hated it, but found myself giving it a second chance over and over again, because on paper im the exact target audience... until i actually couldnt take it anymore and left it 75% read. repetetive, prideful and not particularly deep."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"I've read many books but this one I didn't get. I've heard so many times that this book is a classic, yet when I read it--I just asked myself why? I must be missing something. It took me two weeks to complete the book and I couldn't wait to put it down. I can never put down a book once I begin it--even a bad book--so I was forced to read the whole thing. And when I finished I was so relived--no more burdens; no more pain. I was finnally done.There was so much detail of scenery; So many pages with words without substance. I got lost in the pages and couldn't wait to get out."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"This book seemed to ask a lot of questions yet give no real answers to them. Pirsig spends his time confused over a definition of 'quality' and yet he gives three within the main body of the book.The narratives between the philosophy, whilst relating, work more as light relief from the heavy-duty philosophy we are dealing with.Pirsig has some excellent ideas on University and education, however, if your looking for enlightenment. Don't expect much.Otherwise excellent."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"When I was first assigned to read this book, Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance seemed to have quite an intriguing title. I had heard from others who had previously read it that I would learn to hate this book. I tried to keep an open mind as I started reading this book, which proved to be very difficult throughout the remainder of it. The book was extremely long and confusing.It begins as Robert Pirsig takes his son, Chris, on a motorcycle trip from Minnesota to California. As they journey, Pirsig begins a Chautauqua, completely detailing everything around him. The reader would assume this is just a part of the story, perhaps adding a bit to the main plot. This is far from the truth. Pirsig tends to ramble on and on about the smallest details, especially Quality. In fact, the entire Part III is devoted to trying to describe an \\"indefinable\\" word. I can now say that I hate the word \\"quality\\" with a passion.Along with his analysis of Quality, Pirsig attempts to explain the ideas of many great Greek philosophers, including Socrates and Plato. A person would have to have a basic knowledge of their philosophies to understand most of this. I, on the other hand, know very little and was lost the majority of the time. Because of this, I would not recommend Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance to anyone not wanting a difficult read or anyone else for that matter. I'd keep a dictionary, and maybe an encyclopedia, nearby just in case."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"I am now glad I actual slogged through this book for one reason only. It now solidifies my belief that if a book is getting god awful no matter HOW much of it I have read, I should quit. I wish I did that after the first 100 pages.Pirsig's novel contains so many things that make reading a chore, or just flat out PAINFUL. This isn't a story it's a screed. This book should have been chopped in more than half consisting of a short story of maybe 100 pages. You are constantly bombarded by intellectual/philosophical meanderings that go nowhere. Not only do they go nowhere they are bone dry dull, mindnumbingly deadening, add NOTHING to the story, and are just flat out ridiculous.Here is how the book reads, pages and pages of blah blah blah blah (repeat for 50 pages)... I get off the bike and change the oil. blah blah blah blah blah blah... we are heading West now. blah blah blah blah.In fact the book is just about the opposite of everything good books are suppose to be. This book is, plotless, boring, dry, longwinded, pretentious, dull, unfocused, an ego trip for the author, shall I go on???? Seriously this reads like the longest most boring academic paper on the most deranged subject you could think of. How could you even care about the characters in this book after reading these abhorrent passages that in the end really say nothing. I am glad I skimmed the last 10 chapters and only read the passages that contained dialogue. Seriously if you did that you could read this book and understand this story in less than 4/5ths the time it takes to read all the tripe.I suggest you drive nails through your skull seriously it's less painful than reading this dreck."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"I am an avid reader and consider myself fairly intelligent. I was excited to receive this book as a present since I heard so many wonderful things about it. The person who gave it to me said I would find myself referring back to it every 5 years of my life.Maybe it is me, but this book did not enlighten me. I made through 60 pages and realized it was just not the book for me. I found it long winded and I kept asking myself why I felt the need to go on.I finally had to good sense to stop. I felt like I was reading something written by an insane person that was projecting his own reality onto the world."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"I just finished the book a minute ago and I feel a little better about it having reached the end. I have mixed feelings about the book. The plot is interesting in the way that Pirsig slowly reveals the story of Phaedrus and develops a conflict between the narrator and his former self. I felt driven to carry on with the book because I wanted to see what happened with Phaedrus and how he would resurface in the story. But as other reviewers have pointed out this part of the story only accounts for a small percentage of the book. The rest is devoted to Pirsig's philosophy.Pirsig's long-winded rhetorical musings were much harder to get through than the story itself. I am a philosopher of sorts that identifies with Zen and Taoism and for this reason was attracted to this book. Pirsig's philosophy falls short of both of these eastern religions, however. I personally did not agree with his arguments and that made the book less appealing to me. Pirsig denounces the classic philosophers but at the same time is a tool to the same powers as they were. Instead of denouncing the ideas of truth and quality he seeks to define them. Any good Zen student knows that a man who polarizes the world with concepts like good and bad is not on the path to enlightenment. Pirsig, like the classic philosophers, views the world through the biased eyes of men instead of removing himself from the common persons way of thought.Pirsig's philosophical parts of the book were long, boring and not something I could personally identify with. Pirsig makes important points about our values and important social commentary but I feel he did not go far enough. He makes it seem like Phaedrus has made a huge step out of classical human thought and is driven mad by this but I feel he is still too traditional in his interpretation of the world. This is not a story of Zen philosophy; it is a story by a man whose vision is stilled clouded by the Wheel of Things.This book has its virtues but 400 pages would not be needed to reproduce them in an equally successful book."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"I found this book barely worthwhile. I started reading it largely due to its fame and impressive selling history. I'm sorry to say it was an unsatisfying exercise, one that towards the end I was doing just to see if there was some climactic ending (which there was not). The entire book takes place on a cross-country motorcycle ride that Pirsig takes with his son Chris, accompanied early on by two friends.The first half of Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance is fairly engaging. The last half is exceedingly boring and inscrutable. Pirsig goes on ad nauseum into the abstraction of \\"quality\\"; he's obsessed with it. He does not however (as far as I can tell) clearly define the term as he uses it. It's ostensibly not the conventional \\"quality\\" we're accustomed to. Regardless, I found myself reading only the first sentence of many paragraphs as he went on and on about the subject. He spent at least 100 pages of the last half of the book delving into his thought process many years ago. I found these sections of void of cogent points on anything other than his emerging insanity.It seems Pirsig used the title as marketing more than an indicator of the content, as there are few sections on Zen or the accompanying values. It's safe to assume Pirsig took his personal journal of his motorcycle riding and published it, giving little thought to wrapping the ideas he had together into a unified theme.His relationship with his accompanying son, Chris, was a source of frustration. The kid is apparently psychologically unstable, which is perfectly expectable given his father.I find myself wondering why this book is as successful as it is; perhaps I missed whatever value millions of readers have found in this book. While the first half was mildly worthwhile, the remainder left a sour taste in this reader's mouth."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"As an aspiring novelist with a degree in english and philosophy, I find it disheartening to find philosophy lectures thinly disguised as novels (Lila, Sophie's World -- could that title have slyly been borrowed from Sophie's Choice?). Also, Persig, in his so-called quest, refuses to acknowledge such modern philosophers as Nietzche, Kierkegaard, Sartre, Camus, or even Rand. He also doesn't attempt to create a synthesis between eastern and western philosophy, as the title would suggest. Herman Hesse, for example, does manage an intriguing blend of eastern mysticism with western philosophy -- he is greatly influence by Nietzsche. Persig's prose is often flat, but his protagonists are very driven in their quest for metaphysical quality. But as characters, they don't -- for me, seem very interesting. If the reader is interested in the philosophical novel, may I suggest reading Sartre, Camus, Hesse, Rand, Mann, Dostoievsky, or Tolstoi."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"A very overrated book by college proffesors and other pseudo intellectuals, but nevertheless it makes a good fiction book."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"I am usually very open to new concepts and different ideas that people have on different things. This thought process applied when my English teacher assigned us to read Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance. I began reading this book thinking and hoping it would get better. I was dreaming. This is one of the worst books that I've ever read. It was lengthy and tiresome. I think that it was unexciting because I didn't have a clue what Robert Pirsig was talking about over half of the time. I didn't agree with him on hardly any of his views and could not relate to him at all. To make matters worse, he had to pull his son into the mess. I think that he was a terrible father who was too busy worrying about himself. He hardly ever talked to his son and when he did, it was either meaningless mumbo jumbo or very pessimistic. I'm not exactly sure what the main message of the book was, therefore, the book itself was quite pointless. I would recommend that you not waste your time and effort trying to tackle this book."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"This was great!

I felt as if the story that this book had to tell could have been told in 200 pages, maybe. I'm not sure why the book had to drag on for so long.I'll grant this to the people who think that this book is the greatest thing since sliced bread: the discussion of Quality was a good thing that Pirsig brought up, but it went on for far too long. Before long, I was so sick of Quality that I would probably have burned the book after Quality was next mentioned. After the discussion of Quality finally came to a close (the end of the book), I was so confused by what Quality actually was that I now start to wonder what Quality actually is.The rest of the book also proved confusing. I won't try to blind myself to the fact that this was a tough read. I consider myself a very intelligent person, and I had to read and re-read passages and then re-read them again before I could really understand what in the world Pirsig was trying to say. Maybe this would have been a better book if Pirsig had used a slightly less complicated vocabulary and tried to better explain Quality, but Pirsig didn't do this.The main reason not to read Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance is because Pirsig does too much to confuse the readers."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"I was required to read this book for an ethics class in college.

I think the reason why this book is so popular is because it grounds the intense philosophical challenges of \\"quality\\" with a very real personal story and honest, soulful attitude. The reader can feel close to Pirsig's narrator, despite some esoteric and sometimes mysterious images.

All of this is mostly in the first half, the second half is centered more on hardcore philosophical points, and the author's concept of Quality.

He explains where western philosophy went wrong, the split between Plato and Aristotle, how and where that arose. And he does so in easy to understand, exciting prose.

If you want a summary of the books contents that has been given in the editorial review and the review just below mine. I have chosen to write about what the book meant to me. The thing about the book that amazed me so much is the way that it was able to take hold of my mind for hours at a time and lead me in diferent philosophical directions. It was like having a long philosophical discussion with myself and not even realizing it and it really reminded me of some guided meditations I've been on (only with a great deal more substance). To me, this book is required reading for anyone who considders themselves an intellectual or any lover of philosophy (especially metaphysics).

I feel like I'm on that motorcycle and enjoying the scenery and the people. I'm only half-way through the book, but I can feel his remoteness from life. His philosophical musings are also enjoyable, despite the fact that reading philosophy was always difficult for me, I enjoy them because they are succinct. Pirsig seems to live in an abstract world despite the fact that he concentrates on nuts and bolts and what he calls Reality. He seems to be asking for answers to those most basic questions of what life is all about, in fact struggling with those questions, but missing what I understand of Zen from the koans I have heard, for example- Student: Master, what is the meaning of life? Master: have you had breakfast yet? My guess is that it is this struggle which led to his psychotic break and this book is his attempt to understand why he had the breakdown by returning to where it occurred. Maybe in the second half of the book, he resolves this struggle. I'll edit this review when I have finished the book (if I am still sane then).I just finished the book. Throughout it I enjoyed his descriptions of the ride through the scenery and his interactions with his son, like being taken on such a trip with my young son. His examining his philosophical questions became rather wearing, but for some reason I always wanted to see what he said next, even though in the end I really didn't know what the heck he was talking about. I simplified his question about 'quality' for myself by telling myself that his conclusion was no different than Polonius' To thine own self be true and it must follow as the night the day, thou canst not then be false to any man. The question of whether gravity existed before the universe did (I really don't recall this part too well) I concluded was a ridiculous question and to me it is obvious that one cannot separate one from the other and that gravity does not exist in the same way that the universe does as it is merely a relationship of parts of the universe to each other.On thinking over the book, I was reminded of one of the first psychotic patients I saw. I tried so hard to understand what he was trying to say that I came to the realization that if I didn't stop thinking about it I would drive myself crazy. Then in the afterword of the book which he wrote ten years later, he writes \\"I tend to become taken with philosophic questions, going over and over them ...until...they become psychiatrically dangerous ... and now the question became obsessive (of)'Where did he (Chris, after he died) go?' I also became obsessed with this question after my father died.Bottom line for me on this book is: 1) the motorcycle ride with his son is an enjoyable read, 2) the philosophical stuff is ultimately incomprehensible, and 3) the book seems to be an attempt to understand himself and his psychosis. I think he was compelled to write this thing just like Willem de Koonig was compelled to paint the way he did, but with regard to producing something useful such as Newton's outlining his laws of motion, I would call this book a failure."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"Really is very important to remember to smell the roses..the joy is in the journey.

The book was exactly what I expected."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"Many years ago a chap, who I am glad to report is now my brother-in-law, was prescribed this book as a Stage 1 Engineering pre-read. He took one look at the cover and gave it to me, at that point a pubescent teenager grappling with the existential difficulties of the world which suddenly were presenting themselves (I'm still grappling with them now, come to think of it).\\"Here,\\" he said, \\"you might have more use for this than me\\". He probably meant it as a joke.Well, I had a go - I would guess this was about 1983 - and I still recall Robert M Pirsig's vivid account of the bright, hot sweep of the prairies from the saddle of motorcycle, his ruminations on how to tell if your tappets need realigning, and him rabbiting on about travelling circuses called \\"chautauquas\\" and this mysterious Phaedrus character.I can't have got the whole way through because, as the journey arcs across the midwest to San Francisco, the personal story becomes more intense and the philosophy far more technical than a hormonally confused 13 year old could reasonably have stayed with.Recently I've found a copy and re-read it. Pirsig's fascination with the orient feels a little dated (if not glib) but it's still a clever, original and thought-provoking book, though mostly for the narrative structure rather than the philosophical content. As we read on we are presented with uncomfortable chapters in Pirsig's history. We find that Phaedrus is in fact an earlier rendition of Pirsig himself; a child genius and a tenured academic at an early age who, spurred by his own existential search for \\"quality\\", drove himself mad. He had a psychotic episode and was only brought out of it with electro-shock therapy. As we meet him, the rehabilitated Pirsig has left academia, writes technical manuals for IBM (a low-stress job if ever there were one) and has just embarked on a pan-American motorcycle tour with his son, Chris, whom he fears also may have psychiatric issues, and another couple whom he doesn't seem much to like.It is not explained why they are riding across America, other than as a vacation (and as a vacation it sounds super: I've wanted to do the same ever since) yet, as he leaves the other couple behind, it becomes clear that Pirsig is wantonly stirring up some old ghosts as he goes, riding directly into the dark heart of Phaedrus' old life and Chris is his unwitting, and increasingly unwilling, accomplice.Along the way Pirsig engages in these Chautauquas, expounding a theory of \\"quality\\" which, it emerges, is assembled from his fragmented recollections of Phaedrus' own homespun epistemology, once obliterated by the shock treatment but now slowly being uncovered and pieced together as he ventures westward. This is, of course, precisely the philosophy that engulfed and eventually sent Phaedrus insane, so this, with its obvious parallels to pioneering ventures into the wild west, is a powerful literary device.This narrative structure remains fresh; Pirsig's - or perhaps Phaedrus' - philosophy feels a little more shopworn: some of the ground he covers has been fought over bitterly in the subsequent forty years, and while Pirsig's complaints about analytical and Platonic realism ring true, his attempts to cure them with an appeal to a pre-intellectual, undefinable, \\"quality\\" - a valiant attempt, I think, to avoid veering into the roadside ditch of relativism - don't really carry the day (those who have read some of my other reviews will know I don't see a big problem with the roadside ditch). Pirsig's arguments get more strident and technical, but no more compelling, as Phaedrus's personality begins to reassert itself, and as the book enters its last quarter we get into fairly intricate analysis and critique of Plato's dialogues. These have been more lightly dispatched by the likes of Popper and Feyerabend, and Pirsig's alternative (refusing as it does to define its central tenet) lacks any real utility that I could make out.For all this the book never outstays its welcome: Pirsig is canny enough to interleave the philophical musings with the beauty of the American wilderness and an alarming descent towards the psychiatrically unknown.In its erudition, imagination and breath of coverage Zen and The Art of Motorcycle Maintenance deserves a place, perhaps further down the rostrum, amongst Philosophy's notably \\"left field\\" classics such as Julian Jaynes'The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind, Paul Feyerabend'sAgainst Method, and even Friedrich Nietzsche'sThus Spake Zarathustra.The years have passed: my brother-in-law's eldest son is now currently reading engineering at University. I think I had better return the favour and send him a copy.Olly Buxton"},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"Robert M. Pirsig's classic novel is a mix of engaging storytelling and an exploration of how classical Greek philosophy drove the growth of Western civilization; we have mastered the physical world but at the cost of spiritual growth. Those more knowledgeable in philosophy may quibble with his premise, but to me he seems to be one the first modern novelists to advocate taking God out of the temple and recognize that spiritual wholeness was inside us all along.Story: The book intertwines three stories; the first follows a college professor struggling to become whole again after a devastating psychotic breakdown. His story provides structure and context for a lengthy introduction to the growth of Western philosophy and what we have gained and sacrificed as a result. The third story details his attempts to reconnect with his son after his breakdown shattered his family. The blend of engaging story, philosophical introduction, and spiritual journey is why the book has endured as a classic philosophical/new age novel for the last quarter-century (this is my overview).Spiritual/metaphysical content: Medium. Pirsig's theme explores Quality and Truth with a capital T. Interestingly, he equates Quality to God only twice in the book (Chapters 21 and xx), and he implies that the reconciliation of Quality and Truth results in Zen but never explicitly states that point. However, in my opinion that's the driving force behind the work--the need for Western civilization to get back to a state of spiritual wholeness, enlightenment, God, Zen, dharma--the words don't matter. Perhaps it was necessary in the early 1970s to use the terms of classical philosophy in order to be taken seriously, but the core message of the book is clear: We a lost a part of our soul by embracing Western philosophy. Western civilization has gained mastery over the world, but \\"lost the ability to be a part of the world and not an enemy of it.\\"Although Pirsig sidesteps the effect of religion on Western development, I feel this fracturing of our world view was exacerbated by the spread of Christianity. People were encouraged to stop looking inside of themselves for truth and let the Church direct their spiritual growth and define their values and ethics. I'm not certain, but Pirsig may have been one of the first 20th-century American novelists to popularize the notionthat Western thought took a wrong turn more than 2,300 years ago and that exploring Eastern philosophy may help fill a spiritual void for many people.My take: I'll admit, the rhetorical sections were a hard slog at times. I felt like I was reading a doctoral candidate's dissertation without the footnotes. However, I learned a great deal about Western philosophy and how we got to where we are as a society. Greek philosophers, primarily Aristotle, moved away from the idea of wholeness and individual excellence - Quality - toward dividing the way we see the world into mind and matter, which enabled Western cultures to master the realm of matter. However, spiritual growth was sacrificed to technological innovation; we a lost a part of our soul by embracing Western philosophy. Despite the dense philosophical sections, I loved the book 20 years ago, and after rereading it I still love it today. The blend of engaging story, great writing, philosophical exploration, and spiritual journey is why the book has endured as a classic new age novel for the last quarter-century."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"Reading \\"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance\\" require great peace of mind. This book was clearly the work of a a passionate author, who was given the well-disguised gift of hundreds of rejections from publishers -- that forced him to refine his text, to clarify his ideas, to remove all that was unnecessary, until what remains is as raw distillation of ideas that almost magically is also engrossing.As an aside, the book parallels my life in many ways. I was first introduced to it while my father was reading it, on a long, slow trip through the upper midwest, following much the same route that Pirsig describes. Later, reading it for the first time in college, I read it a few pages at a time over a few months, much as Pirsig describes reading Walden to his son. I myself was given the well disguised gift of being kicked out of school, forced to work for a few years, then returned to school with all the fire and enthusiasm of the student described in the middle of the book. Finally, my work is in computer-generated visual effects in movies, you could not find a career that more closely models the classic/romantic split that is ZAMM.There are so many things about the book that I love, but what is common to all of them is that it encourages you to step outside your little world-view, and ask foundational questions. So much of what passes for society these days depends on everybody coming to the consensus answer to these questions that nobody even recognizes that the questions exist anymore. When the author says (paraphrasing) when somebody says something doesn't make sense -- maybe the problem is with the \\"sense\\", maybe the problem is with reason itself? When Pirsig describes Euclidian geometry as \\"convenient\\" rather than \\"true\\", it literally knocked me off my feet. Over and over within the book there are these sucker-punches, these short phrases that when you stop and think of them, are absolutely devastating. (Of course, the narrator is sucker-punched exactly the same way by his secretary, and just barely survives -- clearly not a coincidence.)Looking back on this book today, one thing that strikes me is the reversal of roles with respect to science and technology. Back in his day (especially as he was writing the book in the late sixties, early seventies) there was a war between the science-loving engineering squares, and the hippies who just wanted to \\"dig it, man\\". And today, if you look at the politics of science, it's the hippies who are promoting science (espeically environmental science, but really all science) and the squares who are rejecting it. Reading this book is the best introduction to the scientific method that I can imagine.One of the review-quotes at the beginning of my edition said that \\"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance is one Harley of a book\\"; that's a better summation than I could do myself. Read it. And then read it again. Then give the copy to somebody else who needs it."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"I've been a bit disappointed in this book, given the number of stellar recommendations I've heard. My main disappointment is in the careless logic that's presented--unverifiable generalizations that the author expects you to accept as true, even without support. And if you don't accept them as true, then the following generalizations are meaningless. (As a quick example, opening to a random page: \\"You are never dedicated to something you have complete confidence in.\\" This is an absolute statement that simply cannot be proved, yet he expects you to accept it and builds further arguments upon it.) He's built a house of cards out of cards that are ripped or torn, and if you examine one card too closely, the whole house falls down.I'm also extremely put off by the way the main character treats his son in the book. He's somewhat kind to him, but he refuses to communicate with him on a serious level and very often cuts him off because he's \\"too tired\\" to talk, and then wonders and whines about his \\"lack of connection\\" with his son. Please. . . .All in all, an interesting book, but far too long and very weak on logic. If I were to use it in a classroom, I'd use it to demonstrate how easy it is to tear apart a supposedly logical argument that's built on sand, not stone."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"I had heard of \\"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance\\" by Robert Pirsig long before I read it. But when someone compared some of my emails on Postfix mail servers to this book, I had to read it. I am glad I did.The one mistake people make with this book is thinking it has to deal with zen and motorcycle maintenance. It has little to do with either, but under the author's name, in the sub title, the truth is exposed.Pirsig's work is not some giant philosophical leap forward. In fact, there are many earlier works that cover the same material as Pirsig's with far more detail and accuracy! But where they fail to make things digestible to a layman, Pirsig succeeds.That is perhaps the one bad thing in \\"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance.\\" He has made some mistaken quotes by simple mis-remembering, and hands them out as accurate information. But even this is not terrible when you look at the overall goal of the book, to inspire people to examine quality in their lives.I think that this book should be required reading in every high school. There is a lot in there that people coming of age need to learn, and so rarely do. The allegorical examination of quality through the tools of Zen and Motorcycles is very wonderfully written. And with a teacher to correct the few misquotes, even the down side can be eliminated.Now while I feel that Pirsig's viewpoint is somewhat polarized, I do not find that hinders the learning process or enjoyment involved in reading this book.So please, read this book, even if you are interested in philosophy, zen, motorcycles, or quality. You may be surprised about the other parts of your life that it touches on."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"For a long time, I struggled with finding religion. I wasn't raised as anything, Christian Jew or otherwise. Eastern religions have held the most appeal for me, since I am an intellectual type. However, this book is good for reasons beyond the mundane. If you enjoy thinking about abstract concepts, and second-guessing deep-rooted beliefs about what life is and why we're here, this book is for you."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"Great book recommended by a professor I took a class with almost a decade ago. Finally got around to picking it up and it definitely lived up to my expectations (and my professor's recommendation)."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"Just finished reading Robert Pirsig's \\"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance\\". Its an oldie from \\"back in the day\\" when I was a sophmore in college in 1974. Its is a worthwhile read and Mr. Pirsig is a gifted writer with brilliant insights into human thought,reasoning,logic, emotions,feelings, our foibles,sadness,joy,what does it all mean,discussing a 3rd option as an answer to a yes/no question etc.I too rode on a motorcycle- a Honda 175 a bit around rural America- much much less than Mr. Pirsig- upstate NY, Maine Quebec and Vermont mostly, around the same time as him. For him it was around 1968, for me 1974-5, and his descriptions of the small towns I experienced are authentic , resonating and mirrored my own .There is much in this book that is difficult to put into words other than to say it is gentle, honest and authentic.I will say though that as another reviewer observed , to me, Mr. Pirsig appears trapped within the context of his own world view as he shows in his sometimes obliviousness to the fact that his 11 year old son has not come to the same conclusions about philosophy and life as his dad despite the fact that his son is 11 years old. As a parent with 2 sons on the mildest end of the autistic spectrum, at least in my humble opinion Mr. Pirsig's character seems to lack some of the knack of \\"getting it\\" as far as dealing with he emotions of others. Its not for me to say, but perhaps he had a very mild form of Aspbergers Syndrome, which of course was not diagnosed back then.In a sense this book is autobiographical as many of the events in it parallel events in Mr. Pirsig's real life. One can see that the power dynamic male/female was vastly different then. Likewise medicine ,diet and many other things have for the most part and for many people gotten better from 1974-2010 here in the USA.At the same time, while reading this please be mindful that in real life Mr. Pirsig comes from the US upper classes. His dad was a law school dean and he was/is ? a professor at a college. Keep this in mind because these advantages of birth /good fortune? along with a 170 IQ and some ambition too-to have given him the leisure time to take a many week motorcycle trip across the western half of the USA while millions of less fortunate folks , get a paid week off per year if lucky, toiled at unrewqarding jobs to put food on the table and keep a roof over the heads of themselves and their families.Being mindful of all this people of all walks of life can benefit, enjoy and learn from this book . Although this book is far more upbeat, it shares a quality with the Academy Award winning movie of 1969; \\"They Shoot Horses Don't They\\", in that this movie and this book, once read or viewed will change your view of things forever."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"a book that everyone should read... It is all about how life works... if u let it..."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"There's one point in this book where the narrator says that unlike Phaedrus, he doesn't believe in Quality as a monist principle to life, and he neither believes in the Aristotlian view of Truth as the single principle to life. Quality is dubbed for romantic reality, Truth is dubbed for classical reality, and so the dualism between form and function becomes the overriding principal inquiry of the story. Pirsig, in his afterword to the edition I read, identifies the crux of the story as an attempt to reconcile technology and nature, but I don't sense that reconciling these two facets of our world is as culturally relevant as he claims. I wasn't born during this time, so I can't say if the cultural climate of the mid-70s really sensed this culture-bearing theme that Pirsig has defined to be relevant to this era. Technology and nature seem to play minor roles to the major theme of dualism in the story: between materialism and perspectivism, which can also be stated as objectivism and subjectivism, or metaphysics and physics, or as, Pirsig calls it, classicalism (Truth; Reason) and romanticism (Quality; Excellence.)Phaedrus claims that Quality is more significant than Truth, that romanticism is more significant than logic, that the world is run by Quality as an overriding principal that guides humanity and the world. But quality lacks definition and Pirsig and Phaedrus are painfully aware of this. Instead of defining it, Phaedrus breaks apart reason as being historically manipulative ever since the rejection of the Sophists and the emergence of Aristotle, who broke away with the monist principle of quality with specialization, categorization, and stultifying soul-crushing reason. Phaedrus rejects the ideas of reason as the overall goal of humanity, but he tantrums against it like a child. At first read, it seems that Phaedrus is saying that reason is inadequate in pursuing truth. But when I continued reading, I realized Phaedrus really believed that reason is an off-shoot of Quality; which is excellence. But what is quality really... how can it be defined, not described? It can't, and so there's a conflict between Quality and Truth.I find that the conflict is best resolved by the idea of Harmony. With Harmony, Quality and Reason, objectivity and subjectivity, Truth and Excellence are united, and therein lies the holy trinity of dualism: the synthesis between the subjective and objective-- Harmony. Pirsig seems to have really made an important realization at this point of the story/inquiry, but the realization is sadly left behind, and again we have to endure the obsession with Quality and the tearing down of Truth which is later expanded upon with Phaedrus's personal narrative in college-- his championing the Sophists and denouncing Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle. Phaedrus's narrative is interesting and provides a historical background for this infinite debate, but does not answer the inquiry which Pirsig pursues. It is Harmony that is most impressive to me, not Phaedrus's insistent cry for Quality and immature subversion of the Establishment, which he dubs, 'The Church of Reason.' Phaedrus wants to be celebrated so much, he doesn't see the faults of his own views. Quality is a vague word and doesn't do half as good a job describing the philosophy of life as Harmony does.Here is a passage on page 273 that really seems to answer the major philosophical debate for me:\\"It is not the facts but the relation of things that results in the universal harmony that is the sole objective reality. What guarantees the objectivity of the world in which we live is that this world is common to us with other thinking beings. Through the communications we have with other men we receive from them ready-made harmonious reasonings. We know that these reasonings do not come from us and at the same time we recognize in them, because of their harmony, the work of reasonable beings like ourselves. And as these reasonings appear to fit the world of our sensations, we think we may infer that these reasonable beings have seen the same thing as we; thus it is that we know we haven't been dreaming. It is this harmony, this quality if you will, that is the sole basis for the only reality we can ever know.\\"This passage is enlightening in consideration of its context, which is the human, subjectivist tendency to select the facts around us. Our selection determines our reality. When our selection is not harmonious with others, then our reality becomes questionable. Until Einstein can demonstrate the Theory of Relativity (which I won't pretend to understand), it was only a theory. Only after it is \\"accepted\\" and harmoniously received by others, can it become known as a reality as we know it. Which brings a good segue into a major concept in the narrative: mental illness. This is exactly what mental illness is. When someone's mind is disharmonious with that of the world around him, he goes insane.This contention also brings to light the idea of Value. It is the selection of facts and society's acceptance of those facts that defines Value, and I think this is what Pirsig means by the subtitle, 'An Inquiry into Value'. Harmony seems to me as the great lesson that is taught in this unwieldy, exhilarating, experimentally complex, and awesome book. Not Quality."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"I rarely reread books, especially those that didn't fascinate me initially. As a 20-year old, three decades ago, this book unmoved me. A philosophical inquiry disguised as a road trip? Life seemed too short to ask so many questions.Ah, but time and the maturity it hopefully creates have a way of changing one's focus. As a parent and one who's faced much more life, I found a rereading of this book to be illuminating.Pirsig cleverly intertwines the parallel stories of his attempts to come to terms with his troubled son; the encounters with his troubled former self termed Phaedrus; and finally his life-long inquiries into integrating the rational and artistic aspects of our souls and the search for the overarching Quality which gives meaning to our lives.Is he successful? In terms of showing that a better life is one that is examined, and that the questions asked are more useful than any answer - yes. Impatient readers and those demanding certain answers will be disappointed.This is not a perfect book - it appears to be written from notes taken during the road trip, as opposed to firmly polished final work. The narrator has a certainty that can be grating. And the cult-like popularity is hard to fathom. Perhaps its timing and mis-labeling as a 'New-Age' book helped.Still, it has made me spend time examining not only my values, now and past, but my relationship with my son. With respect to the latter, Pirsig's son's tragic death following the close of the book only underscores the need to best live your life while you can."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"probably the most over-hyped book of all time....i like practical books..check out Live Like A Fruit Fly - also on amazon"},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"At first the book goes back and forth and it can seem dull or uninteresting at times. However, if you stick with it you see the forest instead of the trees and really appreciate the character development. The intriguing moral story behind it all is thought-provoking, relevant, and deeply personal to everyone.I have already recommended this book to three people, and whether or not you like philosophy, fiction, self improvement, or anything thought-provoking you will enjoy and benefit from this book.Absolutely worth keeping this one around!"},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"There are many things to like about this book. It is thought provoking, it contains some excellent insights, and the pace of the story works for the subject matter. Overall, at the end of the book, I was a bit disappointed because Pirsig didn't wrap things up as well as thought he should've, but I still give it five stars because the work is thought-provoking and well written. Unlike most novels which leave me cold, this one is chock full of philosophical ideas and questions that are important and worth pondering.

The whole quality thing boggles the mind and leaves your mind full of questions, which is what I like out of a book, as long as they are not questions on what the book was trying to say. If you're thinking about reading this, I would recomend reading it slowly and with lots of patience, because it is worth it."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"I think that ideally this book should be read on a long, important and challenging journey.

The book forces you to pay attention and to think; to reflect on the direction of our society and our culture, and to question if it is a good direction. Pirsig does an excellent job in not preaching, but telling a wonderful story, and uses the story as a tool to introduce and expand upon his philosophy and the zen philosophy.

Excellent book to read aloud with teenagers. The best book ever written.Note: The current editions have an afterword, written years after the original publication of the book.

If I hadn't been forced to read Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, I would have probably only read around the first twenty pages and put it down. There were many concepts in the book I didn't understand at all. There was one idea about quality that was pretty interesting at first. If you think about the term quality long enough, you start realizing you can't put a concrete definition to it. After awhile though, the author kept questioning quality and what it was which made it very long and drawn out. Many people actually liked the book, but the ideas he talked about were way over my head. I almost felt like I was wasting my time reading the book because I did not understand so much of what I was reading. The whole setting of him riding on his motorcycle with his son was actually pretty interesting and how there was conflict between their relationship because the author was fighting a battle with himself and his other half, Phaedrus. If you are an avid reader though and like a challenge then I would recommend this book to you. If not, don't read this book."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"The gumption traps caught me. An honest book. A true book.

Rather than discussing the plot, other reviewers like to talk about the tingly feeling this book gives them. The reason why the other reviewers do not discuss the plot is because it is paper thin, despite the 400 page thickness of the book. After reading the book, I am hard pressed to explain what it is about.I realize this book is intended to be a philosophical exploration of the modern world, but I just can not see it. The main character uses his motorcycle as his metaphor for life. Just as things go wrong in life, motorcycles malfunction. Each person has a unique approach to fixing the problem. The main character's problem is his strained relationship with his son. Together, they travel cross country via motorcycle, enduring the quirks in each other's personality and enjoying some beautiful scenery. This story is about 30% of the book. In the rest of the book, the main character explores fantasy/his alter ego while discussing philosophy and all of the great philosohers. If you did not enjoy reading this type of literature in your college philosophy class, reading these passages will feel like a trip to the dentist.While the coming of age story and father and son bonding stories are readable, I would hardly call this book \\"one of the most profound best sellers of our time\\".

There are moments when the book is more of a narrative, but by and large, it's a philosophy book in the guise of fiction. It's much higher quality than something like The Celestine Prophecy, but not exactly unlike it in the way it wants you to see the world in a different way.I got 2/3 through it and that's all.

It is the story of a man, who at one time was in a mental hospital, traveling across country with his son on a motorcycle remembering the time that led to his break down. He was, before the break down, a anti-social misfit that passes time questioning everything not for answers but to prove everyone wrong. Then more that half way through the book he decides to ask what is quality? Not a soul stretching question, once he becomes fixed on finding the answer he destroys any quality his family once had. This is not an important book. It is only the story of a selfish man that puts himself above all else in his life. I can see where most of the baby boomers, that believed the &quot;Do for you&quot; &quot;Put your needs first&quot; type of psycho babble, probably thought this book was important.

Add to that that he is a very meticulous/rhetorical guy, and you get a lot of droning.3. Throw in sappy storytelling of the kind... 'well this is where my pen landed, it has to be included'... and you may just find yourself annoyed fairly often.What's good? So far his classic/romantic constructs are pretty interesting.

Yes--but so did Philosophy 101, and I don't think there's anything in here that wasn't covered there. Phil. 101 also had the advantage of being narrated by a cute TA, not a guy whose mental illness makes him think he is brilliant, unique, tragically misunderstood, and that others are only worth listening to when they are feeding his insatiable ego. Now, if you look at it as a peek inside the mind of a schizophrenic, it's interesting on that level. Having grown up with one, it was interesting to see the patterns (just like no one who believes in reincarnation says they were a peasant in a former life--no, they were all Cleopatra--no schizophrenic is just mentally ill, they're all wildly brilliant and misunderstood because the whole rest of the world is too stupid to understand them...ask them, they'll tell you). So if you're looking for deep, unique philosophy, read somebody off the Phil. 101 reading list--but if you think philosophy from the inside of the head of someone who is mentally ill and in complete denial might be interesting, give this one a shot."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"Perhaps the most overrated book in pop culture.

It must be rewarding to finish it, but I am afraid I will never get there because it's just not worth my time."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"This is one of those books I always thought I should read and when I finally got around to it I was blown away. I am reminded of catcher in the rye and one... cuckoos nest. This book was not what I expected. It is not about motorcycles or philosophy, it is about people. The story is skillfully woven between these elements. This is not a book you read once. This is not a book though, to escape from thinking. If that's what you need try Matthew Riley."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"This book weaves together a story about a motorcycle journey, commencing in the Midwest and ending along the California coast, with a \\"Chautauqua\\" - an inquiry into values, which delves into Western philosophy in a way that intends practical consequences. The journey west on a motorcycle is mythic in a sense, drawing comparison to going West a century ago or going West today, thirty years after this book was written. The journey also involves a rather harrowing kind of story: of a man trying his best to fit his life together in order to guide his young son through a particularly crucial and troubling time.Some reviewers see the Chautauqua part of the book as excessive reflection and even condescending. That may be true as far as their point of view is concerned. But for all the abstraction in this purported novel, it does have a great deal of clarity; the ideas are compelling; and it is relatively straightforward and not that difficult to follow. Abstract thought is the predilection of the narrator, and he struggles with himself to find a basis in Western thought that will help him come to grips with the whirling pace of technological change in modern life. Eastern thought comes into play as a kind of crystallization of his ideas. The word \\"Zen\\", as it is used here, is a catch word that refers to an Eastern point of view - a way of being or orienting toward the world that unites subject and object and centers on the word \\"Quality\\".In my opinion, this book is as timely as ever. The narrator begins the Chautauqua by noting the difficulties that people with a romantic point of view, such as the DeWeeses, have in adapting to the complications of technology. Thirty years ago, it seems to me, people like the DeWeeses - romantics who rebelled against technology - had a stronger voice than they do today. Today, technology has become so much more pervasive, and the opportunities to evade technology so significantly fewer, that their voices now are being drowned out. To me, finding a way to adapt to technology and still remain a whole person, who has not given up on the pursuit of \\"Quality\\", is a very compelling pursuit."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"I read this book several times over the years and each time I get something new out of it. I'm a Christian and though this book derives some of its underpinnings from Eastern philosopy, the book gives a great overview of Western civilization. How the book uses geography, the personal relationships, his past history, and Greek and Eastern philosophy to prove his thesis is fascinating. The book has problems. The main character does not follow his own philosophy in some ways. Pirsig makes too broad of generalizations about the Greek philosophers. Phaedrus's experience at the University of Chicago does not ring true to me. However, the book challenges the reader to think, to ponder life in general and contemplate on how the branches of knowledge tie together.Pirsig's shows parallels between quality and arete (excellence in Greek) and the Buddha. I think there also parallels between Biblical Wisdom and Quality (See Proverbs 8). The book had a tremendous impact when it first came out and influenced a generation of college students. It should be read just so the reader can understand the book's impact on current culture for good or ill. Pirsig is a very good writer."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"At first, I picked up this novel because i was curious as to what it was about. Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance practices the zen it professes. It was reading for one of my classes, but the professor decided to teach another book instead. For this I am highly grateful. It definately wouldn't have had the impact it has had on me if I were required to read it. I wouldn't have paid as much attention to what it had to say. It is a book that must read itself. You can't pick it up and force yourself to read it. It should be savored like a moist piece of tiramisu. I found that at some points I had a hard time reading some of the philosophy, and that was when i needed to put the book down and get a fresh start on it the next day. Pirsig does a fantastic job at building up the plot and the theory until it all finally lets loose on the second to last page (before the afterward). I say that if you begin reading it and don't like it, put it down, give it some time, pick up where you left off, and you might get something out of it."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"This book follows the story of Pheadrus (Pirsig himself) through a disillusionment with the constraints of Wetern Philosophy and Science. In page after page of this &quot;Chotoqua&quot;, Pirsig reveals how our culture is wreck of valueless, empty rationalism with no concern for Quality. He doesn't however, leave it there. He then goes onto explain ways of injecting Quality into one's life throught the metaphor of a motorcycle.To be read at least once a year, ideally around the Winter Solstice."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"This book is among the most problematical for me to assess. On the one hand, it seemed overwhelmingly &quot;honest&quot; to me when I first read it. On the other hand, I've read a great deal of philosophy since then, and the initial book now seems trivial by comparison. The book at least provides stimulus to a reader's thoughts, but then once the reader has grown, he may disavow the original catalyst. The book is too serious for the general reader but too lightweight for a serious student of philosophy. The narrative of the cross-country motorcycle trip is alternately compelling and lackluster. The tone and style of writing is colloquial, which may or may not agree with the reader. Overall, then, I give the book a three-star rating, mainly on account of its quality to stimulate the general reader (and it is the general reader to whom the book is addressed) into thinking about metaphysics and modern society."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance arouses strong feelings in readers, for better or worse. The details and themes of the book have been discussed at length, so I'll simply try to add a little perspective to the ambient buzz. I hope we all dial it down a bit. A work of art can have great value even while having real flaws, and even more unquestionably, the artist's hang-ups can be separated from the artist's talent. Pirsig's views on philosophy, life, meaning, etc do not, by themselves, warrant acerbic responses. On the other hand, even if Pirsig has cracked the code of the universe, we're stilling just dealing with a novel here. The book should be judged on its own merit, not whether the writer is overwrought or melodramatic in his critiques of the current state of the philosophy academy. I happen to have found the book very impactful and intriguing, while simultaneously finding his views on the current state philosophy to be wrong (or at least misguided).The critiques (that Pirsig goes off on rants, his narration is too self-consumed, etc) have a kernel of truth to them. Then again, so do the countless examples of fawning praise (the book is wonderfully multi-layered, Pirsig's writing is penetrating and insightful, etc). I lean toward the latter, but the former have enough going to warrant taking one star away.What I like best about the book is how it strikes at the very core (of insecurities, philosophy, meaning. etc). One could call it an \\"axiomatic exploration,\\" and such a thing is not new to philosophy or literature. Not being new is no crime; I find the idea that this book should be criticized because it hasn't presented anything wholly revolutionary or new to be a bit amusing. I mean, is this the standard we usually apply? So what if countless fans have reoriented their world view around Pirsig's ideas, or if Pirsig is a true believer of every assertion in the book? Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance is a work of art, and should be judged that way. Now, not all critiques have been this unfair or unfocused. If one finds the philosophy presented in the book unimpressive, or the prose inauthentic, or the plot too thin, OK fair enough (I should warn you that I tend to care more for characters and their experiences, than for plots. And I can't judge how good or bad the arc of the book is, because I tend not to need or desire very much of that). But the value of the ideas presented in the book, and the prose therein, are in their ability to provoke empathy, thought, wonder, and perhaps even a little existential angst. If the book does a poor job of that, so be it, but it sparked all these emotional responses in me and in many others.One gets a feel for how heavy life is for the narrator, how hard he takes things, and the challenges present in his dealings with himself and others (but mostly with himself). Affection and blame fly in all directions in the book. Whether either is warranted is not the point. If the book catches you at the right time, it may change your life, at the wrong time, it may annoy the piss out of you. While evoking all sorts of feelings, good and bad, it neither single handedly changed my life or caused me to want to pull my hair out. But it definitely had me hooked as I was reading it, and after I finished, it left quite an impact. That says a lot about a book, in my view."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"My father read the book when he was 25 and said it changed his life. I read the book only last year, at 25 as well. It changed my life too, and my perceptions of it. It's a very brilliant piece of work, with such astute commentaries on society, philosophy, and yes, quality. Unfortunately, the title, Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, is hard for people to get at first. One friend of mine even thought I was reading manual to learn how to fix motorcycles. But I don't know what else I'd call it."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"Although this book requires a bit of reflection (so is therefore not a fast read) it provides a great explanation of ZEN philosophy - the key points summarized are: Western Philosophy = What is right vs wrong, Easter Philosophy = what is best. Also, the author explores at length the concept of \\"quality\\" and the idea that things that are good (that is, of high quality) originate from within, and is not something that can be \\"taught\\". When something is good (music, book, art) the consumer (listener, reader, perceiver) simply knows that it is good (that of high quality). I know this sounds overly simple, but when explored at length these concepts can change the way you perceive everything."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"Just a note before I forget: When you buy this book, put your name in the front of it; it is one of those books in my library that I have to replace from time to time as I loan it... and it's never returned....I have seen in my lifetime a tremendous change in American societal attitudes in mental illness. In the 1960's, anyone running for public office who'd seen a therapist or been treated for depression had to keep that information a deep secret or risk being ostracized. Now in our daily television viewing we often see commericals for the medications that help treat illnesses like chronic depression. In fact, we are moving away from the notion that depression is an \\"illness\\" and moving toward acceptance of such things as chemical imbalances.All of this is to say that, back when it still wasn't cool to be on Zoloft or its equivalent (and I wasn't, I swear I wasn't), I read this book. Not surprisingly (since I was seriously pondering the truth of Hamlet's soliloquy at the time), I don't remember how the book came into my possession. I only remember being changed by it. There is a documented tendency toward depression in exceptionally bright people. Perhaps they think too much. I refer here to Robert Pirsig, author of Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance. Though bookstores often mistakenly shelve this book as a novel, it is, in truth, a memoir. But it is not about the troubled mind as much as it is about thought, clear thought, and all its processes. Though I still cannot fully explain why, this book gave me hope and comfort in a time that was particularly dark. Even now, with bright candles burning everywhere in my life, I consider Pirsig a kindred spirit. Buy this book if you are searching... for truth... or for a life preserver."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"I read this book 30 years ago at the advice of my psycolgist.

It had a good beginning and kept my attention... but at some point it felt like the author was rambling on and I stopped reading. By now I would have to start over and fear I would lose interest in the same place."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"The narrative is basically a vehicle for the author's cracker barrel philosophy. Okay, he has some serious philosophical ideas waiting on the back-burner but they never really make it to the front burner. If you regard Alan Watts, Ayn Rand, and Khalil Gibran as great thinkers, you will find their equal in Pirsig. What I found most interesting about the book is that it reminded me of a person I knew. This person had gone to Saint John's College in Maryland where everyone has to read the Great Books. He claimed to have the highest IQ since Aristotle (it would have been higher but for a childhood illness.) The narrator of Zen reminded me of him - I started to sniff the deja vu around page 35. 'Phaedrus,' as the narrator calls himself, after a character in Plato's eponymous dialogue, is of course Pirsig, a man of towering genius and a veteran of the Great Books Program at Univ. of Chicago (which spawned the program at St John's). Phaedrus saw his fabulous intellect decimated by psychiatric drugs, but he is going to share his wisdom with you one way or another. His wisdom turns out to be an extended meditation on Plato and the notion of Quality, which he relates to such sixties-ish themes as Zen and riding a motorcycle in search of America. Along the way he serves up quotable sound bites like 'the motorcycle you are working on is yourself.' Heavy, man. This book is prized because the 'action' consists in the progress of the author's thoughts, but I found both the journey and the destination unexciting. If you are in search of illumination of the human condition, I suggest as an alternative reading a few of the Great Books, such as Plato himself, Dostoevsky or Shakespeare."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"A friend recommended this more than 35 years ago. I didn't have time and subsequently forgot about it. Should have read it then! Back then, I was informed that the book wasn't about motorcycle maintenance or Zen for that matter. And I knew nothing about the author or the fact that what I was about to read was the Twenty-fifth Anniversary Edition.

Definitely a little more philosophy than I was expecting, and surprisingly little zen.

I had heard horror stories from the previous class about what a drawn-out bore it was, but contrary to their predictions, I found myself swept into the book almost from the first page. Pirsig does an excellent job of balancing the physical with the philosophical, alternating between descriptions of real-world occurrences and mental musings, and while it isn't always easy reading, it's not as convoluted as some might have you believe.This is not a captivating work of fiction or an unaltered history of Pirsig's life; he himself has frequently challenged its classification as fiction or nonfiction (and if you've read the book you'll understand how amusing that really is). What it is is a mindblowing philosophical novel, perfect in particular for those who are interested in Jacques Derrida's idea of deconstruction. And if you appreciate that enough to take your time reading it, it will stick with you: this book resurfaces in every discussion I have about language, ethics, art, or life in general. It's certainly not for everyone, but that doesn't make it a &#34;bad&#34; book.tl;dr: Don't read it if you're looking for a cute story about father-son bonding, but do read it if you want a thought-provoking semi-autobiographical analysis of the way we look at the world."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"I read this book on a recommendation from a friend.

When I saw the Kindle ebook, I bought it on a whim and gave it a second read. Pretty incredible how different my impression was this time around. I understood more about the philosophers that Mr. Pirsig writes about, and the story line came to me more through the father's eyes than the son's. It was very enjoyable to read the sixites' slang terms like &#34;square&#34; and &#34;groovy&#34; and relate back to those crazy years.

Don't be turned off by the title if you are not interested in Eastern religions. It really doesn't directly push any existing religion.

This book taught me how to think. And it taught me I can understand anything if it's written clearly enough and if I'm willing to put some thought into it.Everything in this book interconnects...the characters involved, the setting, the philosophy--decoding the connections (such as wind and heights to phaedrus' appearance) is half the fun.Reading it again after 15 years I find that some of my basic assumptions about the world and life stem from this book. I remember some of Pirsig's babies such as &quot;stuckness&quot; and &quot;gumption&quot; and they are thoughts I've loved to play with over the years. Other ideas--such as the split between eastern and western cultures and various philosophers--have perhaps subtily played with ME through the years. I enjoyed discovering this during my latest re-read.It is so worth the effort to read about Pirsig's views on mechanization, the front windshield being compared to a TV screen, teaching english and so many other things. If you like to think (and why wouldn't you?) you will love this book.That being said,I do feel that Pirsig's logic is flawed. And I enjoyed every step of figuring out why I believe the way I do.

The book has seized rave reviews across the globe, and held best-seller status for record amounts of time. One wonders, what could possibly be in this book that has made it so accredited for such a long time? The answer is that the book takes the reader on a journey that was never supposed to happen. Pirsig elucidates, in four hundred pages, about the conflicts with his son, and himself. Phaedrus, Pirsig's former personality, is represented as a ghost from Pirsig's past. Phaedrus takes the reader through Greek logic, Eastern culture, and Buddhist beliefs. The book gives a good explanation of the differences in Eastern and Western cultures, and how the splitting of the two has caused problems throughout the world.Coming from a background of the dry sciences, my reading of classical literature is hardly amazing. These two topics do not go together and rarely have anything to bridge the gap. This book does that job wonderfully. For the first time, I understood literature of this complexity, because it deals with the sciences and the arts; it kept me interested and also made me relate my life to the characters lives.So, what do I suggest? If you have the time, the patience, and an open mind, this book will do you wonders and will stick with you for years to come."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"A number of the readers who ranked this book poorly seemed to think they had read a novel, though the author says immediately that &quot;it must be regarded in its essence as fact.&quot; The narrator, Pirsig, is a man in early middle age, once a teacher of rhetoric and technical writing at Montana State in Bozeman. While there he became interested in the philosophical pursuit of an objective standard of quality or value (a larger form of the discipline of aethetics); this became an obsession when he entered graduate school at the University of Chicago, and the narrator eventually suffered a severe nevous breakdown. In a mental asylum he received 28 shock treatments over two years, destroying much of his memory. At the time of the motorcycle &quot;chatauqua&quot; that frames this book he has rebuilt his life, working as a a technical writer. He has remarried, fathered two children and come to think of himself as a wholely different person. He calls his earlier self &quot;Phaedrus,&quot; (the wolf) somewhat ironically after a character in a Socratic dialogue.The trip that reunites him with places and people not seen in years allows Pirsig a good deal of time to meditate on Phaedrus, to try to piece together his former life and how he careened toward insanity. Early in the book is an intimation, that his 11-year son, riding pillion on the cycle during the entire trip, is showing early signs of mental illness. This does not make him easier on the boy; he is instead surprsingly strict, bossy, even competitive, which makes him a vivid if often diasagreeable first-person narrator. (Chris Pirsig did suffer a breakdown, and lived only till about 20; he was still alive when ZAMM was published, however.)I go into this at length because many of these reviews seem to ignore the fact that there is a solid overall narrative structure to the book--this, I think, is useful for potential readers to know, together with the fact that it is an unusual and honest memoir of a man who has had a difficult life."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"I'm not suprised to see several one star reviews here on Amazon claiming this book is the most boring piece of literature ever. It's not, and whenever I hear a bad review of this book I think how they would react if they cracked Herodotus' \\"Histories\\".This novel isn't for everyone. Most people that pick it up out of curiosity are likely to put it down. Mr. Pirsig states in the foreward that its not a spiritual guide or very helpful with motorcycle maintenance. In fact, Pirsig was denied several hundred times from various publishing companies when he tried to print his masterpiece. The title is misleading, but that's not what I'd like to talk about.The story tells us of Pirsig, and his son Chris, and of their \\"Chautauqua\\" across the western states. Shortly after the beginning Pirsig introduces his philosophical \\"other\\" self, Phaedrus (named from one of Plato's dialogues'). Phaedrus is more conflicted and anxious than the Pirsig narrating the story. He's almost obsessed with his work; people, and what Quality really means.As the first reviewer visible says, there are thousands of years of Philosophical thought in these few hundred pages. Most of it is Western thought (once again, \\"Zen\\" seems to mislead as a title) concerning what was probably the thoughts of the more liberal nobles in several Greek polises and Roman cities.\\"What is Quality?\\" This question Phaedrus asks himself after having his thought provoked by a lonely secretary in the school where he teaches. That one phrase delves into a thought process that lasts most of the book's remaining pages, drawing parallel's between Pirsig & Chris and their journey across the West.Watching the two story-arc's develop was quite a treat, and there were several pages on the system of Education that had me fascinated and mentally hungry for more. Pirsig seems to have put his entire heart into this novel, and that's one of its small problems: it is a novel. Why teach philosophy as a semi-autobiographical novel? He may have wanted more people to learn of Socrates and other great teachers (which certainly happened by looking at the strong underground fanbase this book has), or may have started the novel without it, and masked some of the books more subtle insecurities with Platonics.It's not clear as to why it's presented the way it is. However, by the ending of the book you'll be astonished at how much you may have learned about yourself (as cliche as this sounds, it does leave you thinking - not many novels do it with this depth). And I strongly urge you to read this book in private and be wary of reviews you read. Many boast about this novel's shocking ending, and I urge you to find out why yourself.Overall, ZAMM is a novel and more. It's the human heart, with all its inconsistencies and heartaches, laid down with hundreds of years of Western thought and psychology in a single novel. The characters feel real (I still think about Phaedrus often, years after reading it), and not one word is wasted in telling the story of these wonderful, flawed human beings. Those that give it bad reviews probably don't have the patience to sit down and enjoy a novel that requires thought and attention.They're probably the same people who think all bikers are the same.

I read it again as a software analyst at age 30 and found that it's about quality, and that it contains relevant, useful, and powerful tools for solving quality problems in the real world.The alienation with technology that Pirsig addresses is a bigger problem than ever. &quot;Dummies&quot; books are best sellers, and &quot;web sites that suck&quot; is a popular web site. The digital revolution is fraught with real-world quality problems, and Pirsig's metaphysics gives insight to their root causes. His metaphysics is of sound philosophical construct, and that's why it still works decades later.The book is not about Zen, art, or motorcycles, so please don't mind the title. The protagonist is a rhetorician. The title is a rhetorical tool. Pirsig defines a &quot;classic-romantic split&quot; that explains why we have so many technology products that are more frustrating than useful. He argues that quality can't be found in objects (products) or subjects (critics), which explains why evaluating quality is difficult.I'm reading it again this summer at age 37, and it's helping me rebuild my world view in response to the changing times, which is the primary useful value of philosophy.

Too much for mere mortals such as us puny humans to endure, so what goes up must come down. Reach journey's end, and it's time to turn round and go home. And so the cycle (no double meaning intended) continues. Pirsigs message is, I think, this; the ultimate metaphysical truth is beyond our understanding - that is why it ('Quality') must be held undefined. Pursue it with our feeble mental capacities, and you will be declared insane (that's what happened to Pirsig, he was institutionalised, and got BIG voltage to the frontal lobes). The best advice he can give us after surviving this experience and, incredibly, still being able to write, is use your own judgement - 'What is good, Phaedrus, and what is not good - Need we ask anyone to tell us these things?' Nobody's ideas, notions, beliefs are absolutely true, they are all relatively true; relative to when we are, where we are, who we are. E=mc2.I'm sorry not everybody loves the book, but I cannot tell them they're wrong. Abandon shallow ego goals and open your mind to the sound of one hand clapping. Art &amp; science aren't opposed opposites, they are both useful tools when you understand what they can do. Robert, thank you for your loving gift of this book. You will always live in my heart."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"I read Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance for the first time a couple of years after it was published, when the eye-catching pink paperback cover was new to bookstores (I remember my parents talking about that bold color while we were on our own long trip of some kind). At that time, I was more or less the same age as the son of the book's narrator, Phaedrus, and of course I could not help but interpret the story from the younger man's perspective: this was an adventure story about a cross country trip, a boy learning about his father, an introduction to a life led by beliefs rather than instinct.Now, as an adult, I see things through Phaedrus' eyes -- which is to say author Robert Persig's eyes, since in terms of concepts (if not geography) it is considered autobiographical -- and I can recognize many of Phaedrus' musings and thoughts as those of a man who is at once confident of and also seeking his place in the world.The book is best known as a tribute or sequel to Henry David Thoreau's Walden, which Phaedrus refers to at several points. Others have pointed out, for example, that the protagonist's long (and not too interesting) discussion of what he carries in his knapsack recall Mr. Thoreau's own endless lists of the materials used to build his lakeside shack or the seeds he planted for his sustenance.But there is much more to this book than that. The provocative blend of Eastern and Western thought, the way he generalizes regarding his philosophical predecessors (and gets some things wrong), the conclusions he draws and the way he sometimes fails to follow his own advice -- they blend to create a picture of an intelligent, complex, and flawed character. Not unlike many of the book's readers.Maybe that is a key to the book's lasting impact -- at least to this point. Like Walden, the book has practically become an icon in the decades since it was published. A quick scan on Amazon reveals dozens of books using the title Zen and the Art of something ... of knitting ... of making a living ... of archery ... of falling in love ... of poker ... of day trading ... even of the actual maintenance of motorcycles.But unlike Walden, I think the high water mark for Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance has come and gone. It was an interesting and compelling re-read for me -- as it would no doubt be for others -- but as I worked through it I started to realize that much of its appeal was as a philosophical time capsule, a glimpse at a time when the globalization of ideas was still new, when East and West were further apart than they are today. Take that away and most of what is left is an adventure story about a cross country trip, a boy learning about his father, an introduction to a life led by beliefs rather than instinct. And that's not so hard to find elsewhere."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"Despite the book's title, Pirsig's journey is primarily one through the history of Western philosophy, from the pre-Socratics through Plato, Aristotle, the 18th century empricists, and 19th century idealists. On this level alone, the book succeeds in being one of the most accessible and reliable treatments of the field. But the text is also a critique of the whole Western &quot;logocentric&quot; tradition, with its emphasis on reason, or &quot;dialectic.&quot; Like Kant (&quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot;) or Kierkegaard (&quot;Concluding Unscientific Postscript&quot;), Pirsig uses reason to expose the limitations of reason. And what does he replace it with? Not Eastern mysticism or Zen riddles but rhetoric. More than the classic rhetoricians that Pirsig exhalts or the 20th-century structuralists and post-structuralists (Barthes, Derrida, Foucault) for which Pirsig's narrative is practically an illustration, &quot;Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance&quot; makes the case for language as the basis for all reality, for all that we think, experience and perceive. It's this conflict between dialectic and rhetoric that drives the narrative, realized in plain yet compelling prose that's capable of staying with the attentive reader for the rest of his or her lifetime. After reading the book twice, I was unable to look at the self, the world, at all things constructed by language in quite the same way. The least successful parts of the book, it seems to me, are the narrator's protracted discussions of the nature of &quot;reality&quot; as a moment inaccessible to human intellect and his somewhat naive, 1960's-style musings on the nature of &quot;quality.&quot; Supposedly his English composition students were immediately able to know it when they saw it, thereby making it unnecessary for him as a teacher to talk about &quot;standards&quot; or to establish criteria. (The suspicion arises that Pirsig hasn't had a great deal of experience teaching students how to write.) Nevertheless, even when a cylinder occasionally misfires, this is a book worth reading carefully and more than once. Unfortunately, because of its &quot;cult&quot; status, many people seem to purchase the text but never finish it. Robert Redford owns the screen rights, but a reader would be ill-advised to wait for the movie version. The &quot;visual&quot; elements of the text--the motorcyle odyssey and troubled father-son relationship--are minor metaphors compared to the ambitious and largely successful intellectual quest."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"Many of my thoughts keep returning to ZAMM. It has been a while since I read it last, and I am going to read it again. I have spent the last couple of hours reading reviews here, and it's evident that there is wide disparity in how readers receive this book. One has to wonder what that says. Is Mr. Pirsig onto something or not? Personally, I am confident that he is, and the way that it is done is so masterful as to be almost magical. At times, I can spot something that doesn't ring quite true, but it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter because the truth that he is trying to tell is still there.Multiple themes are woven together: the ride across some of America's best with his only son and the relationship that's theirs alone, a narrative about insanity through the clouded memory of someone that had/has been labeled as such, an examination of western philosophy and its influence on western thought, an alternative eastern perspective, and more.For many of us that are writing reviews here, Persig begins to unlock a whole realm of possibility. The possibility that awareness of existence (quality, truth, God, whatever you want to call it) may be approachable by non-rational means. Neither logic, anlaysis nor the scientific method may provide the ultimate path. And, without these familar touchstones we are threatened to lose our certainty. Accepting this possibility is both liberating and frightening! It is to stand on the threshold of . . . In a sense, it's a simular place in thought to where the world stood when Columbus discovered the new world.To be willing to follow Persig with Phaedrus and participate in his Chautauquas is an adventure in courage. One must look into the frailities of our own sanity. It is tempting to deny to oneself this vulnerability, and doing so may render this book meaningless and shallow. However, the participative reader finds the captivation of an &quot;Alice in Wonderland.&quot;Not a text, not a novel, not fiction. It is an autobiography! It's hard to believe that it's true, and the book ends before the story ends -- just like life and the reality that endures. Robert Pirsig is a hero to have gone so far in pondering the &quot;deep channels&quot;, and then in sharing his bounty with us.I'm going to read it again. Thank you Robert."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"My 10-year-old son asked me what I wanted for Christmas last year, and I suggested two books I had known about for 20 years or more, but had never actually read: &quot;On the Road&quot; by Jack Kerouac, and &quot;Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance&quot; by Robert Pirsig. He got them both for me, and now, at age 47, I've read them both. Kerouac's book is a breathless, almost endless series of cross-country treks, written in a continuous &quot;present&quot; with little concept of a past or future.&quot;Zen&quot;, in contrast, is a book I wish I had read years ago, knowing full well I would not have understood or appreciated it until now. Pirsig's literary journey is careful and methodical, painstakingly documenting both the physical landscape through which he and his son are riding, and the elaborate philosophical landscape through which humanity has traveled in the last several millennia. It is a history of philosophy which ultimately rejects much of the Aristotelian analysis underlying Western scientific method. I hated philosophy and theology in college, for a variety of reasons, and wish I had this guidebook (and 40+ years of experience) handy as I sat through Metaphysics. Pirsig makes clear the seminal importance of many of the competing ideas of Eastern and Western philosophy, in ways I don't think any of my college professors could have. On a more personal note, Pirsig develops his complex line of thought while traversing the American west with his son Chris on the back of his motorcycle. His discourse with the reader is extensive, highly emotional and intensely personal, while his interaction with his son is almost non-existent. More than once I wanted to yell at Pirsig to stop the bike and talk to Chris instead, only to realize that my own conversations with my own son Chris were, in many ways, similarly perfunctory and self-limiting. In my opinion, no one can read this book without gaining some insight into their own soul, their own values and their place in the world."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"One of my favorite books is \\"Catch-22.\\" When you read Heller's book today, it's lost none of its impact - the message is timeless. On the other end of the spectrum is \\"Stranger in a Strange Land\\" which reads like a hippie farse now, its message seeming entirely dated. \\"Zen\\" falls somewhere in between, but closer to the positive end of the scale.The book tells the story of a middle-aged college professor on a motorcycle trip, trying to re-connect with his son, a task made necessary and more difficult by the fact that our protagonist lost his mind in the recent past obsessing about a concept he refers to as \\"quality.\\"The story follows our hero's attempts to pull the value out of the concept of quality while leaving behind the pieces of it that literally drove him out of his mind. Many of the lessons that come out along the way are as relevant and valuable today as they were the day the book was first published. That said, the book still feels a bit dated in a way that a true classic never should.Recommended if you're curious what the fuss is about."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"The book is based on true accounts experienced by the author. The book doesn't really talk about Zen, but is more based on Western Philosophy. The author writes, \\"What follows is based on actual occurrences. Although much has been changed for rhetorical purposes, it must be regarded in its essence as fact. However, it should in no way be associated with that great body of factual information relating to orthodox Zen Buddhist practice. It's not very factual on motorcycles, either.\\"The book is about the author's cross-country motorcycle trip with his 8 year old son Chris, which leads to a journey of self-discovery. It is an examination of the spiritual relationship between a parent and a child, and man's search for reason. During this journey, the author teaches us about life and the human condition in a profound and thought-provoking way. It is a terrific book about philosophy and life, albeit a difficult read. After reading this book, you might reevaluate the way you live, go on a personal quest for the meaning of life, and be interested in reading more books on philosophy. In my case, the book made me want to read more about Kant and Hume, and review some of the books I read before on Plato and Aristotle.Some of the deep philosophical questions and conundrums raised by the author are:(a) Before Newton discovered The Law of Gravity, was there gravity? Did gravity exist before Newton or is it the thought of Gravity that suddenly manifested the Law of Gravity? Is it the thought of something that suddenly creates it?(b) The Arabs and Indians used the \`zero' before the Romans and Greeks. Why did the Greeks not invent the zero? How did their societies function for so long without the zero? Could it have continued without the discovery of \`zero'? Was the \`zero' always there regardless of whether it was discovered or not?(c) All arguments, solutions, and scientific \`truths' have already been invented. We simply discover the best solution.(d) How do we define the \\"present\\" when everything we're conscious of has already happened, and is already a part of the past?(e) Which self is the real you?(f) What is good and what is bad? The book opens with the following quote:\\"And what is good, Phaedrus,and what is not good--Need we ask anyone to tell us these things?\\"(g) \\"Astronomers would be telling mankind that if he looked long enough through a telescope powerful enough, what he would see is the back of his own head.\\"(h) In life there is no grade, no pass or fail.(i) \\"Any intellectually conceived object is always in the past and therefore unreal. Reality is always the moment of vision before the intellectualization takes place. There is no other reality.\\"(j) \\"Religion wasn't invented by man. Man was invented by religion.\\" [No idea who invented women, hihihihihi](k) How can something can be exclusively \\"material,\\" when our reality is exclusively spiritual(l) We should remain open to the part of the world that is beyond appearances, beyond the so-called matter, and cannot be experienced but only imagined.(m) How do you deal with technology and remain sane?(n) Man searches for something that he can't quite define, identify or reach.Plato and Aristotle, the author argues, conceived a system of thought in which beauty is severed from functionality. Functionality became less attractive to us than beauty. Plato and Aristotle, according to the author, committed a murderous act by this system of thought that is still carried out till today. \\"Quality\\" has thus been victimized.The author went insane as a graduate student as he searched for the answer to \\"what is quality?\\", and spent considerable time at the asylum. He was subjected to shock treatments that wiped out his personality and most of his memory. He later realized that he was not really insane, but thought in a different level than most people.Pirsig sees the problems in our world as the result of an overemphasis on beauty, when functionality is more essential. One reviewer puts it nicely, \\"...pure \`function' has problems of its own. For example, our bodily organs carry out the function of allowing us to live, but one doesn't really desire for our skin to be translucent so we can watch these functions. In fact, we would have a revulsion to such a thing. Therefore, we have a combination of both \\"form\\" [beauty] and \\"function\\"; our organs work very well without our having to see them. This is the desirable state. This desirable state is called \`Quality'.\\"However, \`Quality' is indefinable. It comes before thought, and before actions. Any attempt at describing it is useless, because as soon as you attempt to, you are only talking about one aspect of it.This is one of those books that you either both understand and enjoy or you don't. It is really all about timing, your past experiences and knowledge, and your reasons for reading this book in the first place. If you don't understand it put it down and wait until the time is right. Don't throw it away!Read this book slowly if you really want to understand it. If you like to read thought provoking and intellectually challenging books, you will love it!To close, one reviewer wrote, \\"Many of the negative reviews are from people who had a preconceived notion of what this book was before they read it (either from the title or from a recommendation) and were upset that it didn't meet their expectations. It seems to me that these folks have received their Zen lesson...\\""},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"Not sure if this is the worst novel or worst philosophy book I've ever read. And I've read quite a few novels and philosophy books but this book sticks out. It is a travel novel inspired by actual events in the author's life and a philosophical treatise but fails as both. The book is based on a motorcycle trip Pirsig had with his adolescent son. It details the entire trip with the story broken by long intervals of Pirsig's \\"philosophizing,\\" complaining, and trivial observations.First, why it fails as a philosophical treatise: The author once dropped out as a failed philosophy grad student and I can see why he did so poorly in the subject. The book is very unclear and without well reasoned claims. There are several things that good philosophy consists of: 1. It makes true claims that are not trivially true. 2. It makes these claims in as clear and concise a manner as possible. 3. It uses good reasons and evidence to support these claims.Pirsig's philosophizing is centered around his notion of \\"quality\\" but he does not succeed in making this notion clear and relevant. Right from the start, there is a problem because Pirsig does not give any clear, coherent definition of what he even means by quality. We are given hints, metaphores, analogies and stories and suggestions on what he means and even a somewhat clumsily worded \\"definition\\" at one point but all these remain vague and unsupported. Of course, Pirsig will say (and does so many times in the book) that no definition can be given because by its very nature quality is ineffable and undefinable. But the problem with that is that he DOES give a definition (like I said, a vague and probably incoherent one but one nevertheless). This seems to be a strategy of dodging crucial substantive points to avoid potentially damning counter arguments and examples. That's what it seemed like to me. We are told that his notion of quality has something to do with the common understanding of that term (such as quality in essay writing or motorcycle maintenance, e.g.). We are also told that quality is neither objective nor subjective but is something that comes prior to that \\"duality.\\" We are told that quality is something that is like the Tao in Taoist philosophy, like appreciation for jazz and being \\"cool\\". We are told that quality is the perception of something before it is conceptualized. But all these are distinct concepts and each needs to be spelled out and tied together because they all seem to be saying something very different. Many of these seem to be wholly different concepts with each other but no tying of them together is made (or seemingly even attempted), just a blind acceptence that they all mean the same thing as this \\"quality\\" of his which we should all then blindly accept as the ultimate truth and meaning of life. It seems that Pirsig has many fuzzy ideas and no clear overall cohesive picture but feels the need to impart all his little brain farts on us while suggesting (but never showing!) the relevance to each other and to life and reality. Many of his musings are replete with equivocation and false dilemma fallacies which he seems completely oblivious to.As a novel, this book also fails for the following reasons. In my view, a good novel should avoid overt proselytizing of the author's views while at the same time have a moral core deeply embedded in the narrative structure. It should also avoid self promotion and pretentiousness. Granted it takes a skilled writer to show naturally, skillfully, subtly and palpably his or her convictions instead of dictating them on the proverbial pulpit to the readers. Pirsig displays no shame in doing the later. He just goes off on rambles and random b!tching about the cruel injustices he has faced in life such as his petty problems and quibbles with his academic advisors, teachers and fellow grad students while in graduate school. These petty problems and quibbles are made into great struggles of wills and epic battles of Good (Pirsig) vs Evil (his advisors, fellow students, etc). These characters he is doing battle against are cliche and simplistic caricatures. Pirsig wants readers to see him as a misunderstood genius who must struggle against his own inner demons with madness and his stupid and vulgar teachers and fellow students who just don't seem to understand him. One not only sees why he has failed as a philosophy student but as a person worth helping and knowing. The parts of the book about the trip and motorcycle maintenance are mind-numbingly boring. Pirsig tries hard to make them relate to his idea(s) on quality but his straining to do so shows itself without success.The book passes itself off as an all encompassing, original, life-changing philosophy and this is how many people who have read it seem to see it. But beneath this self-proclaimed Philosopher King's garb is the bloated excesses of New Age nonsense."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"Came next day, even tho I ordered 2 day delivery.

You should take the machine to a real mechanic who > knows how to figure these things out.\\" - Ch. 24, pg. 271 [out of 402]Pirsig builds of this common feeling of stuckness--lost keys, test questions that we can't quite remember, computers that don't do what we are telling it, etc. The book opens on a road trip that the author is making with his son Chris, and John and Sylvia, a likable couple who are friends of Pirsig. Chris is riding on the back of his father's motorcycle, John and Sylvia on their BMW. Pirsig knows his bike inside and out, observant of every mechanical nuance that might be a clue toward keeping the motor in top condition. John and Sylvia, however, both are \\"stuck\\" when it comes to technology (BMW cylces are known for having few mechanical problems on the road), and leave even the smallest jobs to a paid mechanic. Finally Pirsig comprehends why: \\"To get away from technology out into the country in the fresh air and sunshine is why they are on the motorcycle in the first place. For me to bring it back to them just at the point and place where they think they have finally escaped it just frosts both of them, tremendously.\\" (Ch. 1, pg. 8)Pirsig's book presents a theory about the source of John's and Sylvia's exasperation with technology and outlines the foundations for a solution. At this point I feel it necessary to issue a disclaimer. You may be thinking this book sounds like both an enjoyable and illuminating read. And for the first 100 pages you'd be right! The core of the book shifts in style, though it's not necessarily a change for the worse. My disclaimer: \\"This book was written for people who like to struggle with ideas.\\" Pirsig, who also spent four years teaching rhetoric in the Montana and Illinois university systems, admits as much at this point within the book--\\"I suppose if I were a novelist rather than a Chautauqua orator I'd try to 'develop the characters' of John and Sylvia and Chris... That would be quite a novel, but for some reason I don't feel quite up to it.\\" (Ch. 12, pg. 129)Webster's defines a Chautauqua as: \\"a traveling show or local assembly that flourished in the United States in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, that provided popular education combined with entertainment in the form of lectures, [among other activities].\\" This book was written precisely for those individuals who feel excited by the idea of a Chautauqua.The rest of the book is more an autobiography of the author's journey through Western thought than a novel, although it retains many literary elements. Pirsig's insights continued to surprise me through the whole 373 pages. His main concern is the question \\"What values does scientific thinking teach us?\\" He comes to doubt society's commonly-accepted viewpoint that science teaches only morally-neutral, objective analysis.Pirsig is not satisfied with this answer because for him, science is a means to Truth rather than a means to utilitarian application. Utilitarian application may satisfy most, but Pirsig invested too much in the pursuit of deeper Truth to stop there. To him, the near universal acceptance of utilitarian application as a validation of science, at the expense of the pursuit of a single absolute truth, becomes a ghost that haunts his whole way of thinking. \\"Great minds struggle to cure diseases so that people may live longer, but only madmen ask why. One lives longer in order that he may live longer. There is no other purpose. That is what the ghost says.\\" (Ch. 7, pg. 85)The problem, as he sees it, is that there are infinite possible applications of science, and indeed an infinite number of truths that experimentation can prove. We treat scientific knowledge as an end worthy in itself, but there is no ultimate completeness to be found there. \\"It is science itself that is leading mankind from single absolute truths to multiple, indeterminate, relative ones... Science itself is producing the indeterminacy of thought and values that rational knowledge is supposed to eliminate.\\" (Ch. 10, pg. 108)In this way, science and technology become every bit as subjective as musical taste or religious belief. We use science to extend lifespans and rearrange the elements of the earth into any number of products for physical comfort or electronically-produced amusement in the same way that one prefers Beethoven over Mozart, or Catholicism over Baptists.To avoid facing this inconsistency, Western thought has petrified, insisting that Classicism and Romanticism are mutually exclusive spheres rather than two approaches toward the same end. There's the \\"hard\\" sectors of science and business, which are ruled by objectivity, and then everything else--the arts, volunteer work, religion. In fact these spheres are different, but it is wrong to think think they have nothing to do with each other, and that the \\"hard\\" sphere should be controlled only by objective analysis. Classicism develops out of our social predisposition to use language--to learn the accepted name everything and conform to one's cultural grouping. Romanticism comes from humanity's evolutionary, biological need to experiment and experience until arriving at the behavior that feels most right. It is the interaction of these competing worlds that created and has the ability to expand humanity's consciousness. Pirsig explores this fundamental duality of consciousness through the lens of Western philosophical thought, using motorcycle maintenance to explain the Classical mode of dividing and classifying knowledge, and Zen, the Romantic holistic approach.This book is for those who enjoy wrestling with these sort of ideas. In one of the more revealing autobiographical segments, Pirsig employs a quote from Albert Einstein describing an angel who expels the egoists and utilitarians from the Temple of Science. All that remain, \\"those who have found favor with the angel,\\" are those whose \\"finely tempered nature longs to escape from his noisy cramped surroundings into the silence of the mountains where the eye ranges freely through the still pure air and fondly traces out the restful contours apparently built for eternity.\\" (Ch. 10, pg. 104) For these, I could not recommend ZAMM highly enough."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"I think this book should be considered as a course prior to do any kind of research. In this book, Pirsig successfully transcends science and logic to seek truth. Knowledge is seen as a state of mind, which needs not to be stored in places such as universities. Very touching style of writing of the book makes the reader flow with Pirsig's journey."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"Anybody who knows me well enough would say that this is exactly the type of book I would enjoy reading, being a blend of deep philosophy, the freedom of the open road and a spirit of adventure. And indeed, going even further, I was able to identify with both the narrator and with Phaedrus in several parts of the book, and saw various parts of my own personality and events in my life reflected in their characters and circumstances. Phaedrus, alone in his own universe, causing him to be someone who others do not always understand and who are sometimes frightened by him, when in fact he means no harm. Phaedrus who doesn't give a damn about what others think of him or being right in society's eyes as long as he knows he is right. Phaedrus, looking for meaning and purpose in life and being considered the insane one when in fact the ones doing the criticising are the ones in need of help. The narrator, going on a long drive across America as a form of therapy for the soul and a means of reflection about life and trying to determine what course his future should take and to excise some ghosts from the past.One of the great strengths of this book is the ability of the author to present and link difficult concepts in a way that you can easily understand and which make sense. The book is heavy going in some places, but I can only imagine how much heavier going it would have been had a less skilled author tried to write it. To try and unite the concepts of ancient Greek philosophy, modern science, Eastern mysticism, and religion all into one coherent whole takes some doing, but Pirsig succeeds in this. Along the way philosophical concepts such as scientific materialism, idealism, sophism, logic, rhetoric etc. are also clearly discussed by the author, all within the underlying story of the book, together with arguments for or against these.This book did not disappoint. In fact, the conclusions reached are quite astounding and certainly make sense. Yet I do feel that at times the way the author presents the practical application of Quality in one's life is a bit idealistic and too easy sounding. Just get interested in and value whatever you have to do and all will be fine! Even if it's fixing a motorcycle or balancing the books or picking up golf balls on a driving range ,or washing dishes. Mmm, don't think things are always quite as simple as that. But at least this is philosophy that can be applied to one's everyday life, and Pirsig makes a concerted effort to show readers how they can do so, especially so that they can live more fulfilled and meaningfully. Too often, philosophers and enlightened people are accused of being impractical dreamers whose beliefs do not address the realities of a harsh world. Not necessarily so with the ideas and concepts in this book.So then, what is the underlying message of this book? Firstly, this is not a book about Zen Buddhist practice and nor is it a book about motorcycle maintenance. Rather, practical motorcycle maintenance is skillfully used by the author to illustrate various philosophical concepts he is thinking about during his trip (the title of this book, although strange sounding at first, was cleverly chosen by the author. I think that one of the reasons for the success of the book is its strange title. Had it been called, for example, \\"New Concepts in Modern Philosophy\\" etc. it is unlikely this book would have been the success it has been with the mass market, but that still wouldn't deter from its brilliance). Pirsig is saying that our way of dividing the world into subjects (mind/ consciousness) and objects is incorrect. There is a third entity which is independent of the two and which encompasses them: Quality, which is found in the relationship of the two with each other. It is the point at which the subject and object meet. Quality is not a thing, it is an event. It is the event at which the subject becomes aware of the object. And because without objects there can be no subject - because the objects create the subject's awareness of himself - Quality is the event at which awareness of both subjects and objects is made possible. However, it is not just the result of a collision between subject and object. The very existence of subjects and objects themselves is deduced from the Quality event. The Quality event is the cause of subjects and objects, which are then mistakenly presumed to be the cause of the Quality! While in the process of coming to the above conclusions, the author addresses such questions as: Can Quality be defined? If not, what does that imply? If it happens that Quality exists in the object, why can't scientific instruments detect it? On the other hand, if Quality is subjective, exiting only in the mind of the observer, then isn't it just a fancy name for whatever you like? Isn't an object just an intellectual construct deduced from its qualities? Pirsig continues: \\"People differ about Quality, not because Quality is different, but because people are different in term of past experience/ a priori analogues. The easiest intellectual analogue of pure Quality that most people understand is that Quality is the response of an organism to its environment. In our highly complex organic state we advanced organisms respond to our environment with an invention of many marvelous analogues. We invent earth and heavens, trees, stones and oceans, gods, music, arts, language, philosophy, engineering, science. We call these analogues reality. And they are reality! We mesmerize our children in the name of truth into knowing that they are reality. We throw anyone who does not accept these analogues into an insane asylum. But that which causes us to invent the analogues is Quality. Quality is the continuing stimulus which our environment puts upon us to create the world in which we live. All of it. Now, to take that which has caused us to create the world, and include it within the world we have created is clearly impossible. That is why Quality cannot be defined. If we do define it we are defining something less than Quality itself. Quality is the great generating force of all religions, past and present, all knowledge, everything.\\" The author then goes on to explain the striking similarities between Quality and Zen/ God/ Tao/ Buddha/ Ultimate Truth etc. How he arrives at these conclusions is explained thoroughly in the book. Read the book!While reading the story one undoubtedly gets the feeling that the author is of course speaking about events and things that really did happen in his own life. Therefore, he really did think all the things in the book and maybe \\"crack a great secret\\". Because of the depth, brilliance and originality of the way the concepts are united, you feel a little bit of arrogance between the lines coming from the author, and sometimes it seems that he skillfully diverted such possible perceptions of the reader by letting it seem as though the characters in the book discovered everything, and not the author. The book is certainly not written in an arrogant style, and the author must have a deep and brilliant mind to have synthesized all these concepts so skillfully. Also, the part near the beginning of the book where he discusses scientific laws, like gravity for example, not being real things either but only \\"ghosts\\" in people's minds ie. subjective entities, was very interesting, and a nice stab at scientific materialism which is too often criticizes other fields for their lack of \\"objectivity\\".One of the things I found quite surprising, but in a negative way, was that at the end of the book, in the Afterword, the author speaks about one of the characters who had passed away in real life a few years after the book had been written. The author speaks about how one is always sad when this type of thing happens and a person always wonders if one lives on after death in some form of energy etc. He mentions that he eventually came to the opinion that one does, for example his newborn daughter who seems to be the incarnation of the former person who passed away. What surprised me about this piece from the author was that you would have thought he would have had his beliefs and opinions on this sorted out long ago. I found it surprising that in a book full of such deep and penetrating insights, that he would not be sure about something as fundamental as death and what that means. I almost felt as though the author let something slip here in the very end, in the Afterword of all places. Nevertheless, this book thoroughly deserves five stars, and I know I will return to it often in order to revise the concepts and ideas presented therein to feed my soul with Quality.(By the way, there is a very interesting website called Quantonics.com which I stumbled across a couple of years ago, and which is where I first found out about this book. They go into all these concepts in a very scientific way, using quantum physics etc. Interesting stuff.)"},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"This book single-handedly rekindled my interest in reading. Through college, I had essentially stopped reading anything except my texts for class, but decided to borrow this from a friend on his recommendation as I traveled through Europe after graduation.I can't even call it a page-turner, because there were so many times when I just had to close the book and sit there and THINK about the passage I had just read. Sometimes for 15 minutes or more. I went to bed each night of that trip thinking about what I'd read from Zen/Motorcycle earlier that day. The first book I recommend to my traveling friends.

I highly recommend it to anyone with an open mind ready to look at things in different light.It perfectly brings the modern way of thought about science and art into perspective. It transmits the simplicity of beauty and the role quality plays in every decision we make.Definetly a must."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"There are only a handful of books that have really changed the way I've looked at things; Jerzy Kosinski's The Painted Bird, Victor Frankl's Man's Search for Meaning, Julian Jayne's The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bi-Cameral Mind, Ludwig von Mises' Human Action and Robert M. Pirsig's Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance (ZAMM). Pirsig's book may be the most profound because it not only challenges, but re-labels our entire thought process, challenging many of our most deeply held values. In fact, it's subtitled, (An Inquiry Into Values).Proof that I'm not alone in assessing the impact of ZAMM is the fact that it has remained in print for nearly three decades since it was first published in 1974. That's quite an achievement for a book with such a clunky title - a book whose first publisher warned Pirsig not to expect \\"much more\\" than the $5,000 advance because, \\"works of this kind rarely sell in volume\\" and whose author readily states up front that it \\"has little to do with the study of Zen and isn't all that accurate when it comes to motorcycle maintenance either.\\"On the surface, ZAMM is a very simple story about the narrator's cross-country trip on motorcycle with his emotionally troubled son, Chris and their technologically challenged neighbors, John and Sylvia Sutherland. Pirsig wraps a brilliant philosophical analysis of values, in a road story that pits Phaedrus (the narrator's former self) against his current, post-electroshock persona, his son and the techno-phobic Sutherland's.The story unfolds as a series of talks or Chautauquas, in which the narrator explores such topics as \\"Classical (emphasis on underlying function) Vs Romantic (emphasis on external form)\\" styles of thinking, \\"defining quality\\" and \\"insanity as a rejection of the accepted mythos\\" (an idea previously explored by Thomas Szass).Ultimately, Pirsig does nothing less than re-focus the nature and definition of QUALITY. What is it? How do we define the \\"present\\" when everything we're conscious of has already happened, been processed and is already a part of the past?Phaedrus looks at quality and notes, \\"we all know it when we see it, but how is it truly defined? What makes one thing of greater or less \\"quality\\" then another?\\" He comes close to quantifying it in his \\"Church of Reason Lecture,\\" which starts on page 142 of the original paperback release.Pirsig breaks the world down into two outlooks, Classic (which focuses on the underlying function) and Romantic (which focuses on the outer-lying form). Aesthetics (the study of beauty) is form based or Romantic thinking, while mechanics (the study of how things work) is function based or Classical thinking. He uses this to explain why different people see the same world in very different ways. In this journey he shows the difference between the two as the difference between the narrator's Classical outlook and that of the Sutherland's Romantic one.John and Sylvia both enjoy the look and feel of riding a motorcycle, but despise the mechanical chores of keeping it functioning at top proficiency. John is proud of his shiny, new and very expensive BMW motorcycle, but can't get into the daily maintenance of it. Phaedrus, on the other hand, is primarily attracted to and focused on the underlying form of the motorcycle. He is fascinated with how it works and what causes it to break down. Phaedrus is interested in the mechanics of the bike because he wants to minimize its weaknesses and maximize its effectiveness. The Sutherland's just want to ride, and to avoid at all costs the mechanics of the thing because that's what they're on vacation for - to get away from the mechanistic world.This Classic/Romantic split is important today because it explains all of our contemporary socio-political schisms so well. Emotional thinking is always Romantic, while pragmatic or logical thinking is always Classical. Both sides see only one true way of looking at things and both overlook an important part of the puzzle of life.It's why so many Leftists wear the \\"bleeding heart liberal\\" tag as a badge of honor. It feeds their emotionalism. Anything that sounds compassionate, feels good or \\"helps people,\\" is, to their form based thinking, \\"good,\\" and people who espouse self-reliance and individual responsibility are, in their view, \\"mean-spirited, Social Darwinists and well...evil\\" On the other hand, that's why economic Libertarians and social conservatives see \\"do-gooder liberals\\" as \\"grossly misguided dupes who care nothing for helping people help themselves and as well...evil.\\"It's why, Romantic thinkers rarely use facts. They support their positions on what \\"feels right,\\" or \\"fair.\\" It's also why, when emotional Leftists are confronted with facts they don't like, they interpret the data as \\"angry\\" or \\"argumentative.\\" This also explains why Classical thinking Libertarians and Romantic thinking Leftists don't communicate. Classicists deal in pragmatics and facts, while Romantics deal in feelings and appearances.What Pirsig does, is synthesize both Classical and Romantic components into a sort of \\"unified field theory\\" of living. He offers a vision of a complete whole - a fusion of logic and emotion, form and function. An ideal whole that we're still very far from. An ideal that cost his narrator, Phaedrus, dearly.Upon reaching Montana, the Sutherland's split and head south, while the narrator and his son head on toward Bozeman, the College town in which the narrator's former self (Phaedrus) taught. As they get closer to Bozeman, the pull of the narrator's former self (Phaedrus) grows stronger and he begins reliving some of the philosophical questions that had brought Phaedrus to the brink of emotional breakdown.The entire book becomes a journey of self-discovery in which the reader comes along for a ride. As the narrator gets in touch with the questions and pursuits of his former life, he realizes that, in order to connect with his son, Chris, he must first confront his former self (Phaedrus). Read it for yourself, it's truly a modern day masterpiece."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"I am an engineer that has been doing some soul searching for about a year now.

A must read for anyone who just can't put their finger on IT, whatever IT is. The perspective the author presents is not necessarily the correct one, but it helped me learn more about my perspective on life and living."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"This book is about what the title says - an inquiry into values. But, that is an understatement. The author, through the main character, questions and challenges you to validate how you do and accomplish things. I have tried not to give away the contents in this review for it is best left to be read.The main character is on a yearly vacation and chooses to take a ride down south from his place in Montana. His son accompanies him. As they ride, Phdrus, recollects his past and the path that led him to his current self. He goes over how he viewed doing or accomplishing tasks and how those around him differed. In the process he depends a great deal on his experience with both eastern and western religion and philosophies. His knowledge of the Hindu scriptures, religion and simple but profound truths is particulary gratifying to me (Twat Tham Asi - I urge you to explore this).A major part of the book, he spends laying a foundation in defining what he thinks is Quality. By referring to Quality, he in a way, is referring to the Absolute in what one days. A few examples he delineates that come in one's way of looking at or achieving quality - Stuckedness, classic and romantic way of approaching solving a problem, value rigidity.Through his journey, both on the motorcycle and his life (past and present), he walks you into constantly thinking and re-evaluating how you can approach your way of doing.At times, I felt a great deal of self-righteousness in his approach. After all, not everyone is as gifted as a few people on this earth. His choosing his young son as somebody to display his disapproval constantly is particularly bothering and worrisome if you are a loving parent. Ultimately is it a big relief that he realizes the hypocracy and the truth why he needs to get back to his looked-upon self. Life is more about loving and caring than about how you view things, however right you are.The afterward is something you wouldn't expect. I had read this book twenty or so years ago as a young man and all I could remember today was that it was one the very best books I had ever read.

To be honest, I thought this book was going the director of \\"On The Road\\"- the protagonists of both books travelling the country and learning a lesson at the terminus. But this novel has a deeper purpose, which Pirsig explains through his digressions throughout the book which divulge the details of his dissent into mental illness. I was mesmorised by the amount of detail Pirsig puts into the novel- from the descriptions and subsequent explanations of his dreams to the relative triviality of his cross-country trip. A note of warning- this book is not for the faint-hearted. If philosophy is not your thing, then steer clear of this novel. Even though philosophy is one of my favourite subjects, I found the book a bit tedious at times.

Excellent."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"Robert Pirsig has written a book that is standing the test of time. It is both a dramatic and philosophical triumph.Pirsig begins his journey with an observation: his traveling companions, John and Sylvia, are strangely alienated from the technological world from which they derive so much benefit. John will not even consider maintaining his own motorcycle. Many Americans are just like them. Why?Pirsig traces the answer to the Greeks, specifically Plato and Aristotle who, he argues, conceived a system of thought in which beauty is severed from functionality (as if the engine of the motorcycle is somehow disconnected from the shiny chrome machine we see on the highway.) Functionality or \\"classic\\" thought became less attractive to us than \\"romantic\\" thought or beauty. Plato and Aristotle, Pirsig argues, committed a murder that their adherents have covered up ever since. The victim was quality.That is the philosophical issue in a nutshell. The story's high drama revolves around Pirsig's rediscovery of \\"Phaedrus,\\" the person he had been before his manic exploration of quality literally drove him mad. One of the book's powerful ironies is that the deeper the protagonist digs into his forgotten past, the stronger his identification with the persona of Phaedrus and the more he isolates himself from Chris, who is frightened by his father's deep silences and the \\"return\\" of Phaedrus' ghost. In short, his very attempt to tear down the divide between quality and our lives diminished the quality of his relationship with his son, at least for a time.The larger issue remains: to the extent that an appreciation for quality does not inform our lives, we are less understanding, less excellent, less civilized and more alienated from ourselves and our neighbors. Viewed this way, the absence of quality is the absence of God.When Pirsig applies this critique to modern-day culture, he strikes familiar yet disturbing chords. Pirsig describes &quot;primary&quot; culture as the mass-produced television shows, pop music, consumer goods and products that in superficial ways bind us together. The more we embrace this &quot;primary&quot; culture, the less we are involved in the real communities around us and the lonelier we become. Pirsig contrasted the loneliness he experienced in urban, crowded environments with the peace he felt when riding his motorcycle through the open fields of the Midwest.&quot;The explanation, I suppose, is that the physical distance between people has nothing to do with loneliness. It's psychic distance, and in Montana and Idaho the physical distances are big but the psychic distances between people are small.&quot;He continues: &quot;I think if we are going to reform the world, and make it a better place to live in, the way to do it is not with talk about relationships of a political nature, which are inevitably dualistic, full of subjects and objects and their relationship to one another; or with programs full of things for other people to do.... The place to improve the world is first in one's own heart and head and hands, and then work outward from there. Other people can talk about how to expand the destiny of mankind. I just want to talk about how to fix a motorcycle. I think what I have to say has more lasting value.&quot;Today, we take discussion of quality for granted: Total Quality Management, the Pursuit of Excellence, Synchronicity -- an entire genre of business and spiritual literature revolves around the concept. Tom Peters, Steven Covey, Peter Senge and Max DePree are among the management gurus who circle the globe to engage in &quot;quality&quot; talk. If we have not fully digested Pirsig's critique, we have at least acknowledged the premise of his argument -- a culture that quits caring will not long endure, economically or spiritually."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"Comments on Robert Persig's, &quot;Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance&quot;. This sojourn has three levels. First, it is the story of a father and son taking a vacation, via motorcycle, on a cross country adventure. Second, it is an examination of the spriritual relationship between a parent and a child. Lastly, it is the portal to man's insanity, an examination of man's search for reason. In the first level, this is a story of a father and son, on a motorcycle, riding cross country with friends. There is no identified destination, just the daily routine of existance, driving, eating, sleeping and driving again. In the second level, the reader can examine the spiritual relaionship between the father and son. They seem to be searching for the door that will connect them to each other. Instead they are both helpless because they can see each other but are not able to connect with each other. This is demonstrated through dreams that both seem to have. Persig may be commenting on the state of being of mankind, in that it searches for something that it can't quite define, identify or reach. The last level is the portal to man's insanity. Persig creates image that the father, once labeled insane by humanity because of his search for the definition of Quality, realizes that he was not really insane, but thought at a differnet level or dimension than most people. The father addresses the issues created by nature and technology when the two roads meet. However, Persig demonstrates that many people do not, they just blindly except the conflict and fail to pursue the true meaning of it. Through Persig's examination of quality, technology, stuckness and rationality he analizes the dichotomy between the Classical and Romantic thought that is the foundation of Logic. Persig's physical journey ends before they reach their goal because he realizes they do not need to go that far. Persig suggests that he was the only obstacle towards his search for the truth. While the book neither teaches Zen or Motorcycle repair, it is Eastern in thought rather than Western in nature. This is demonstrated by the inward reflection the main character engaged in and the suggestion of a cyclical birth and death process at the very end of the book. This book is alot more than what it appears. It is entertaining, thought provoking and suggestive. While reading the book will satisfy the urge to be delightfully entertained, it will also cause the reader to think about the truths that so often are lost in the daily routine."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"I first read this book in the early '70's, when I was reading many of the pop philosophy classics of that time and culture.

I felt that it stood head &amp; shoulders above most of the sophomoric propaganda being touted at the time. I was extremely surprised to read some of the negative reviews printed here.

This is not a novel, and it in not intended for those who wish to be 'entertained' by the reading. This is about a search for truth, and only those who truly desire truth themselves will profit by it. True, it's not about Zen (at least on the surface) or motorcycles (except in passing), but the chosen title does as good a job as any.

More important is the manner in which both stories meet and mingle to give birth to and nurture Pirsig's discussion of his concept of Quality, specifically rhetorical Quality.

The further he thought about and researched this question the further he felt that modern life, and modern thinking, was derailed from its true path thousands of years ago as Aristotlean thought won out over competing schools (Aristotle apparently loved putting things into categories and tree like structures. &quot;Good&quot; was beneath &quot;Truth&quot; but above &quot;Rhetoric&quot;, that sort of stuff). When philosophy was first &quot;created&quot; it was decided that things were to be broken down into subjects and objects: things, and the observations of things. The hero's revelation was that Quality was neither subjective (that is, it resided inside the object regardless of what our opinion of it was) nor objective (it was whatever &quot;we liked&quot;), rather it was something that -gave rise- to things and the observations of things: in other words, Quality wasn't subjective or objective, it preceeded both and -created- them. So our current way of thinking - that things break down into subjects and objects, (romantic and classic), and start from there, is fatally flawed he felt.After the hero went insane years back he was subjected to shock treatments that wiped out his personality and most of his memory. As he travels across country in the present with his son (who he also worries has mental problems) his reflections on motorcycle maintenance and the benefits that categorizing the parts and the careful maintenance procedures give rise to old memories - he disliked Aristotle who believed in that sort of thing, yet here he has come around to that view from a different angle - that ultimately starts him down the same road to mental illness he went down before. But as he travels down this road to mental illness again he rediscovers his old self so he doesn't want to veer off it. Which self is the real him?While the book was very enoyable on different levels, I did have some problems with its underlying premise. Why Quality? When you go into such infinite detail as he does concerning philosophy you can just as easily ask &quot;What is Harmony?&quot; or &quot;What is Purity?&quot; or &quot;What is Resonance?&quot; and make the same academic conclusions. Also, his original idea to leave Quality undefined is just like saying &quot;I can't define pornography but I know it when I see it&quot;. What's up with that? It's like doing a mathematical proof where you start with &quot;OK, division by zero is now OK, let's see where that leads me&quot;. So the idea of going insane looking into Quality strikes me a little funny. OK, OK, it wasn't Quality itself that did it to him rather it was his feeling that current thought was all wrong, so alright.So overall I fully recommend this book if you're looking for something intelligent and engaging - food for real thought."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"As an avid 16 year old reader (yes there are some), I must say that I love this book. I tried to write a big review but nothing I can write now would do this book justice. This book is just amazing, it's changed how I look at things, how I appreciate them. I hope that one day I can take a class in college on this book. I know that I can't fully comprehend and appreciate everything in this book, but it still leaves me with a sense of awe. It's a profound kind of feeling on the scale of when I first say the grand canyon, or the vietnam memorial, or the first sunset I saw out west; this book is awesome.

O.K. so it's not that easy, but people who can't digest other philosophical literature might find insight here. Pirsig makes a good cas for the reasons for the division between classical and romantic, and his ideas on quality are worth reading. He even tells a good story. But the beauty of it is that it may make you feel excited about thinking. Isn't the phrase &quot;the high country of the mind&quot; and inspiring one. It made me excited about thinking and understanding the world all over again, although it didn't bring me that close to achieving it.

This book is a heart-wrenching (yet triumphant) story of one man's search for truth and value. It also poses several questions that will push a reader to reconsider his/her understanding of truth and reality. Pirsig's book is a pleasant and very worthwhile read, even if you just read it for his personal story. However, it is his plunge into metaphysics that makes his monumental work so great.

I don't know whether a philosophy major would find it interesting but to a layman it was fascinating. The motorcycle trip and philosophical journey start on the east coast and move through the midwest and great plains before making the heady trip into the Rockies. As the land is relatively flat so is the story and this is where people get bogged down wondering what the point is. But the rockies is where it all happens. If you make it that far you'll find an exhillerating philosophical discussion (again, for the layman anyway). At the very peak of the mountain the land and the philosophical underpinnings start to give way in small rock slides. Where it is too dangerous to climb higher, because the land is slippery and the philosophical concepts are more than he feels he can get into in a book for laymen, I wish he had taken the risk and climbed higher. I felt capable of understanding the concepts he was shying away from.

Be ready for the highs and lows of travel, and watch out for a very lengthy discussion on some rather lofty matters; it's tough to get through, but once you do, you'll be glad you made the effort.Read this book twice: you will learn from it."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"I have marked several pages in this book where the author succinctly wrote about ideas that I have had but were unclearly conceived in my own mind. A problem many of us have is with language itself being of such abstract nature, often our feelings or impressions of things are either unclear or incomplete as a result. Pirsig has the ability to express complex ideas clearly and often used examples, metaphors, or paraphrasing to facilitate that."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"ZMM is a milestone work of contemporary philosophy. The metaphors in the book bridge the perceived dichotomy between science and nature. The necessity of embracing technology (metaphor: the bike and keeping it in shape) in order to experience the natural (the journey, sites, experiences, etc.) helps Pirsig make the point that nature and science are inextricably intertwined. This is particularly valid in today's polarized society, and helps make the book as valid as it was when I first read it 15 years ago.One thing I noticed this time around that is more amusing than anything, is the touch of arrogance Pirsig has about the concepts his pre-insanity persona had. He discusses Phaedrus' views on Quality as some kind of philisophical breakthrough, with only mention of one philosopher who even touched on his views (Poincare). I'm no philosophical genius, but the whole field of existentialism is full of thinkers who talk about essentially the same stuff, but just use different terminology.Thats pretty nit-picky though, because all in all ZMM is a great book.

Finally,someone found a way to write about philosophy in a way thatmakes it interesting and accessible to the averagereader... quite an achievement. But it was too good to last.In the second part Pirsig begins to talk about 'quality'and the whole book disintegrates -- because while Pirsighas a genius for explaining the ideas of the greatphilosophers, his own contribution to the field isless than adequate. 'Quality' as an absolute concept,an objective measurement, a new dimension? C'mon, giveus a break! 'Quality' is as culturally-bound,subjective, nebulous as you can get. You have to be avery insular American to think otherwise.The third part of the book, Pirsig's adventures inacademia, reads like the diary of a crank.

In particular, the author explains the contrast between Plato the idealist, and Aristotle the empiricist. There's also a (scanty) discussion on the tussle between dialectic and rhetoric.Unfortunately this otherwise well-written book can't serve as an introduction to Greek philosophy and rhetoric. A student should get hold of Plato's \\"Gorgias\\", Aristotle's \\"Rhetoric\\", and Vickers' \\"In Defence of Rhetoric\\" for starters. The history and development of rhetoric is worth studying in depth and has relevance today, even though historically it was eclipsed and overshadowed by philosophy.

An ideal first step to becoming one of the individuals that makes an effort to go on this search is to read Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance. One of the deepest, most profound works ever written, the book takes you on a journey of a who that searches so deeply into the mind that he eventually loses his, and takes on the personality of the narrator. The narrator then goes on a journey with his son, Chris, to discover a greater understanding of what his alter-ego, Phaedrus, was looking for. Along the way, we ponder deep, philosophical questions, most notably \\"What is quality?\\" and the split between the underlying function of things and what they appear to be on the outside (classic vs romantic). The ideas to be sparked, the questions to be asked further, and the deeper and deeper levels of the mind to be pondered after reaading this work will go on for thousands of years.

Much like laughing at that girl who asked me out to prom, having waited so long to read this book is something that now makes me scratch my head -- why didn't I pick this up sooner?I first heard of Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance from Peter Egan's \\"Side Glances\\" column in Road and Track. He mentions it now and then with approbation and a slightly conspiratorial tone, like he is talking to a very specific but special readership whenever he mentions the title. This book is not about motorcycles (though it stars one) and it is not about Zen (though it does get mentioned). It is basically a philosophy dissertation -- a Chautauqua, as the narrator puts it -- assisted by the story of a man and his son crossing the country by motorcycle. Sometimes the narrated events provide concrete examples of the theoretical topics of the philosophical discussion, and sometimes the events are thinly veiled allegories for the journey through the narrator's thoughts. But at all times this is an absorbing book that tackles such huge issues, with such analytical zest, that you wonder why more people have not read it.All superlative praise aside, this book is not for everyone. If you find that you prefer dialogue to monologue, feelings to thoughts, and extroversion to introversion, I recommend that you read something else. ZatAoMM is not for narrow attention spans.

But once you do, watch life's Gordians knots fall apart.Thank you Mr. Pirsig, for your intellectual pit-bulledness in the face of Plato's inversion.The book's highly rich parallel structure is poetically satisfying.Why did the author collapse? He paralyzed under two fundamental reversals at once: philosophical conversion to Quality from Truth, and, moral conversion from power to \\"mu\\"?My opinion is that if he had been in the right hands at the time, he would have pulled out ok, ie, without the shocks.P.S.: It's Monism."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"... and, maybe, will never end.This book caught me in this time of my life when I was &quot;trapped in a crossroads&quot;: Too many options, too few means to take the right decision.

Gradually I started to feel more and more trapped, spending all of my time thinking about the &quot;ideal solution&quot; so that no time was left to actually IMPLEMENT it.This is a whole deal of frustration. And then, a good friend of mine told me &quot;you know what? You remind me very much of Phaedrus&quot;.

Same everything.So is there a perfect truth? Absolute truth? Utopia? &quot;The Perfect Quality&quot;? The perfect road?

Before he was this hippy motorcyclist he was \`Phaedrus', Professor of Rhetoric. This mechanism allows the author to philosophise behind a mask that can never be criticised. (It also allows him to come to a not particularly satisfying culmination to his rider's journey.) Having set this up, his addled-brain hero rants about the need to define perfection. This is not to say that this is not a well-written book, or than the overlying story about our hero and his son is not of interest - but the underlying stuff does get exceedingly deep in a philosophical sense, where the subject matter is hardly something of life-changing importance and one wonders if the effort to understand it all is really worth the effort. In fact, the philosophical bits can, in truth, get to be rather boring, and one feels racked by guilt if any attempt is made to skip them, lest some important clue about the true nature of the narrator comes through. It proves to be a very long journey! I would refer the reader to a much more rewarding philosophical journey, equally as good in exercising the mind, and one in which there is actually a significant philosophical outcome. Try \`God, Science and the Cosmic Jigsaw' by Jonathan Kingsley. This provides a very thought-provoking bridge between science and religion.

I'm sure Mr Pirsig means well, and there are a number of passages in his book (well, 2 or 3) which caught my attention, but when I'd finished I was left wondering what all the fuss was about. Essentially, having put the book back on the shelf, I can readily understand why 121 publishers turned it down. (What I find harder to understand is why no.122 accepted it!)

The tortured internal philosophical ramblings boarder on absolute schizoid nonsense, and offer no usable wisdom for happiness, enlightenment or remotely practical living, thinking or being.This book's endless pages of densely packed type have been fawned over by slack-jawed English professors for far too long. They are impressed and frightened by it's rambling inscrutability, and then jump on the &quot;Wow! What a powerful and enlightening book!&quot; bandwagon that they see all their peers clinging to. Don't believe the hype.It reminds me of another piece of New Age trash I read a while back about a woman who left her family and children to persue her 'Zen quest'. Pathetic. These people are more spiritually clueless than anyone, and yet they get bandied about as heroes. The secrets to the wisdom they seek are right in front of them the whole time, and yet they run (in the guise of 'sacrifice' or 'letting go'), and expect the rest of us to applaud and admire them for doing so.No applause here."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"I knew nothing about the author or the book when I first bought it, it just looked good.

However, he covers too much material and it's all wrapped up in a quasi-fictional story that frankly is quite boring. If you're looking for a bonding experience about a man and his son, while they address philosophical concepts and everything, I'm sure there's other fiction authors who do a much better job and are known for their great works.

It is not really about Zen, or motorcycle maintenance (although both feature fleetingly). The new sub-title \\"an inquiry into values\\" is laughable marketing too.

I had meant to read the book for quite some time, I had heard rave reviews from friends, and I believe that the book had even appeared on one summer reading list I had received in high-school.I was shocked by how bad the book was. First, as a book, it is gramatically a mess. Normally, this would probably be of little import for a &quot;book of ideas&quot;, but Robert M. Pirsig was apparently a professor in a university English Department, consequently, he ought to know better.However, and more importantly, the substantive content of the novel struck me as not only poorly reasoned, but somehow ominous. Mr. Pirsig initially gets stuck (for lack of a better term) on the fact that he cannot define &quot;quality.&quot; He refuses to accept that the term quality is refers to an essentialy subjective measurement. Consequently, he searches for an objective definition of quality. Failing he decides to reject the &quot;dichotomy&quot; which would divide the universe into objective and subjective views, and refuses to give the word any definition. He then decides that quality is the meeting of the objective and the subjective, the moment at which out subjective desired meet the objective universe and cause all creation. The Tao, except formed from human desire.First, &quot;quality&quot; does in fact refer to a subjective characteristic. Something is considered of high quality if it does what the observers want it to do. Second, I do not think that Mr. Pirsig is justified as characterising modern views on the objective and the subjective as a dichotomy. That would imply two equally valid views of the universe. There is in fact only one, the objective, the term subjective refers to the fact that we can see only a small portion of the objective universe, and only from one angle at a time. The subjective view of reality is not a viewpoint that competes with the objective, it is that incomplete portion of the objective universe to which any person had access.Finally, Mr. Pirsig's definition of quality struck me as ludicrous. I do not believe that there can be a meeting place between human desires and the objective universe, our desires, like we ourselves, are part of the universe, viewed objectively. Further, it seems the height of arrogance to argue that the motive force behind all creation is our subjective desires. Were that true nothing would have been created prior to human beings, and nothing is being created outside the sphere of our influence. Neither is true.Finally, I found Mr. Pirsig's style extremely grating. In every instance in which a person dared disagree with him, Mr. Pirsig immediately attributed the fracture either to some secret motive, or to the fact that his opponent lacks the intelectual independence to see the truth. The thought never occurs that his detractors may have a point. Ultimately, I do not think Robert Pirsig was interested in any sort ot dialectic, or any forward moving debate, to do so would require he grant creedence to opposing viewpoints. Mr. Pirsig seeks followers.All in all, I think the book was pedantic, poorly written and poorly thought. Mr. Pirsig's own ego provides to great a road block to allow him to make any serious inquiries into values, or into anything else."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"The author constantly defends his head games by trying to explain why people dislike head games, but this does not make the head games any more palatable.

Reality, the white whale, or rather, the ghost of rationality, manifests itself as the insuperable and the innocent so cleverly in this book and yet, through the archeology of memory, time too is added into the formula. Is the &quot;inquiry&quot; skimpy or economic? A second reading made me see that the unnecessary development of certain theories through both the narrative and the analysis were bogging the true ideas down so much that synthesis is literally impossible in such a short space. And so, philosophically, the book contributes little. But then, taking the narrative events and the rather intriguing semiotic treatment of memory, an artistic lustre becomes apparent.

It had no effect whatsoever on me, absolutely ZILCH. It started off slowly, dragged its way through the middle and just fizzed at the end. (Newsweek talked about its 'shattering final pages'. Help!

The only thing it DID do was make me wonder why certain books receive universal acclaim, with nary a word of criticism spoken against them, and the answer's simple: king's new clothes syndrome (no doubt you'll be able to think of some others yourself).The most moving part of my copy (the 1984 edition) was the author's afterword, which touched a chord that the previous 373 pages never came near to doing. Perhaps if this had been a foreword, I'd have seen the text in a different light, in view of the personal tragedy which befell the author.Ignore all the hype.

This book, however, just left me thinking \\"What WAS I thinking?\\" I can not fathom how it spoke to me or why I liked it. The underlying plot was just a thinly disguised means of rambling about the author's self-important ideas. It didn't take me long to get bored with both the plot and the philosophy. My personal philosophy of quality led me to abandon this book before the end."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"What a mess. Juvenile egomania with its occasional fervid appeal but overall Ayn Rand-ian laughability. The good points--most notably that the scientific method actually expands hypotheses rather than eliminates them (or creates them at a faster rate than it resolves them)--are buried amid macho-rebel gunk notable for a peculiar degree of lack of insight and self-awareness. Quasi-autobiographical road trip format is pure padding. Again, there are several strong points in here (though only a few are original) and I tend to agree with some of its anti-academic viewpoints, but ultimately this says more about maniacal egotism than anything else. Oddball helter-skeleter thinking communicated through many would-be guru-isms.--J.Ruch"},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"This book just blew me away.......it is one of those books you buy on a whim thinking hey maybe its good but once you get into it you can't put it down."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"The book is good, however, I would not recommend ever buying any products from the company I purchased this book from- (greatbookdeals)...

The last time I read it was years ago, so when I saw the unabridged version available I jumped at it. Michael kramer's relaxed voice brings the text to life, and allows you to focus on the themes and deeper meaning of what Robert Pirsig has to say. The narrative weaves effortlessly between travelog, personal history and zen philosophy, providing insights and posing questions that challenge and stimulate. Everybody I have persuaded to read this book has been really glad they did, but this version takes much of the effort out of enjoying this important and reflective work."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"This book was a revelation to me when I read it for the first time about 10 years ago, in my mid-thirties. The best part was the examination of \\"quality\\"; the breakdown of the romantic and classical viewpoints was brilliant. I'm a motorcycle rider and sometimes tinkerer, so the motorcycle tinkering parts were fun too. How the story of the ride, and the author's examination of his lost memories gets intertwined with the quality and motorcyle maintanance is totally cool... almost insane (but that's the whole point, right?). This was a flash-in-the-pan effort - it is my understanding the author never acheived anything again like this hit."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"ZATAOMM is a philosophical train of thought to question the meaning behind the meaning. 'Quality' is the term that Robert Pirsig uses to explain the unexplainable. If the previous sentence sounds too philosophical then skip this book. 'Zen and the Art' is a brilliant explanation not only about the source of happiness, but also about the source of the thought where happiness was formed.It gives me encouragement to realise that sitting in a classroom with teachers whose purpose is to indoctrinate not to teach and learn together may not be the ideal growth experience.I completed my reading of the book last night and many of the ideas, morals and guidance are yet to sink in.ZATAOMM is a classic and beautiful narration for the philosophically minded."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"One might think the title of the book is contradictory or at best misleading for this book is not for technician repairing or riding motorcycle at all. But once closing final page, you should conclude that the title makes sense. The author&iexcl;s question is &iexcl;what is the reason or principle in relation to the life?&iexcl; the law of nature or principles of the world, those are the one the science seeks to find. But those are abstract and empty in its nature. Zen is the method to transcend that abstractness to concreteness of life itself. Principles are abstracted from the rich context of concrete life. But once abstracted, we forget where it comes from. Zen asks us to find principle in the life by ourselves.The author show the point of Zen in the form of novel. Motorcycle is the product of engineering and science. So it&iexcl;s the result of principle-seeking activities. But motorcycle could not be rid with just knowing scientific principles. Moreover, it doesn&iexcl;t need those knowledge at all. Just like riding motorcycle, living through everyday life doesn&iexcl;t need knowing abstract principles. Principles needed in life is concrete one put in practice. Zen is the method to find principle in practice."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"What can I say one of the smartest things Ive ever done was reading this book,its chock full of insights and philosophy of why late 20th century living is the way it is.I was mesmorized from beginning to end.

I blame this more on me than the author, and would just like to tell the casual reader to stick with it. I found that towards the end everything came together really well and finally made a lot of sense. I wanted to start over now that I know where it's going, and apparently (judging by the end notes in the book) a lot of other readers feel the same way.So I'd say stick with it, and you'll find it's really a great, great book."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"He's Robert and Phaedrus.Learn about your dual personas.Learn about the distinctions betweenDynamic Quality and Static Quality.Not a book for repair people but fordesign engineers, for people who wantto philosophize about life!It's about Love; familial love!It's about adventures in psychology and philosophy.It's about the Journey.You'll enjoy Lila as well!Into to Philosophy.Learn how to live dynamically, now!It's a story about a man, his motorcycle and hisson and their journey to spirit!"},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"I had to read this book for summer reading for my sophomore ap world history class.

The worst book designation goes to Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance because it is extremely, extremely, over-rated. I found it to be one of the most self-absorbed, self-pitying, whining complaints I had ever been exposed to - and I know about those, because I'm a former junior high school teacher.Not only did it not contain any philosophical insights whatsoever, the book is just plain boring and badly written. The only book I have ever thrown in the garbage can - it's just rubbish, and that's where it belongs. I'm sure the author is a fine human being. I just think he wrote a very, very, bad book. Please don't waste your time on this book."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"The worst book I have ever read!

I will never spend another dime on another book written by Robert Pirsig, ever."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"I agree with all the 1 star reviews here, which make for fun and rewarding reading, unlike this over-hyped waste of paper. At 88 pages I cannot and will not read another word. After all these years, and so many people telling me I had to read this, I finally picked it up at a used bargain book store, and I want my dollar back. The author's ramblings on motorcycle maintenance are sleep inducing, unless I suppose you enjoy motorcycles, and all this massive book is, at least from the first 88 pages I have suffered through, is a boring road trip, void of any sign of plot, used as an excuse to paste on philosophical rants, which make me think a root canal is not such a bad thing after all."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"Ugh. This book can't decide what it wants to be. Every time you get interested in a topic (and this book does contain some interesting topics from the travel narrative to some of the ideas expressed) it switches over to another topic before resolving anything. This is incredibly frustrating from the point of view of entertainment. Does this book want to be a novel and flow like one, or a middle-brow discussion of contemporary worldviews, or a amateur philosophy thesis? It suceeds only in being a very long and slow 400+ pages of several seperate books thrown together with minimal integration."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"Good book but you have to engage your mind to keep up with it."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"Are you intelligent? If you answered &quot;yes,&quot; then this book is for you. Because you're not, and maybe it will help you. If you said anything other than &quot;yes,&quot; avoid this book. The reader's guide to this book says that it has something for everybody. This is true. But something for everybody stinks when you think about it as an individual. Who cares what's there for others? What matters is what is there for one individual, and it isn't much. Less than one would get from a ten minute conversation with an intelligent person. For me, there was a section ranting about universities which I quite enjoyed. But that was about ten pages. Wasting hours of time on hundreds of useless pages is absurd. Reading the Tao, a motorcycle handbook, and a seriously flawed psychology textbook will provide far more insight and knowledge in far less time than this book possibly can."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"This is a layman's, cop-out guide to philosophy... what a joke.

It was written during a time when the boomers (I'm one of them) were looking for meaning. Having gotten out of the military about the time this book was published, I came home to a USA that was far different than when I left it. Drugs, anti establishment rhetoric,etc. I tried my best to assimilate. Having been a motorcyclist and having studied Buddhism while stationed in the Far East, I decided to read the book. I thought it sucked. The author appeared to me to be self absorbed with little regard for his son or anybody else. He rambled on about quality but couldn't seem to grasp what it was. I'll bet that trip was probably the first real adventure in his life. I can't believe people spent money to go to college to have this guy teach them. He can be thankful for tenure. I believe this book was successful because it was published shortly after the cult film \\"Easy Rider\\" was released that made motorcycling popular. BTW, I wonder how into many languages it's been translated. It's not an international best seller I'll bet. Bottom line, I would instead rather shorten my life by the amount of time it would take to read that book again, or far better yet, ride my motorcycle instead."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"This book makes be feel like an idiot. I bought it about a year ago and read it about a year ago (just now getting to do reviews) because I'm a gear head and also because this book is supposed to be so monumental. I have no idea what the others are getting out of it. I'm giving it two stars because the author at least knew a little about motorcycles. I do understand that the motorcycle maintenance is just a metaphor for quality and striving to be better. But at least the motorcycle parts are somewhat accurate.I think you have to be a certain type to like this, into the whole zen thing. If your not, then this won't win you. It is unbelieveably boring. Beginning, middle and end. If it were a new book, I would have put it down after 30 pages. But I read it because I THOUGHT is was SUPPOSED to be so important and enlightening. The ending, if that's the right word, was a huge let down. Nothing happens in this book. May that's zen. Nothing witty, nothing enlightening, nothing important, and no conclusions made.Please don't blast me for a negative review. I respect others liking it. But I would not recommend this to fellow intelligent gear heads who find beauty in building and maintaining things."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"A friend recommended this book to me after he learned I was going on a 1200 mile motorcycle trip. I never did take the trip, but read the book anyway.I found his monologues on quality boring and bordering on insane (he was insane, after all). After wrestling with this part of the book, I decided to focus on the trip, not the lecture. Some of his writing was very visual, though I found his conversations with his son troubling and sad, especially towards the end.This was not a satisfying read, though perhaps because it is so highly viewed seemd more of a disappointment."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"I managed to get the whole way through on my second attempt at this odd book - hard core philosophical discussion mixed in with the narrator recalling his past life as an insane philosophy-seeker mixed with the story of a road trip.The philosophy is so involved that it is esoteric and actually usually boring rather than mind expanding. And there is very little Zen!! It is hard to feel for the central character - he seems so interesting until he starts becoming so invovled in mind numbing minutiae. But there are some great sections on the riding and the 'art' that can be found in 'non-art' activities like motorcycle maintenance."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"To be honest, this book's popularity amazes me. I first read it when it came out in 1974-I was 21 and in college-and, despite the fact I liked the book a lot I couldn't fathom how it ever became a mass market success. Here we are 28 years later and it's in the Top 1000 Amazon sellers. Amazing.Obviously, if you've read previous reviews, you realize this is a divisive book, seen as either revelatory or insipid.The book is heavily philosophical in tone, but at heart it's about finding your allegorical life device. (Had the book been written 20 years later, we'd have used the term paradigm.) For this character, it's motorcycle maintenance. That's not particularly profound, but then, really, not much in life is when you get right down to it.I think a big part of the problem is that people forget this is fiction Admittedly, it's heavily autobiographical and pretentious fiction, but fiction nonetheless. This isn't Bertrand Russell or Kant or Martin Heidegger writing an academic tract meant to profoundly influence the world of philosophical thought. Moreover, anyone who went to college must have somewhere along the line been exposed to a similar character-someone full of his own importance and questions and semi-educated the way undergrads are in philosophy, perpetually blowing his horn.The other thing that never seems to get mentioned that is, to me, a key element that underlies and drives this story is that early on we learn the man has just gotten out of the loony bin having been subjected to electroshock therapy. The man's brains have been artificially addled and he's trying to put things in some sort of order. An allegorical device makes a lot of sense in this context.On the whole this is an entertaining and thought provoking story-the way that, say, Ayn Rand wrote interesting, thought provoking, heavily allegorical yet somewhat unrealistic stories.If you approach the book in that light, I can't see how you can help by enjoy it."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"The only reason to read this book would be to learn a lesson about avoiding anything that has been hyped too much. This book is not only boring and badly written, it is astonishingly hypocritical: the tone is smug, self-satsified, preaching, everything that Zen philosophy is opposed to! The narrator's painfully inept treatment of his intelligent, sensitive son is all too typical: he doesn't listen, and tries repeatedly to impose his own vision of the world and of what his son should be like on the poor boy. What is Quality, the narrator asks? Well, maybe treating your child as a human being with emotional needs has something to do with it."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"Man was this a waste of time. I had to read this book for class. What was my teacher thinking! Torture... that is what he was thinking.Talk about clarity....how bout none at all!

For those of you who like off and on books I recomend this to you .. Good Luck!!!!"},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"[This review is a composite of 21 student reviews after we completed reading the book in a freshman composition class] The book starts out with a motorcycle journey--undertaken by the narrator and his son Chris--as its focus, but it quickly turns into more of a mental journey, guiding readers through the narrator's inner questions about and quest for &quot;quality.&quot; While the plot is not physically exciting, it is mentally complex and insightful. It makes you think about simple things you may take for granted and asks questions that everyone supposedly knows the answer to but can not express in words. In addition to the narrator's personal, philosophical &quot;inquiry into values,&quot; the book explores the relationships between the narrator and his son, between artistic and scientific aspects of everyday situations, between sanity and insanity, and between the motorcycle (as a machine) and us (as people). Such concrete examples can help readers, yet the book is often redundant, confusing, and vague. Patient readers may find Pirsig's views on quality, discovery, truth, and life intriguing, but it is also easy to get lost in the many details and tangents in the text and miss the main idea. Some readers may also resent Pirsig's sometimes overwhelming and overdetermined theories. However, for those inclined to lengthy analysis and inquiry into our common ways of seeing the world, this may be just the right book."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"I read this years ago when I was in college, and spent a good amount of effort with a highlighter, rereading and cross-referencing, trying to figure out the Big Message that this book kept threatening to deliver. Well, there isn't one. It's (useless nonsense) philosophy as fiction, and not much satisfying on either count. If you want a measure of enlightenment from motorcycle maintenance, buy a motorcycle that doesn't run and fix it up like new."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"11/20/10 Zen and the Art of Motorcycle MaintenanceI've heard of this title and found it in the biography section of our library. The rave reviews encouraged me to read it.The story is of a man and his son who set out on a motorcycle trip across the upper West and Northwest eventually coming down the coast to California. The man is schizophrenic and interspersed with the travelogue are musings of his other personality (Phaedrus) on everything from motorcycle maintenance to Greek philosophy.Chris, his son, has problems of his own - mostly in dealing with the terrifying illness of his father. As the book progresses that travelogue sections grow shorter and long ramblings on philosophy and meaning-of-life take over.I found myself identifying with the son Chris throughout the book. It was a long joyless ride. I found myself slightly depressed everytime I read a portion. I was glad when I finished. I almost quit a few times but wanted to push through to the end. If this is Zen philosophy I want nothing to do with it. \\"the road became so dark I have to turn on my headlight now to follow it through these mists and rains.\\" (pg 491)"},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"&quot;Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance&quot; is a book just as long and boring as its title. The story starts out like any good book, and its first few chapters introduce some interesting ideas about different philosophies for viewing the world. At the end of Part I, the reader is anticipating a good read, and Part II delivers quite an interesting journey of a strange man, Phaedrus, who is about to go insane. Then the unsuspecting reader is hit with Part III, the attempted definition of quality, which actually is an incredibly long rant on something so irrelevant that it is almost a burden to read. Pirsig's obsession with quality grows annoying very quickly, and progresses into a long, drawn out overdramatization of the time right before Phaedrus went insane. Those readers who actually stick with the book until the end are hit with a fairy tale like ending which leaves many questions unanswered. I would only recommend this book to someone who has a lot of time to kill or has an overriding interest in things completely irrelevant to everday life."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"Do you enjoy the intellectual depth that greeting cards provide?

How could so many people give this book high reviews, when \\"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance\\" is a: dull, boring, clich&eacute; ridden, stupid, meaningless, whining narcissistic, arrogant, self-indulgent, self-satisfied, self-absorbed, self-involved, self-important, pretentious, condescending, authoritarian, preaching, ranting, rambling, obsessive, myopic, insane, heavy, confusing, excessively difficult book!! To me ZMM is over rated tedious, contrived, and artificial! How can people be so enthusiastic re ZMM? I don't get it!! I just don't get it!!!!\\"On 10 Mar 06 there were 457 Amazon Reviews available. Of these reviews, the vast majority, 327 (70%), were quite positive and enthusiastic and rated Four Stars or Five Stars! However, 87 reviews (19 %), were negative or super negative and rated with One Star or Two Stars. Their combined words (above paragraph) reflect their frustrated angry feelings in no uncertain terms!!!! I deduce that most of these persons tried to read ZMM because they had received very strong recommendations from many people. They were expecting to be similarly rewarded. The Amazon ZMM negative review authors have an additional ego defeat. In the process of adding their review to the Amazon ZMM Web Page, they no doubt couldn't resist reading some of those glowing \\"Four & Five Star\\" ZMM Reviews, which are 70 % of all reviews. The Amazon ZMM negative review authors quickly learn they are in the minority, and this adds to the insult because they are totally blocked in their understanding of ZMM, and they don't know what is wrong with their own abilities!!They've \\"had it\\" and want to tell the world that the author (or the ZMM Narrator) is in no uncertain terms, the locus of their problem. These Amazon Reviewers are clearly intelligent readers and generally enjoy books. They are even well enough put together to write a coherent description of how they were lost despite their intensive struggled with the book! There are an estimated 200,000 turned-off frustrated ZMM readers!! (i.e. 19 % of the ~ 4 million copies of ZMM circulated since publication in 1975.). So what's going on!!!?To see my longer analysis of the One and Two Star ZMM Reviews follow the instructions at bottom of this review. I continue now with some hi points of my analysis.STRANGE TO SAY, SOME REVIEWERS SAY \\"HARDLY ANY ZEN IN ZMM\\"!!!Of the Amazon ZMM Reviewers, a significant proportion say they expected the book to be about Zen. However when they looked closely for it, they report \\"not finding any\\". They concluded that there is \\"Hardly any Zen in ZMM\\"!To me, Zen occurs all throughout Pirsig's book. I can see it in the ideas presented, e.g. Quality and Gumptionology. And I can see Zen in how Pirsig suggested we use Zen-like behavior in our own lives. Also the Narrator does and thinks Zen-Patterns in the book, rather that talk about it! This apparently prevents many readers from seeing how Pirsig builds Zen throughout ZMM!Even those persons who call themselves Philosophers (or those that speak strongly from this perspective), have similar inability to see much solid Zen, or sound philosophy, in ZMM. I conclude that a Western Philosophy training (or orientation) alters perceptions so such persons \\"Just Could Not See What ZMM Was Really All About!\\" Part of the problem may be that philosopher personality can't stand Pirsig's folksy, easy going, every-day approach to the philosophy. They get bored fast with Pirsig's (non-Professional non-Philosopher) approach. If you do (or do not) agree with me, please email. I would like to hear what you think is the problem Philosophers have with ZMM.I SHOULD ADMIT THAT I WAS SLOW TO SEE THE FULL EXTENT OF ZEN BUILT INTO ZMM.I had my own illumination, some 5 months ago, when I discovered a very helpful passage on the back of a \\"Tao Te Ching Translation\\". Only then did I fully realize how extensively Robert Pirsig has written the principles of the Tao into in his book \\"Zen and The Art of Motorcycle Maintenance\\". Like Lao Tzu's, Pirsig's Book is to practical guide life and living, .... a hand book for \\"Westerners\\" .... to apply Zen to their lives.

Thus, quality creates everything and that which is not quality doesn't exist. Except for the way it has been presented, this is identical to philosophical monism, and so suffers from the problems of all monisms : that of the problem of explaining the existence of evil. If we admit that evil exists then according to this thesis, it must be created by quality, and thus evil too is quality or else it does not exist. As in all other monisms, this one too ends up explaining nothing, only making way for a \\"Quality\\" cult or religion. In the story, however, there are traces of quality. As the title goes, even motorcycle maintenance requires a touch of art and just as for any art, needs caring. The better part of the book is about this : the need to care; what you do and how you do it. Which is also what Zen is about : a total involvement in and attention to whatever is being done. The development of the quality concept does serve as a reminder to hard core science buffs that the measurable quantity that science presumes as the only substance of the universe, is the actual ephemeral ghost that haunts science and gnaws at the very foundations of western civilization. But his analysis of the problems in his culture are not only way off mark, but also misleading, as is his conclusion about the turning point in western culture. The difficulty is compounded by his attitude of certainity about his beliefs, which he presumes must be and have to be accepted by all. This borders on his being almost fanatical about his beliefs, which makes his philosophy a closed one and not an open inquiry."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"I don't love or hate this book to the degree that most of these reviews seem to indicate.My first and after twenty years continuing feeling about ZAMM is that Pirsig doesn't know where his strength lie.That is to say he's a first rate storyteller!

Too Folksy for my taste. It had been on my reading list for years though, so I read it. If its on yours and you read Walden and did not get much out of Walden, you won't get much out of this either. You really have to be in the right frame of mind, IE stoned. Wish I would have read this then like when I was 20. Oh well."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"Pirsig takes such an amazing approach to this book. He encompasses everything in our modern world. How and why everything we have created exists as it does is explained in this book. The night after I finished it the whole thing came into view and I understood our reality in a new way. QUALITY has become a word with more meaning than I could have ever imagined, and it has become such a powerful word that I cannot even really believe it, but Pirsig lays it all out for all of us to see. READ THIS AMZING BOOK!"},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"by reading the first few pages. If you continue, this book will hold something of value to you.Maybe it's the state of mind you are in. When the book first came out, I was 21, invincible, &quot;right&quot; about my attitudes on every subject, questioned authority and everyone else in the world and the book didn't mean much to me then. Now, I'm near 50, have faced a near fatal health crisis, have a five year old son and am &quot;smarter&quot; or maybe &quot;wiser&quot; and do question myself, my happiness or maybe my own meaning in Life.That IS important now. I am enjoying and learning from this book."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"It seems as though many of the people who have recently reviewed this book missed much of what makes this book great - fascinating philosophic discussion and an interesting story. To really appreciate the depth of this book one should have at least the faintest of notions about the general movements in Ancient and Modern philosophy. While doubtless many will find such discussions boring, which is a sorry state of affairs to begin with, what makes this book excel is that it's not a traditional philosophic treatise - it has a storyline component as well.As a book of considerable depth and well-written fiction, it stands as one of the best books I've ever read. Certainly it's not a book to breeze through, instead, it should be read slowly with contemplation. If you're looking for a quick, shallow read please go elsewhere. If you're looking for an intellectually stimulating read that discussions issues from Hume's skepticism, Aristotle and Plato, and Eastern monism, then you've come to the right place."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"This book has fundamentally changed the way I think. Since reading it (2001) I have quit my law degree (undergraduate) and re-applied for various philosophy courses, in order to pursue Pirsig's 'metaphysics of Quality'. I'm not suggesting that the book will have the same effect on anyone who reads it, but it will nevertheless challenge your preconceptions and I think that my experience should give rise to at least a little curiosity....."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"You won't remember every word you read in this book.I know this, because I tried. Pirsig's novel is an autobiographical musing on quality and a study of the reconciliation of technology and man. Every page is frustratingly thoughtful, and I've read it over and over again in order to gleam what I can from it.I won't even begin to delve into the lessons this book provides. That would cheapen the narrator's physical and philosophical journey, and rob you the benefits of a thorough examination.But please, follow the example that Phaedrus provides early on. Step back, and allow yourself to perceive the benefits of the book. While it is certainly complex and requires massive amounts of attention, Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance provides excellent insight on both perspective and our personal search for understanding."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"An enjoyable book. A good read, and Pirsig has some very good points.But still: the author sets out to define \\"quality\\". It is the whole purpose of the book and the journey. And he ends up saying that it can't be defined!Quality is not that hard to define. It is simply \\"how well something works according to its purpose\\"."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"This book is certainly a good book that engages one at many levels. And i'll agree with the other reviews of it generally, but i would just like to point out that the view he puts forth of what Zen is, of what the Phaedrus (by Plato) is about and who the sophists were is completely off base. His ideas are good but where he says he gets the ideas from is just poor study of the sources."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance contains two works -- one, a philisophical inquery into the nature of being, including references to Zen and the Tao; the other, a story of a man and his son treking across country on a motorcycle, revealing our narrator's past, and eventually resolving certain conflicts within himself. The more traditional &quot;story&quot; is independant enough from the intelectual &quot;chataqua&quot; (as the author terms it) that either is worthy of individual enjoyment, but they are so artfully connected that the combined effect is greater than many times the sum of its parts.This book deserves the term &quot;classic&quot; because it was crafted with a certain Quality, that empowers it to enrapture readers, effect lives, alter thought patterns, and -- as all great art should -- reveal a certain truth, and the beauty within that truth. All the praise that I could bestow upon this book would not make up for the benefit I have recieved from it. I love Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"Are you into soul-searching? Do you think about your place in the world? How do you deal with technology and remain sane?If you have ever asked yourself some of these questions, you're in good company with Pirsig's classic book on &quot;What is Quality?&quot; He'll make you think about what makes something enjoyable. The book is academic in tone, and difficult to get through, but it's not a novel, so what did you expect? It's depth-charged. It doesn't sugar up the prose just so that it's easily digestable, but if you're going to read only one philosophical book in your life time from cover to cover, make this the one book you read.On my essential and must-read list."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"Every spiritual seeker remembers the book which set them upon the path. Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance was mine. Pirsig asks students to step out of their four-walled classroom into his Church of Reason, in which quality is the state of things, of motorcycle repairs, and of life itself to be sought."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"Before I bought and read the book I had read many of the reviews herein. I must have missed it because I didn't come away with nearly as profound of an impact and impression as many here have felt. While intriguing (I kept looking for something new) I was mostly disappointed by the over and over again commentary on \\"Classical v Romantic\\" thinking. I got it the first time; didn't need to re-read his position on it dozens of times. I found the book to be very convoluted in its presentation, and I think reflects the author's own convoluted thinking and confusion about philosophy. If you're not a student of philosophy and familiar with the works of the great ones, I think this book fails to make its mark, in that I found it not very profound, about anything, frankly.I found the story of his relationship with his son, actually, to be more interesting, yet that's not why I bought the book.I thought his leanings towards Oriental philosophy to be somewhat dated at this time, a 1970s thing (of course, at the time it was current).I wasn't impressed enough to want to buy any other of his books or the study guides (any book that needs a study guide, in my opinion, is not well written). IMHO."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"Despite the high brow reviews by self proclaiming philosophers and intellectuals who think this is a book about philosophy, it is not. It is also not a \\"how to\\" manual on maintaining a motorcycles.This is a book about overcoming intellectualism and becoming whole. If you are contemplating reading this book please disregard the reviewers who flex their imaginary philosophical and intellectual muscle and just read it. Yes, there will be parts that seem to endlessly pursue some thought or idea but by the end of this book you will be very glad and satisfied you read it....of course if you have ever ridden a motorcycle, experienced the landscapes temperature changes, sounds and elements and/or struggled with and beat mental illness this book will take on a special dimension."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"I enjoyed this book in a way far greater than any book I have ever read before. This story makes you think and ponder questions just as the main character is doing. The story is told in the first person and you get a unique view into the mind of a man who is on the razor edge of genius and insanity.I have read this book twice and enjoyed the second read even more than the first. Many insights into the nature of things (don't want to spoil anything for first-time readers).There are many small scenes of perhaps half a page that still stick with me and help me understand the nature of people.I am a better person for having read this and I thank the author for sticking with this book and getting it published where other mere mortals would have given up.The author has his own trials and tribulations and mentions these after the end of the story.I will spend many years, I fear, searching for another book as insightful and enjoyable as this book has been for me."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"This book will become one of my favorites very soon. I'm just finishing to read it.It is amazing how easy the writer drives the story and gets in to deep topics and conflicts of our daily life. That makes the book a great source of common sense and wisdom and makes easier to understand the reality.If you are a person interested into find out the source of many problems or conflicts this book can be very helpful.If you would like to expand your criteria for analysing different realities this book can be helpful.It is a bit too long but it is so easy to read... For sure I will read it more than once to find details I couldn't keep before.I'm even using the book for supporting my work like manager. It helps me to make evident some kind of problems and supports very good the process of finding solutions."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"This is such a good book; it's one of my favorites. I would recommend it to anyone interested in education reform or philosophy."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"\\"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance\\" is an astonishingly good book, even though it's hard to characterize. It's a travelogue, philosophical meditation, intellectual autobiography, father/son story, spiritual quest, and tale of madness -- all rolled into one. Because of the book's ambition, it's easy to take cheap shots at it. For example, it's impossible to deny that the author, Robert Pirsig, is a crank -- who else would believe that he's solved the deepest problems of Western civilization? It's also true that some of Pirsig's details about Greek philosophy and the history of science are wrong -- Copernicus did not, for example, discover that the Earth is round. However, these are quibbles. The overall impression \\"ZAMM\\" leaves on the reader is that thinking is a serious, almost life-or-death adventure. In a culture awash with materialism, fundamentalism, and nonsense disseminated on the internet, that's a huge accomplishment. I can't think of any book that would do a better job of getting an intelligent high school or college student turned on to philosophy. Six stars!"},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"I recommend this book highly. It is an excellent book, although I would agree with other reviewers that it is not an easy read. A man's quest for the definition of quality was of most interest. I found the underlying story of a difficult relationship between a man and his son interesting, but the author definitely teaches the reader a lot more about quality than parenting. With regards to quality, while I did not feel that Pirsig was totally successful in defining quality, he was right on target when he defined it's source. The core message and fundamental heart of the book was Pirsig's commentary relative to quality coming from people who care. Peace of mind according to the author is not superficial to technical work (and this could be extended to all types of work), it is really all that matters. It is produced by good work and destroyed by bad work. Specifications, measuring instruments, etc. are all tools to help satisfy the peace of mind of those doing the work. Knowing that the people who did the job care about what they are doing gives one the peace of mind that quality work has been accomplished and that a quality product has been made."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"I just wanted to say that although this book is a work of great importance and genius on its own, and can be very valuable without any knowledge of zen, an understanding of some zen principles can bring on a whole new level of comprehension of the book (and no, you dont have to be a buddhist for this to help). A good place to start is with the writings of d.t. suzuki. Although his writings are many years old now, the language is timeless, and his simple, reverent style is very readable. Read his Introduction to Zen, and then read this book again. Youll be amazed at what you missed the first time around."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"I finally read 'Zen', one of those books that nags at you for years before you've even read it. Every copy I've ever run across is dog-eared, warped from water and tinged brown from time and the smoke from fire places and camp fires. Here is my take: Pirsig's entire \\"inquiry into value\\" (a subject which he seems to take too far, and no wonder he goes a bit nutty trying to subdivide and take the subject to its logical end, when there is no logical end, because it is largely subjective in my opinion)was less important to me than his stark look at his own weaknesses and eventual madness, which he recovers from by being, at least in part, a different person. That he does this gradually, teasing us with glimpses through the looking glass to the thoughts and doings of 'Phaedrus', is gripping. I empathized with Pirsig's railings against the system, although his intellecutal arrogance perhaps stopped me short of complete sympathy. But I really admired him for facing himself this way - it is harrowing and kind of beautiful - and his realization in the end, when for a crucial moment he gets out of his head and sees what has been before him the whole time - really gave me the shivers. This human oddyssey, of a man too intelligent for his own good, is what I think makes 'Zen' an extraordinary, special book that stands on its own and will for many decades to come."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"Read this book. Talk about it. Share it with your friends. This book is more important than one thinks at first glance. I have read it 5 times over the past 25 years, first as a teenager thinking it was about motorcycles, next as a Philosophy major at Harvard, and each time I have gotten something new out of it. It is more than a travel adventure. It is more than a father/son reconciliation story. It is more than an autobiographical odyssey of psychological redemption. It is even more than an &quot;inquiry into values.&quot; This book reveals the greatest crime perpetrated against intellectual history. While Pirsig is concerned with a synthesis of Eastern and Western philosophical traditions, he points us to the violence done by Plato in his attack on the Sophists. Until Plato, Philosophy was a part of the common life. Sophists wandered the Greek world offering instruction (for pay) in rhetoric and Philosophy, and this was deemed the normal course of life. Even Plato's revered Socrates conducted his discourses in the marketplace, the agora. The aristocratic and elitist Plato's crime (in my view) was to whisk philosophical discussion away from the agora and put it in the acadamy, where it has remained gathering dust for 25 centuries. His Theory of Forms tells us that few, if any other than himself, can see things as they &quot;really are.&quot; The Republic tells us that only the philosopher-king (Plato himself being the leading candidate) is fit to rule. If all of Philosophy is a &quot;response to Plato&quot; as A.N. Whitehead put it, then we are debating with a traitor to humanity. Nothing is more relevant than a synthesis of the Philosophical and the Practical ways of being, as well as Eastern and Western ways of thinking. I have devoted my life to dragging the philosophical debate back from the academy into the agora where it belongs and where it can be of the greatest good to the greatest number of people. Reading and sharing this book with friends is a wonderful way to begin that pilgrimage yourself. I just wish someone would make a film of it. Can't you just see William Hurt in the lead?"},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"Seeing from the sheer amount of reviews on amazon for this book, I don't know if there is much point in me adding my review to this. But still I would like to say a few things about this book.It is quite simply the best book I have ever read. I should clarify that it is the best book in my opinion, since it was exactly what I needed, when I came across it. It changed my life and gave me new insight and direction in life. It taught me that life isn't all fruitless and futile!All the intellectual pursuits and studies I have done after reading this book have been in some way part of this one. It simply connected everything. It has been the most important book in my life.A note about the sequel, LILA. Do read it. It is a must read after reading this book. Although, poorly written, LILA is a much clearer and down-to-earth philosphy compared to ZMM. It can be better applied to the world, as we know it. ZMM on the other hand gives the reader a complete perspective on things, which is of course of a higher \\"value\\"."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"This book in many ways helped me to piece together many ideas that I have had for some time. One is that the &quot;quality&quot; that Pirsig talks about is the same as Thelema. The key to it all is the realization of the Greek &quot;Arete&quot; which means excellence.The core of this book is excellence of self, and how to acheive that. Some people may not have gotten that aspect, but that is what it is all about. I would recomend this book to anyone. If you enjoy this book, then you might consider reading anything by Aleister Crowley."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"I had heard a lot about this book since I was in grade school, but could never get around to reading it. I finally did read it a couple of years back and I dont know how to express how it went. All I can say is that one must read it. In brief, and only one way of looking at this one is, he is trying to define quality. But that is just a small part of the whole. He is very observant and its a great mix of philosopy with what we feel and he does a great job in patching the rest up. The best part is that its a story and not some text on philosopy. I like his writing style and you will notice all the thought he put into every small detail. Its very carefully written. I particularly liked his expression of gumption. Read it. You wont regret it."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"Reading this book is a life-altering experience. I first read this book 12 years ago, and I have read it, re-read it, and re-read it, and re-read it. I keep coming back to the simple wisdom, the simple truths, and the simple elegance of this book. It is worth every penny, every page, every minute. I found the artificial dichcotomy between the subjective and objective to be a bit simplistic, but for the purposes of Pirsig's argument, they served a useful purpose. This is a book for seekers; while it asks more questions than it answers, the answers it gives are profound and worthwhile."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"Pirsig's narrator relates a picaresque intellectual narrative interweaving 3 metaphoric journeys with his main quest-- coming to terms with his own identity and the meaning of existence. In the present tense, it is his broken marriage and troubled relationship with his teenage son that occupy his thoughts. In the past, he is consumed by his failure as a graduate student at the University of Chicago, which found him at odds with Aristotelian, &quot;logocentered&quot; philosophical traditionalists. At a more timeless level, it is his identification with Phaedrus, the rhetorician whom Socrates discredits in the Platonic dialogues, that consumes him. Against the weight of all Western philosophy, with its influence on &quot;dialectic,&quot; the narrator affirms and finally celebrates his unique identity as Phaedrus, whose search affirms &quot;rhetoric,&quot; the power of the individual to create his own existential truths and construct a sense of identity. In the thrilling climax, the narrator reaches his geographical destination along with the hope of constructing a bridge with his son--not because of the discovery of some ultimate or transcendent truth but because of his own empowerment as &quot;Phaedrus&quot; to create such a truth. Pirsig reviews and critiques the whole history of Western philosophy, then like Nietzsche &quot;deconstructs&quot; it in order to celebrate the constitutive, creative role of the individual in determining the nature of world and self. The book is an unforgettable intellectual journey on many levels, into past, present, future, but don't expect much Zen. It's final affirmation of the individual quest, of the poetic vision of Phaedrus, belongs more in a Western Romantic, than Eastern, mystical tradition."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"Author's note:&quot;What follows is based on actual occurrences. Although much has been changed for rhetorical purposes, it must be regarded in its essence as fact. However, it should in no way be associated with that great body of factual information relating to orthodox Zen Buddhist practice. It's not very factual on motorcycles, either.&quot;When it was first published, in 1974, this little book took the country by storm. It introduced much of America to Zen Buddhism, in spite of the author's disclaimer, above.Ostensibly, it is the story of a father and son crossing the continent on a motorcycle, but of course it is far more than that. It is essentially a journal of a journey of self-discovery.Here is a sample: &quot;Reality is always the moment of vision before the intellectualization takes place. There is no other reality. This preintellectual reality is what Phaedrus felt he had properly identified as Quality. Since all intellectually identifiable things must emerge from this preintellectual reality. Quality is the parent, the source of all subjects and objects.&quot;There is much discussion of the importance of Quality.This book has changed the way many people thought and felt about their lives. It has also led many into the practice of Zen Buddhism.

But then again it is. Travel toward the center of our own self. It is a complex book. To be read in sequence with Zen and the Art of Archery by Eugen Herrigel.The main point of the book is that happiness (or \\"quality\\") can be achieved by focussing on and finding beauty in whatever one is doing at any one moment while keeping a cool head on the way forward. Even listening to the unusual noise of a defective motorbike and looking for a fix can yield unexpected satisfaction. At the same time, fixing the broken bike requires scientific, rational knowledge, thinking.The challenge is to focus on the moment (zen) through a sort of meditative practice of detachment and at the same time never lose sight of where one is going, with (rational) planning for the future.\\"Quality\\" and \\"truth\\" were the same thing for the ancient Greeks, and perhaps they should be for us too.

As it happened it was a copy which I'd lent my father 25 years earlier. Dad died 17 years ago--his own notes slowly drew me into rereading the book, as we both relived Pirsig's journey. After I'd finished the book it wasn't the philosophic conundrum (what is Quality?) that stuck; or his insights into the venal, stagnant nature of contemporary academics (perfectly accurate); or even his emotional journey with his son--which culminates (in the newer Forward, 1984) in his dramatic, though measured retelling of Chris' murder on street in front of the San Francisco Zen Center. For me it was the honesty of the prose that stuck. Without it the rest of the text would have been dry, uninteresting...lacking in 'Quality.' Though Pirsig gives some credit to the ancient Greeks for helping him resolve the puzzle of what constitutes 'Quality'; in reality, it was his own honest reflection...his own unvarnished revelations that revealed what he sought: his own true nature.Even though the book has taken on a different meaning for me since my first reading nearly forty years ago, I believe it's valuable at a variety of levels, and for various kinds of readers. For some it will be a book on philosophy; for others a father and son road trip; for others a study in the workings of the human mind.

It's about the history of philosophy and an inquiry into values. What is Quality? What is Philosophy? This is truly the great american novel. No big explosions or human killings, but a culture bearing book about the dynamic quality of life. I had an interesting experience with the author, 9 years ago. I sent him my graduate psychology paper on &quot;Personality Psychology.&quot; He read inked most of my letters and my paper then sent it back to me. He said do a zen sesshin, and that my work was unfocused. I read his book around 5 times to try to find the meaning of what he said. Since then I'm just beginning to understand the difference between &quot;classic quality or static quality&quot; and &quot;dynamic quality.&quot; This book will help you think upon things deeply. It's not for weary, it's for those who want to challenge themselves and their life with new philosophy and new paradigms."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"The book is difficult to follow over the first few chapters, but don't be put off. This is the ultimate search of a man to find himself, with the most delightful results. Read it!!!"},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"Zen &amp; The Art touches life in the place that most people do not often question. To say what the book is about attempts to capture it within a sphere that is far too rigid for its nature. Superficially, a journey takes place with the reader travelling across America on a motorcycle on a vacation. Inherently, it provides a medium for questioning the nature of our experience. A place to allows us to look at a topic or object for what it is and now simply what our minds make it.Will you find what you are seeking? It is probably best to go in unencumbered of hopes and dreams of expectation. The search becomes am much a part life as the answer that has been looked for.

I was skeptical at first, but I decided to give it a try. That was probably one of the best decisions I've ever made. The book changed my life. I look at things in a completely different light now.

This is definately a book that everyone shoud read."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"An essay into values that transcends the academics of established philosophical rants. No other book so immediately inspires that on second reading one is looking for the catch. The inter-twining of a dark struggle, an honourable quest and the delicate experience of a cautious man dragged me through the other wonders of the book. I have read 'dry' philosophy before and since and I would rather people who wrote about the subject actually cared for it in the way Bob Pirsig does or else just shut up. Often regarded as a hippy tome this book offers more than any self-improvement manual could ever hope while taking one on a thrilling trip.

Once again, I got something different from this great book. ZAMM is inspiring, challenging, difficult, fun, thought-provoking ... it requires you to THINK.

Go figure."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"Had heard abt this book, back in college..somehow slipped my thought for a while. Bumped into this on the shelfs of B&amp;N, picked it up without a second thought...The way the author has dealt with some fundamental aspects of life, its very insightful...definitely not a philosophical take on life..but the mundane things that we see and do in our lifes are dealt with in amazing clarity. Did it change my life? hard to say, but i did bookmark a lot of pages..for future reference. A must read, and definitely worth a re-read."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"ZTAMM was assigned for a graduate level health class because the psychology prof had fallen under its spell in 1974. That was my first exposure to its apparent paradox. Now I am in my turn assigning the book to my classes in diversity. The description of Pirsig's descent into mental illness is what I want my class to get from it. So few people are able to describe how the mentally ill may view the world that the few descriptions that exist offer a valuable tool to those of us who work with mentally ill on a daily basis. As R.D. Laing pointed out, to understand the &quot;journey&quot; a person takes into mental illness is not to become lost in their construction of reality but to develop a greater empathy for them and their families. . A reading partner may help because discussion definitely promotes understanding. Philosophy, English literature instruction, Zen, technology, motorcycle nuts and bolts, father-son relationship--read the book for whatever you can get from it--do not write ZTAMM off as not worth your time."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"This is an amazing read. Pirsig knows how to dig into your head and pull out questions about you. If this book reflects his own thoughts and behavior, he should be commended for exposing the 'black box' within each of us that rarely gets attention. Occasionally, he rambles on a bit long about Phaedrus, and the story drags a little, but overall, very nice piece of work. This book reaquainted me with my desire to read philosophy. I have since read 'Socrates Cafe', which is also a great read along the same lines."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"In grade 12, my English teacher was your quintessential eccentric. Students either loved him or hated him. He always said hate is closer to love than indifference, and given the choice he prefered to have students hate him than not care. Indifference, he said, is the enemy of educationBefore writing this review I browsed through all 218 existing reviews of this book, and noticed that people have intense views--one way or the other--for ZMMWhen I first read this (assigned by that same grade 12 teacher) I hated it. I was 17--what do you expect? I picked it up 7 years later and something about the book clicked for me; I couldn't put it down. It remains one of the most influential book of my lifeThere's a lot of criticism of Pirsig in these reviews--he's a bad parent; he doesn't know anything about real philosophy; he talks too much about philosophy; he's a hippie--and on it goes. Some complain that the book ignores &quot;real&quot; philosophical values, or that it doesn't really talk about how to fix a motorcycle. &quot;Real&quot; zen practitioners state Pirsig is not describing &quot;real&quot; zen.Maybe it's just me, but I believe in things like literature and music, the most important criteria for evaluation is whether or not you like it. Clearly there's a wide range of opinion on both sides here. If you're thinking of getting this book be prepared --you might loathe it. If ZMM is required reading for a course you're taking this is a virtual guarantee--I don't think this is a book that should be forced upon anyone.Remember, this book is a NOVEL--the author makes no claim he's writing a textbook on philosopy or that the facts in this story are 100% factual. If you're going to read it it expect to have strong feelings one way or the other. And if you do hate it, try to avoid personally attacking Pirsig --It is possible to hate a book without ascribing this fact to some deep flaw in the author just because you didn't happen to see the world his or her way. I'd like to think that intelligent debate allows people to disagree without having to get personal, but apparently some of the reviewers here need some counselling to get over the fact that they were assigned this book in university, or that they just didn't like it.Personally, I hate wrestling and Barbra Streisand movies and can't understand why anyone would want to watch either--but apparently people do. It's a wide world out there--with still more than one way of seeing things (I hope)."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, by Robert PirsigFirst Published 1974, 25th Anniversary Edition published 1999 by Vantage / Random HouseReview by Ian Glendinning, February 2002.ZATAOMM is a journey - at least four in fact - two real in the present, one historical narrative, and one metaphorical.The real-time is in fact some 30 years ago - immediately post-hippy era - the book having been published in 1974. The first journey is a cross-US Motorcycle buddy-ride - Easy Rider without the drug culture. The second is a man-and-boy mountain trek - a physical challenge to find themselves and define their relationship - Ex-hippy Walk in the Woods if you like. The third is Pirsig's historical, and painfully personal, autobiography as a student, a teacher, a husband and a father preceding the real-time narrative. Common people and locations link the first three stories, but the fourth, a philosophical argument is woven into all three.As an experience the book moves quickly - chopping between the various threads - dropping clues and hints at the past events and connections to be revealed later, but always leaving enough doubt and emotional confusion to press on. Whilst several threads do get resolved, with a real-life mix of surprise and anti-climax, several remain wonderfully open ended - no-doubt succeeding in provoking the thoughts Pirsig intended.Practically the motorcycle and its maintenance are archetypes for technology, and the qualities of these are metaphors for the philosophical \\"virtues\\". In fact the concept of quality and the ancient debate between rational (logical) and subjective (rhetorical) views of the world are truly the subject of the book. Like Sophie's World the entire book is a vehicle for a serious philosophy text, though unlike that particular best-seller, ZATAOMM provides a gripping and involving story. The emotive power arises from Pirsig's own credentials in philosophical academia as a student and teacher of rhetoric, coupled with the passion and frustration that jumps off the page and grabs the reader by the throat. No surprise to find that Pirsig's schizophrenic alter-ego, Phaedrus, hides a past brush with a mental institution. The frustration of the rational trap, leaving madness as the only apparent escape route is evocative of both Catch-22 and Cuckoo's Nest.For anyone with an interest in the big questions of life, this is a good read. For anyone concerned with making progress in the details of the underlying philosophical debate, it is a text worthy of serious research. Both will find that those threads with uncertain resolution, command at least one re-read.(Reviewers Note: I find myself identifying strongly with the central character, yet when first given this book on an MBA Organisational Behaviour reading list in 1988 I chose not to read it. Now, having read the 25th anniversary edition, I find myself moved by it and regretting that my main thesis did not benefit from it at the time. I am currently conducting research into knowledge modelling.)"},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"What begins as a fairly harmless seeming story becomes more and more of an intellectual adventure as the protagonist rides through America on his motorcycle and shares current thoughts and fragments of his former life.

I was headed for a business career in which little if any philosophical discussion would be had. After reading ZEN, I went to college and graduated in philosophy, and am now headed to law school to study ethical political theories. All the &quot;sappiness&quot; of the tale about Chris only made the story readable for me. It did not bore or disgust me. It made the tough-to-chew metaphysics easier to understand and digest. I certainly allow that one not interested in metaphysical concepts would probably not enjoy ZEN, but no one can deny that ZEN has had noticable impact on the lives of many others -- particularly those who reread it. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"Pirsig's book is pure genius. Even from the standpoint of my Christian ideology I agreed with the bulk of the argument in this book. Moreover, I felt that it was beneficial to my own spiritual life, to my relationship with God, and to my ability to evaluate my Christian walk as I live it on a daily basis. Well-written, captivating, perhaps even &quot;breath-taking&quot; would be an acceptable term, this work has permanently changed the way I look at life. Read it. It's for you. Email me with questions."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"Robert M. Pirsig's semi-autobiographical, philosophical-fiction novel is in several places brilliant. It will give you reason to pause and view life a little differently. Contrary to it's namesake, it is not a book about the ins and outs of Motorcycle mechanics. It is about an approach to life that embraces quality as a virtue and grasping things we don't understand and living with those around us even in a state of turmoil. It's more about life than motorcycles.Sure, Pirsig's tale centers around a motorcycle journey and he definitely has a love for locomoters of the two-wheel street variety, but at it's heart &quot;Zen and Motorcycles&quot; is a high approach to philosophy and ultimately how that philosophy is turned around to care and love for those close to us...our family and friends and how that relationship is to develop even in times of trouble or when family member's face things and problems larger than themselves.Pirsig's alter ego is a character Phaedrus that is waiting darkly in the wings to enter in and wreak havoc. Pirsig as well as his emotionally-challenged son Chris, must deal with this on a motorcycle trip across the states. The afterword provides us with Chris' tragic outcome and the author finds solace in the journey they had together and loved ones that remain. The book may by a little too deep of a trip for a casual read and may not be complete enough for the philosophical gestalt-expectant, but it's worthwhile putting humanity into deep thoughts. Read it. You won't be sorry."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"I was wary of this book at first glance, I saw it in a used book store and figured, hell, it's only 50 cents.I wouldn't take but enough to get a new one if anyone tried to buy it from me.The Author tells of a cross country trip with 2 friends and hs son, continually pondering life itself and likening the human mind to a motorcycle, and how best to maintain it.Theres even an ironic ending that totally threw me back.If you're interested in Bhudism or have been studying it for a long time, this book is easy to understand and the author provides the material in an easy to follow format."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"Robert Pirsig really thinks he has revolutionized the field of philosophy. He seems to believe that his \\"metaphysics of quality\\" amounts to something new, a \\"Copernican revolution\\" he calls it.Thank God he didn't use this book to outline any of that. Whatever the merits of Pirsig's Metaphics of Quality, it should be clear at this point that it's not really as great as Pirsig thinks. If you have really studied philosophy in depth, and have read the authors Pirsig cites in this book (no, this book is not the only philosophy book you should ever read!), you're going to realize that Pirsig has some big holes in his education and some major faults in his philosophical thinking.Again, fortunate for us that he doesn't waste this book on the MoQ. Instead, this book is a Thoreau-like rumination on modern society and its values. We value some stuff we shouldn't, and we place less value on some stuff that we should. Pirsig is excellent at putting cogent arguments together, and many of his points--about the \\"Church of Reason\\" and technophobia, among others--stand truer today than they did then. We Americans are reaching a point in history where we will either critically analyze our values and reject quite a few of them or self-destruct, and Pirsig's book was right on top of that realization even 35 years ago.Is it really philosophy? I would have to go with no. At least, it isn't philosophy in the traditional sense as practiced by Plato and Descartes and Kant. It is more like social criticism, but it is excellent, poetic, beautifully written social criticism, and I really wish Pirsig would get off his MoQ high horse and write some more of it. We could use it right now."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"First off, let me say I can see why this book is considered a modern classic. It delves deeply, and methodically, into the current human condition and how people are taught how to look at the world.However, if you're looking for a casual read into Zen philosophy this book isn't for you. This book took me a while to get through. Much longer than it normally takes me for a book of this length. The \\"rhetoric\\" can be very complex and complicated at times, but it necessary for the depths the book is meant to examine. Pirsig examines the most basic, fundamentaly, and ancient ways of the modern Western Civilzation thought process."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"If you look at the customer reviews for this book you will find the gamut: from people who love this book and whose lives were dramatically changed by reading it to people who have vehement hatred of ever having read (or tried to read) it. If I were looking at this review having never read the book this situation would be clue to me that I should check it out.Many of the negative reviews are from people who had a preconceived notion of what this book was before they read it (either from the title or from a recommendation) and were upset that it didn't meet their expectations. It seems to me that these folks have received their zen lesson...For myself, I came to this book with no real expectations and fell in love with the story, the lessons, and the subtleties of their presentation. It truly changed my life. Since acquiring the book in 1980 I have reread it about 10 times and each time I get something different out of it.My recommendation: Read this book but, before you start, put away any expectations that you have for it. If you can't do that maybe you better wait until you get to a place where you can. There's treasure here but you have to be open to receiving it."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"If you open up to this book, it will change your life and make it much more fulfilling. I first read it in my mid-teens, a time when many people are questioning and searching for what their existence means. Since then, I've read it over four times and as I change, I receive new insights into my life along with Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance. Its a very unique book in that the physical storyline parallels the metaphysical plot and creates neural caonnections within your brain that allows one to do the same with their lives.

J.C.M."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"I tried to read ZAMM years ago and didn't get past the first chapter. My mindset was impatient and I wasn't prepared to think about the issues he was raising. One of Pirsig's classic gumption traps, I guess.Something told me to try it again, so I checked out a copy of the original edition from the library. I just finished the book and now I'm buying my own copy. Prisig is one of those rare authors who can express emotions so subtly and naturally that you actually feel them rather than just read about them. He also has a remarkable way of blending the past, the present and the deep thoughts of two distinct points of view into one smoothly flowing narrative. Just when things might start to drag he switches gears (no pun intended) and lets us all just ride along for a while.This isn't the type of book that everyone will read straight through, or that everyone will appreciate right away. And there's really no reason to force it: Put it down, come back later, read back over the part you didn't quite get. There's no hurry. And when you finally arrive at the destination, the end of that cross-county motorcycle ride, and contemplate the remarkable ideas you've picked up along the way you'll smile, think back, and realize how much you enjoyed the trip.-Bryan"},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"What tripe. This is probably the best selling philosophy book ever, but I'm still trying to figure out what Pirsig's \\"philosophy\\" is. It's got something to do with \\"Quality.\\" That's all I could glean from it. The importance of Quality in our lives is illustrated by this book, which has none. It's said that 147 publishers passed on this before it became a best seller, which should inspire confidence that the waste of enough time will ultimately result in something, kind of like the billion monkeys who type the Bible at random.Pirsig admits this book has NOTHING to do with Zen and NOTHING MUCH to do with motorcycles. If Pirsig really did know anything about Zen he would have burned this book once he'd typed the dedication page.I read this book in 1974 and 1980. and 1994, and 2009---Okay, so I only read it cover-to-cover once, in '74, when I didn't know any better and I thought it was deep. Kids.This was the first \\"Zen and the Art of\\" book, and its inexplicable popularity is reflected in the fact that seven billion subsequent books hijacked the title. About 6,999,999,998 of those subsequent books are better, and should trace their lineage to Eugen Herrigel's ZEN IN THE ART OF ARCHERY which is a great book, and which inspired Pirsig's title. Truth be told, the title is the most memorable thing about this book.What's wrong with ZEN AND THE ART OF MOTORCYCLE MAINTENANCE? Well, it's a long, long boring read. It's also self-indulgent, ego-ridden, rambling, and completely dry. Pirsig's story revolves around a motorcycle trip taken with his son. During the trip he ignores the boy utterly (except to emotionally abuse him), and spends 99% of his time in flatulent speculations on the nature of existence. He's pathologically critical of others and addicted to self-praise and superficial examination of his own problems. Yadda, yadda.I can remember only one moment of any lyric beauty, when Pirsig describes the scent of honeysuckle. The problem with Pirsig's approach is that he's an objectivist first and a subjectivist second. In ZEN AND THE ART OF MOTORCYCLE MAINTENANCE he's trying to write objectively about what are subjective experiences. Trying to make it dance, he ends up with something that clanks when it walks heavy-footed across your frontal lobe.Why then, was this coma-inducing pile of typing so successful? Firstly, it represented the high-water mark of, and epitomized, the \\"Me Decade\\" that gave birth to it. Secondly, it was just dull enough and filled with enough funny names and five dollar words to have readers believing it was really good and they were really dense for not getting it. It remains a biggie because it lives off its reputation as a \\"classic.\\"What this all boils down to is that Pirsig made millions convincing people that they were stupid and that he was smart."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"It has been decades since Robert Pirsig's \\"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance\\" became a best seller, but you can still find a copy in the philosophy section of any chain book store, which would strongly suggest it has achieved the status of a modern day classic in this age of ephemeral phenomena and the eminently forgettable. In a number of ways, it is an exceptional and unusual book.After one has sorted out the different elements, however, separating the personal from the more objective and the entertaining story from the philosophical ideas, Pirsig's solutions seem somewhat weak and one-sided. Because he is never really able to let go of rationality-- except when he carried it to extremes and became mentally ill-- he never finds spirituality. Instead, he finds a concept which lies between the two, and which unites them and combines them to a certain degree, and he grabs on to this concept and builds his philosophy around it, making it the centerpiece of the ideas which he offers up to the reader. This concept is the idea of Quality-- Quality being a combination of right mindfulness and knowledge, of attitude and technique, of values and tools.When a philosopher capitalizes a word, both the reader and the philosopher himself should be wary. Quality is a Platonic-like Idea and Pirsig is something of an Idealist who believes that a motorcycle is \\"primarily a mental phenomenon\\". But as far as connecting Zen and motorcycle maintenance, or transcending spiritual consciousness and technical rationality, the concept of Quality does not pass inspection, make the grade, or win the blue ribbon. Pirsig failed to find the synthesis he was looking for, because he didn't really understand spirituality. His book talks a great deal about motorcycles and very little about Zen. His Phaedrus studied Eastern philosophy in India for a number of years, but never meditated because \\"it made no sense to him\\". After gaining a disappointing intellectual acquaintance with Buddhism, something he could have just as well have obtained from a book, he returned to the U.S., not much the wiser for his experience. Philosophical Phaedrus may have had zenophobia. Then he turned himself into a sado-maso-sophist, asking and answering questions under the hot lights, tightening the mental thumbscrews on his head, and slowly racking his mind on a torturous metaphysical system until he broke, he confessed, he spilled the secret to himself, which was that he didn't really know all those things he thought he knew."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance (which may be the best title of all time) is a bizarre and insightful journey into ... well, psychology, motorcycle maintenance, and pretty much everything in between. This unique book is impossible to classify. Its long-winded tangents into Zen philosophy range from inane navel contemplation to mystical mountaintop profundity.The book begins with a first-person narrative of an unnamed man taking a motorcycle trip from Minnesota to the Northwest with his young son, Chris, and another married couple. The author's description of biking absolutely nails its allure, frustrations, and rewards. His book is required reading for all serious bikers (those who can read, that is). As the journey progresses, the narrator expounds upon the art of motorcycle maintenance and why some shy away from it, dividing riders into two groups: romantic and classic thinkers. Then he spends 100 pages splitting the romantic/classic atom. Surprisingly, the result is not some pot-smoker's rambling, but a sophisticated and well-informed essay on the human condition.The book continues with alternating passages of narrator lucidity--as he describes their mundane travels through America's backwaters--and more deep dives into topics most of us have never invested two seconds pondering: the definition of technology, quality, duality, and Aristotelian reasoning. But Pirsig slowly introduces a third component to the story: a shadowy character named Phaedrus. A mystery develops for the reader. Is Phaedrus a real person? Or a figment of the narrator's imagination? His alter ego? Is the deep-thinking narrator schizophrenic? Or descending into madness?Zen and the Art is at times maddening with its hour-long dissections of trivial matters, but will also have you seeing many things in a whole new light. Apparently, almost nothing in life is as it seems. In the end, it's a &quot;quality&quot; book (you'll have to read the book to understand this). I might have enjoyed it more as a younger, more idealistic person, but it's well worth the time investment at any age. --Christopher Bonn Jonnes, author of Wake Up Dead."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"The reader is led through three stories narrated in first person, each complementary, and all three integral to the success of the book. Firstly, there is a father-son motorcycle vacation with all its problems, solutions and in this case poignant analogies. Secondly, the narrator presents the history of his mental conflict caused by losing himself so deeply in the evolution of an idea, and finally he gives an analysis of the concept of quality and its place in the history of philosophy. This book's brilliance for me is not in the offering of a solution to the multitude of questions that confound so many, but in its well formulated questions and descriptions of situations that the reader is left to contemplate. As an engineer I find that it is often the process of defining the question or situation correctly that creates an understanding that finally leads to appropriate answers. A must read for anybody with an interest in philosophy or the struggle for compromise between art and science."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"Many readers have reviewed this book with a fair degree of criticism for its ramblings and supposedly pretentious tone. Although the overall reception is generally positive, a few things about this book need to be pointed out.Pirsig seems to have written this &quot;Chautaqua&quot; in a diary-like, unedited stream of consciousness style. Parts of it are rough around the edges, rough on the mind. This book will probably be different from anything else you've ever read. Not necessarily for the ideas Pirsig formulates, but for his presentation and his purpose. Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance appears to me to have been written largely for Pirsig's own sake and for his own appreciation. Writing for personal clarification. Of course he states more than once that he also hopes to bring about change across our society. In order to appreciate the book, you have to accept it for what it is - and nothing else.It is not an easy-reading novel, with straight-forward narrative and a moral at the end. It is not a carefully reasoned philosophical treatise. Pirsig seems to fit his years of musings on life and perception and nearly every &quot;big&quot; question everyone has pondered at one time or another, as well as a fair number of specific real-life questions (such as the operation of our education system, and, significantly, (especially for the time this was written) the repulsion of large segments of society to new technology), into an accepted cultural form. I believe he creates the plot he does for several reasons. A plot makes the philosophical ideas easier to swallow piece-meal, the label of &quot;novel&quot; makes it easier to disseminate this work around society, and, frankly, Pirsig's ideas and his dramatic narrative work in perfect harmony.If we as the readers don't relate to and don't actually become Phaedrus and his son from the get-go, the book's point is dimmed in our eyes. The lifting of the fog in the final pages is not just an appropriate literary trick, matching the climactic scene. It is for us. And for Pirsig. Preconceptions of art and reasoning can't just be dropped as we are exposed to new things. But they can be suspended and questioned at appropiate times.Pirsig's ideas may not mesh completely coherently. He may not have the originality of Plato. And maybe his history of Western thought is sketchy. But I doubt he cares. This book is often messy reading and sometimes incredibly lucid and reasoned reading. The ideas of Tao and Quality and &quot;grooving it&quot; are completely appropriate and, to my taste, deliciously presented, if not entirely new articulated concepts for many readers. We should remember the subtitle on this is &quot;An Inquiry into Values.&quot;I think this is more a book portraying one man's mode of perceiving and living than anything. It is challenging and relevant today as I'm sure it was 30 years ago. It INQUIRES into our value system, and that explains its unconventional, conversational format.I have wondered if the title was simply tacked on to attract a Zen-crazed segment of America in the 1970s. But then I guess it doesn't matter. Pirsig doesn't call it Zen BUDDHISM and the, etc. So it is an appropriate title. And if you were attracted to reading this because of smug and shallow appreciation of Zen, then I hope Pirsig's style is accessible enough to deck you and then set you right. And I'm betting that was his hope as well.If we dislike this book because it doesn't correspond to a conventional expectation of a novel or really any other type of work, then is it Pirsig's fault or our own for becoming attached to the expectation in the first place? This is challenging and Quality reading."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"I was rather taken aback when I read the reviews for this one. I was unaware that it was a love-it-or-hate-it book, not when I first read it anyway. Looking back though, I think that very possibly my mind-set at the time brought a lot to bare on my opinion and interpretation of this, Pirsig's most well known work.I vividly remember being on a car journey a few years ago whilst in the throes of a quite unpleasant mental breakdown. I was coincidentally reading the section of the book that dealt with cars. Mr. Pirsig speaks of the framing effect that a car window can have on the view of the outside world rushing by. He compares the effect to a television screen, intimating that, the society in which we live, so driven by T.V., tends to reduce everything to a spectator activity. Even the majesty of the outside world is reduced to the level of a nature program, hence his more breezy choice of transport. It was just one of those great moments that one can find through reading, when you look up from the page you're on and say, &quot;hmmm.&quot; I don't claim that it's an original thought, in fact it's almost hackneyed in this day and age, but it's not the actual conceits in the early part of this book that matter, rather the way in which they are presented. I felt from the car speech and others, not that new ideas were being expounded, just that they were being delivered in a very intriguing way; a sparce, concise way. I like to call this kind of style 'blue'. It's a word I first felt compelled to use when reading Kerouac's &quot;On The Road&quot;. It refers to that brooding, tip-of-the-iceberg intelligence that these writers can convey through the most spartan of sentences. Pirsig, I suspected, had more than just 'pop' Zen to deal with...As I read on, my suspicions were confirmed as Pirsig begins to reveal an entirely different side to his personality. Not even a side, far more another person, a person he names Phaedrus. The name comes from Plato's &quot;Republic&quot;. Socrates, whilst conducting one of his conversational seminars, is confronted by a young man who, because of his particularly intense and confrontational nature, is given the name of Phaedrus-The wolf.This for me was the clincher; not, after all, a pop science/philosophy book, but instead, an intense kind of thriller born of the most complex fear there is, the fear of one's self. That's not to say that the ideas of quality, Zen and motorcycle maintenance aren't tackled with wonderful aplomb, it's just that the real educational aspect of the book comes not from Pirsig's discourses on rotisseries and the like, but through the interweaving of two minds travelling different paths around the same idea. Not to give away the spectacular climax, one mind has a future, the other is history. Me-oh-my, the things we can learn from history.I loved the book, but as I've mentioned, I may well have had a more than usually good idea of where the author was coming from at the time that I first read it. I doubt this explains my affection for it entirely though, and regardless of your mental state, you should give this one a whirl."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"You can read it as a novel, a cross-country journey a man takes with his adolescent son.You can read it as a handbook to good living, advice on how to take on an attitude that naturally leads one toward achieving great results with creativity and passion, bringing meaning to even life's most mundane tasks.And you can read it with its companion, &quot;Lila&quot;, as arguably the greatest philosophical work of the 20th century, creating a whole new Metaphysics from scratch that fundamentally alters our view of reality.No matter how you read it, read it carefully (I've read it three times now and am just starting to really feel like I &quot;get it&quot;). Read it slowly. Savor it like a good meal. It is a work of tremendously high Quality."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"What is good and what is not good, Phaedrus ... need we ask ourselves these things?&quot;Robert Pirsig is HUMAN, and blasts this feeling all over his novel. His duel against the ghost of Phaedrus is an arduous spiritual and intellectual conundrum. His dreams take you on a quest for truth ... about himself, and what it means to be alive. Pirsig's story about a man who comes to find his true self is a story of eloquence, which page by page, reveals a little more of not only the character (and therefore the writer), but also of YOURSELF. His story runs along a journey which encompasses his the grand West along with his son Chris and two friends: John and Sylvia, whom he cannot understand at times.The physical journey however is not even close to the importance of the spiritual and mental journey that Pirsig underwent, and in so doing makes you an active partcipant of the glory of self-discovery.It's a story about losing frustrations over intellectual deceptions, and hidden angers against philosophers, and against the screaming voice of Aristotle through the ages embodied in the division of knowledge into a set spectrum. It's about understanding something which is outside the normal realm of comprehension, a place where chaos exists because there is nothing to explain things with. He needs to find a new Rationality.But overall, as Pirsig invites you to be a speccial member of his mystical METANOIA (rebirth), the participation is caustic, and inaugurates you upon your own journey ... on &quot;a motorcycle called yourself.&quot;This is one of those books that you'll remember when you're on a long road trip or driving home, the kind of book that you'll tell your grandchildren about over and over again. It 's the kind of book that will make you remember it as you go to bed.Frankly, this book changed the way I look at my life and the people around me. If you give it an honest chance, I think it will do the same for you. And generally, that's a very good thing.Enjoy, and Take Scheduled Care of Your Bike!"},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"I read this book for my English class in high school, and I have to admit, the book was surprisingly engrossing for all its technical difficulties. It was indeed an interesting read. However, as a novel, the book contained too much philosophical lecturing to feel like a novel, but too little real philosophy to feel be enlightening. Some of his adventures (however metaphysical) were interesting, though. The author does present an interesting objection to our common senses. Still, almost all the arguments in this book were from sources that I already knew, and there was no real new insight being revealed. I guess the most accurate way to describe my response would be to just classify as an ocassionally thought-provoking book."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"A review of this book by me, or even a thoughtful critique,could add nothing to what has been so well-said in the numerouseloquent essays among the 200 below. Among the decisively best dozen, reviewer Barron T. Laycock, only a few reviews below, describes &quot;Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance&quot; about as well as it need be done. Another finely-drawn perspective is provided immediately below by reviewer Cicha1994, who gets to the bottom of Pirsig's magic of delivering an incredibly complex synthesis with timely spoonfuls of sugar thusly:&quot;Mr. Pirsig has an uncanny sense of timing, and he never allows the heavier passages to labor on too long. This is avoided by craftily interspersing his philosophical discourse amongst very down-to-earth and charming observations made during a motorcycle trip ...&quot;Not daring to venture into the rarified air of the erudite reviews already here, I humbly offer a more fundamental observation, one that is &quot;down-to-earth as fertilizer,&quot; as we say.How I came to read this book the first time -- of how many? -- I can't imagine. I have no interest in Zen, never owned a motorcycle and so needed no advice about keeping one humming. What I found I did have very strong interests in was everything Persig had to say.&quot;Zen and the Art...&quot; was an immediate best-seller when it was published 26 years ago. That couldn't have inspired my interest in it, for I have instinctive misgivings about best-sellers. But I did read it and have been all the better for it. Every subsequent reading has opened a little door or niche missed before.Call any used book store and mention of &quot;Zen and the Art...&quot; and you'll get immediate recognition of it, often a comment like, &quot;Oh, yeah. That Robert Persig book. No, we can't keep them.&quot; Still selling like crazy, after all these years.There is a positively bone-chilling aspect about &quot;Zen and the Art...&quot;. The millions who have read this supreme intellectual and artistic masterpiece -- many, many of whom, like me, were profoundly enriched by it -- came perilously close to being denied the experience. If memory serves, Persig's manuscript was rejected 122 times before William Morrow picked it up (probably after having also rejected it a few times). That says volumes about the dismal state of publishing back then, an industry that is in even blacker depths today."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"I had to read this book for school. So I (of course) thought it would be horrible. It wasn't, and this is a title that every half-conscious human being should read at some point.

I majored in English and have been an avid reader for years. At first, I was put off by the title, but decided to read the book anyway. I am glad I did. Robert Pirsig's book deals with quality and his book is a wonderful, solid example of quality writing. For me, Mr. Pirsig's discussion of quality forever altered the meaning of this word. Like others, I can say the book changed my life."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"This is one of the great pieces of modern literature. Any critic of note agrees, as did the book reading world when it was published. Its success was a bit of a surprise, as it is a deep philosophical ramble for the most part, not your typical best seller. I am both a motorcycle rider and a student of Eastern religions, so this was made in heaven for me. No interest in either of those subjects is at all necessary to love this book, needless to say! More Western than Eastern philosophy here, both are presented brilliantly, and the final stop is pure enlightenment. The extraordinary mental journey that takes place in this book, the agony and seriousness of the author's search for truth, the philosophical heights, the madness, and the epiphanies along the way are all examples of the author's unique genius. The ending has an impact one would not expect of this book. It explodes. This is not one of your typical \\"Zen and the art of this or that\\" deals. This is one of the best books ever written, period. Not an easy read, but more than worth the effort."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"After stubbornly resisting this book for 25 years because of the silly pop culture that surrounds it, I finally broke down and read it last week. No coffee shop, no backpack in the student union - just me and the book in the suburbs. It was good - very good. Did it change my life? No, absolutely not. For a better search on 'what it all means' read Gregg Easterbrook's Beside Still Waters ,and for the fascination with our day to day lives, I prefer the first two Nicholson Baker novels. Nevertheless, I still highly recommend this book. The interspersion of the trip with Pirsig's study of values is quite well done. The Greek philosophy covered and subsequent personal interpretation more than makes up for some of the hippie stuff didn't age all that well. Another plus was the trip itself, which is much better than just about any road book before or since.While my good - but not life altering -review certainly heaps more praise than the one star ones found here, it appears such middle ground is a minority position in these parts. Still, I'll stick with 3.5 stars. Once I waded through the hype and cult like following, I am glad I finally read this modern classic."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"Being the beneficiary (??) of a Great Books liberal arts education, yes, the same one that Pirsig writes about at his time at U of Chicago, one would think I'd be very dissapointed in his work. Not so. Reading this brings to light many of the questions and concerns I've had over the years. It's a shame I wasn't reading this at the time that I was in college, because I was searching along the same paths he was (although I wasn't involved with bikes at the time, more along the lines of dance parties and the occasional search/rescue mission).For those that are entrenched in the classical science vs art dichotomy, Pirsig will shake you up some. But at the same time, he does bring a big revelation to bear: there is Art within Science, and Science within Art. And when we realize that we can indulge in both, we might be able to get back some of that pride in craftmanship that is so lacking in today's world."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"I read this book years ago when it first came out and have continued to mull over the meaning that I found in the story. The more I face life and my internal thoughts, the more I reflect on this philosophical book."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"When I read this book the first time I had several misconceptions about it.My first was that it is a motorcycle travel recount. It isn't. Yes, it has some elements of description how the author rides with his son and two friends through the states. But this serves only to give a frame, a context.My second was that I thought it is a philosophical piece. No, it isn't. Sure, the author deals with philosophical questions. And it is really entertaining and quite learning to experience the original notions of some concepts as intended by their inventors Plato, Socrates, and some others. Then there is this crazy idea of overcoming a perceived dichotomy between aesthetics and technics by the author. Which is interesting, but the proposed solution is quaint at best. And my personal opinion about that one is that everyone should find for himself the solution for this &quot;problem&quot;.No, what makes this book so interesting is that the author describes a transformation of himself. With words and phrases quite common to the western world. One could almost say that he conquers himself. It is believable and sometimes shocking what he reveals. It has nothing to do with Zen whatsoever. I read a bit about Zen, and to be quite frank, the idea of Zen sounds ridiculous to me. Again the title might confuse the buyer of the book. Luckily the book was recommended to me by a former teacher and when I finally got the chance to read it, I did. I read the german translation, which is quite good, albeit has some flaws. And I read this edition, which is better, because the author explains some things which might have gone unnoticed otherwise.And I'm thankful for that."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"It would indeed be a sacrilage if one goes about talking on ZAAMM without dwelling on the cover page itself...here we find the symbolic representation of the work in its entiriety...a spanner head at one end and a flower(white) at the other end &gt; the spanner symbolises this era of technological and scientific advances...the rational facet of our reality!The flower at the other end represents the emotional/spiritual aspect of our reality... the combination of both makes it an interplay of polar opposites....and it is this conflict Pirsig resolves in a masterly way!...It is indeed possible to be scientific and at the same time spiritual...and this is the way to evolve at the inner level in this age of paradigm shifts! Though Pirsig starts with the description of a cross country bike ride with his curious son.. the journey soon becomes an amazing spiritual odyssey of a man in search of himself.. the route maps without charts the pathways within..the very motorcycle becomes the extention of the rider...and here the inanimate assumes the soulfulness of Life itself!...I'm just reminded of a brilliant short story &quot;Inside and Outside&quot; by Hermman Hesse that gives immense insight into the sprit lurking within ZAAMM! Surely, Pirsig talks much like our fellow pilgrim on our journey towards light...the inner light...call it &quot;QUALITY&quot; or &quot;SELF&quot;...his gleamings from the way side becomes our lamp posts ..and soon we realize that the path we tread outside is the very path we closed within...and the musings of this maverick mystic knocks that door open...!

With only one exception I have never been more pleased with a book. As I made my way through the well crafted prose, and beautiful philosophy I began to act quite differently. Not noticable to me, but people started commenting that I was more layed back, and seemed to be looking at life with a new perspective. I've studied far eastern religions for the past 3 years, and no books has made me realize what they are all about the way ZMM did. I really can't recommend this book enough, but the best way that I can put it is that the day when I read the last page, I flipped right back to the front and started again."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"I first encountered this book in 1975 as my father was reading it, as we were (unknown to the rest of the family) retracing the journey of the unnamed narrator and Chris through the Dakotas, Montana, and on into the west.He gave me the book as I started college that year, and I read it through my first semester -- a few pages here and there. Read it while walking to the train station, read it while working on campus. I enjoyed it somewhat up until the middle, when it really caught fire for me. The second half is just fabulous.There are great little bits in the book that I've reflected upon often. The degrees-and-grading, the gumptionology, the geometry, the intro-to-philosophy. The bit about having a creative block because the topic is too big. These are all little vignettes woven very nicely into a compelling book. I loved it.I lent out my copy many times over the next twenty years...always making sure I got it back. My dad asked for it back last year, and of course I gave it to him...cover shredded, pages marked up by a dozen readers, yellowed and old -- but still as vibrant as when it was written.When I've heard and read what's happened later in Pirsig's life, the book becomes tragic, but that's not really here nor there. It stands on its own."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"I've had to buy 3 copies of this book. The first two were loaned to friends who never returned them. Yes, it's a great book. It's not about Zen or motorcycles. It is about quality, values, and relationships.I first read ZMM 18 years ago, at age 17. Since then, I've been impressed by 3 things about the book: 1)It's one of those books that you can pick up after not touching for 5 years, and end up spending hours rereading sections on a rainy afternoon. 2) It's one of those books that when you meet someone who also read &amp; loved it, and then discuss it with them, it always seems that they got something different out of it than you did. 3) You can pick it up after not reading it for 10 years, re-read it, and it's as though you've just read a completely different book.Many reviewers here have stated that reading the book changed their lives. I read it at a pretty impressionable time, so I can't say as how my life would've been different if I hadn't read it. I do believe though that reading the book did teach me at least one absolute truth: There are two types of people in the world- people who love ZMM, and people who &quot;just don't get it&quot;.

This is one of those books that you either get or you don't. It is all about timing. When it was my time, I stopped doing everything else to read it. I was in the throes of a major mental meltdown. The world I was physically living in was not the world I was living inside of my head. The separation had become almost unbearable.If you are a thinker, analyzing everything (and I mean everything) and have reached the point that you are not sure you can think any deeper and that the rest of the world around you seems far away, this is your book.If you are peeling away the onion layers of the mystery of life from a purely intellectual standpoint and you have realized that it can be infinitely sliced and you are questioning your sanity compared to those around you, this is the book for you.Sure the author is relatively depressed and the tone is not overly buoyant, but this book will take you on the ride of your life. It will take you to the edge but it will not take you over the edge. You will come back and you will come back feeling relieved. You are not alone; there are millions out there who feel the same way.Or this book may save your life.

They may very well be telling the truth, but I know far more people that put this book down in frustration than in rapture. Pirsig indeed captures a subtle, yet vital, way to engage reality in a mechanized and secular late 20th century. This book certainly must be credited for inspiring so much of the New Age literary spiritualism that followed it. But this book is not for everyone. Heavy doses of Kant and sweeping passages of rural landscapes have caused many a person to put it down thinking they've grasped the general idea, which is enough to discuss it at the next social gathering. This book, however, is a journey of the mind and the self at a particular moment in time. It is also a touching, and sometimes wrenching, acount of a man's own life. Pirsig's view of integrating technology into one's spiritual perspective is actually more interesting now than when he wrote it. It offers an immense amount to a prepared reader. But don't expect it to be an easy book offering any answers. It is a beautiful, though trying, process. If it doesn't grab you right away, don't be afraid to put it down for a few months. When the time is right, this book can be a centering experience."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"As Prisig himself says, &quot;the real cycle you're working on is a cycle called 'yourself'.&quot;, &quot;Astronomers would be telling mankind that if it looked long enough through a telescope powerful enough, what it would see was the back of it's own head.&quot; I feel like I'm back in school and have just finished a very intensive philosophy class, but theres no grade, no pass or fail, and the University is in your mind. If I've learned anything from this book it is that &quot;Quility&quot; is &quot;Reality&quot;. &quot;'Quality' is the parent, the source of all subjects and objects. &quot;Any intellectually conceived object is always in the past and therefore unreal. Reality is always the moment of vision before the intellectualization takes place. There is no other reality.&quot; &quot;Religion isn't invented by man. Men are invented by religion.

Let me explain: I read &quot;Zen...&quot; when I was 22. It was time in my life when I needed new ideas, even a new way of thinking, if you like. And that is what I loved about this book. For me, it is the story of someone brave enough to follow their own thoughts and actually do something NEW! It contains what, for me, was a wealth of new ideas and the connection of many thoughts I had already had into a broader, deeper picture. Ideas old, new, Eastern and Western all find there place here.Before reading this, my impression of philosophy was a lot of old men arguing about the exact definitions of words. After reading, I became aware of what philosophy should be - the quest to advance human knowledge! For me, this book manages to impart some of the great excitement and adventure of this quest.But then there is the down side. I still believe that philosophy is strange subject, that to study it is a contradiction in terms. Someone who is involved in the discovery of new ideas is what I would call a 'philosopher', rather than those who generally go by that name.But this is not a philosophy text book. The conclusions drawn are probably not very profound or useful for developing a better world. But it is a very good read, on several levels, and very well written. I found it inspiring and thought provoking, even if you do not necessarily agree with the conclusions. This is where I am being subjective. I just found it so exciting that there are people out there chasing new ideas and challenging old ones, that the actual central argument of the book, on the role of quality in life, seemed almost secondary.Still, it has been three years since the first reading. I feel this review has not, and indeed could not express the profound effect this book had on me at the time.

I had to read it 3 times. The first time was for the story of him and his son, the second as a philosophy primer and the third as a metaphysics. It was the first time that I ever read a book and really believed that the author just wanted me to think about what he was writing and not AGREE with what he was writing. I was allowed to think for myself, encouraged to think for myself as I read. It is the single most important book I have ever read in regards to my career as a teacher, and the messages about how we think and the way we perceive and learn are, I feel, so important that my classes need to see them and not just hear me talk about it.

Some of it is true, some of it is plauseable, but for the most part it just rambles.

This book has so much to offer, but you need to want to listen. This is a book for one who is disillusioned with themselves and everything this ****ed up world appears to offer. It reveals your own inadequacies with such a caring hand because the author knows them in himself. Reading this book, I found someone talking about their own pain. This isn't a book aimed at healing the world. It's a book about stopping and looking at yourself and all the clasifications you make of other people and how quickly we blow off people when we really should be (and in actuality are) blowing ourselves. At the right time it's just a book that makes you realise you're not alone but you are stupid.

It really makes you think, but somehow it doesn't make life any clearer- it only succeeded i confirming the fact that I have NO clue about life whatsoever!

She liked this bookand read it repeatedly.Reading this story and finding that thetwenty-fifth anniversary edition of this book was published inpaperback, I bought a copy and began to read it by expecting to learnsomething about philosophy or the history of philosophy. To someextent, this expectation made me read the book quickly in an effort toget to possible chapters where the teaching of philosophy might befully given. Even without such a motivation, however, one could readthis book speedily, because the story magically enchants the readerand because the style of Pirsig's writing is very readable even to thenon-native speaker of English who, like me, has read only a smallnumber of novels in English.Surely, descriptions of classicalphilosophies and contemporary philosophical problems are given inparallel with the story of motorcycle traveling, I have found thatthis is essentially a novel, which invokes ideas about thereunification of art and technology and about the quality of life. Thegreat point of the book is that it can also be enjoyed as a bookon philosophy, though descriptions of ancient Greek philosophies inlater chapters are not very understandable.

It scores high on both counts.Phaedrus, our narrator, takes a present-tense cross-country motorcycle trip with his son during which the maintenance of the motorcycle becomes an illustration of how we can unify the cold, rational realm of technology with the warm, imaginative realm of artistry. As in Zen, the trick is to become one with the activity, to engage in it fully, to see and appreciate all details--be it hiking in the woods, penning an essay, or tightening the chain on a motorcycle.In his autobiographical first novel, Pirsig wrestles both with the ghost of his past and with the most important philosophical questions of the 20th century--why has technology alienated us from our world? what are the limits of rational analysis? if we can't define the good, how can we live it? Unfortunately, while exploring the defects of our philosophical heritage from Socrates and the Sophists to Hume and Kant, Pirsig inexplicably stops at the middle of the 19th century. With the exception of Poincar&eacute;, he ignores the more recent philosophers who have tackled his most urgent questions, thinkers such as Peirce, Nietzsche (to whom Phaedrus bears a passing resemblance), Heidegger, Whitehead, Dewey, Sartre, Wittgenstein, and Kuhn.In the end, the narrator's claims to originality turn out to be overstated, his reasoning questionable, and his understanding of the history of Western thought sketchy. His solution to a synthesis of the rational and creative by elevating Quality to a metaphysical level simply repeats the mistakes of the premodern philosophers. But in contrast to most other philosophers, Pirsig writes a compelling story. And he is a true innovator in his attempt to popularize a reconciliation of Eastern mindfulness and nonrationalism with Western subject/object dualism. The magic of Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance turns out to lie not in the answers it gives, but in the questions it raises and the way it raises them. Like a cross between The Razor's Edge and Sophie's World, Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance takes us into \\"the high country of the mind\\" and opens our eyes to vistas of possibility."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"After all these years as an active reader, I still consider Robert Pirsig's incredible tour-de-force in this book to be the intellectual adventure of a lifetime, one that still makes me shake my head in wonder after a number of readings of it. I was introduced to &quot;Zen&quot; by my brother in law, who promised me that I would enjoy it. Wow, what an understatement! By now I must admit to now having several short quotes from it framed under glass at various spots in the house, because I was so taken by the gravity of what he has to say, and the disarmingly simple way he usually chooses to say it. Pirsig is a man with a lot to say, and a lot of wisdom in what he has to offer.Although I must admit that I do not agree with certain key aspects of his argument regarding the way the ancient bifurcation between what he calls romantic and classic perceptive orientations can at last be repaired and restored to cognitive and intellectual unity, I stand in utter awe at the quality of mind any human being must have to marshal such a breath-taking effort as this, at the accomplishment of conceiving and articulating the philosophical treatise described in such loving and painstaking detail here. His grasp of such eclectic, obscure and philosophically central notions truly is a feat quite the equal of the ascent of Everest in terms of the levels of concentration, mental endurance, and simple cognitive acumen necessary to muster this kind of argument.The book works on two levels that both assist and complement each other. First, the story narrative, which he uses both to illustrate ideas he is talking about and to introduce ideas he wants to discuss, also acts to bring us back to &quot;normal everyday reality' after spinning high in the thin cold air of his theorizing. Second, the philosophical story becomes a kind of sophisticated detective story for curious intellectuals, as Pirsig's alter ego, Phaedrus, searches deeper and deeper into the mysteries that once led him into insanity because of the sheer intensity of his efforts to solve the riddle of the difference between the two seemingly irreconcilable aspects of reality (the romantic and the classic).The book is an awe-inspiring trip into a discovery of the nature of reality, contemporary society, and yourself. It has led to study groups, study guides, and a whole cult of Pirsig watchers who consider him the functional equivalent of the wise seer. The wildly best-selling book also led Pirsig deeper into a life of isolation, eschewing publicity and seeking greater introspection. There is a sequel, called &quot;Lila&quot;, which also enjoyed a best-selling run on the charts in the early 1990s. This is a book that is quite unlike anything else you have ever read, and is something you have to experience to understand in its full impact. It is also a book I can recommend with a smile, knowing with confidence you will be glad you finally decided to buy it and read it. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"After reading about 1/2 of the 170+ comments on this book i see two types, those who soaked in Pirsig's point of view, and those who read it specifically for the philosophical (or is it psychological) worth. The former were tromendously satisfied and the latter were not so.After reading the book two and a half times (first as required reading in a Psychology course) i felt it necissary to expound my views on it. The first time through i was reading for content and answers for quiz material - i truly missed the spirit of the book, the underlying truth that was presented by a confused and enlightened man. Once the pressure was over, i read it as Phaedrus would have - line by line. I started mulling over the unknowns and unanswerables that were presented and i found that the voice of the book was the voice of my proverbial soul - i had believed what the book presented before i read it which is just as confusing and bewildering as my mind and the world. It made me understand that truth is not always rational, what is rational is not always right, and what is right not always the truth.The crux, I believe, is that this book is meant for those who are seeking something more, and those who are forced into reading it, or read it merely because it was suggested will not truly get out of it what is intended - a bit of enlightenment that proves how unenlightened our world and ourselves are."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"I first read ZAMM as a sociology class assignment in 1979. I hated it! I wondered why a sociology professor would want us to read this book. I bought the book second-hand, paying $.95 for it. What a DEAL! I still have it, full of my notes from my first reading.In 1987, an interest in Zen caused me to pull the book off the shelf and reread it. I discovered something the second time around...this is a GREAT BOOK.The relationship between the narrator and his son Chris evolves into something wonderful. The author's search for his former identity (pre electro-convulsive shock treatment) is a mystery tale unfolding. And the quest for the meaning of Quality hits home for me in my search for that inner peace that comes from &quot;caring.&quot;You've got to care. Quality is about caring.You can see it at the supermarket when a checker really &quot;cares.&quot; Most of the time, however, you see the uncaring. Ask the checker how he/she is doing, the answer you get is likely, &quot;I'll be doing great when I get off.&quot; There's no heart...there's no caring. And so, Quality of service suffers.ZAMM gives timeless tips on how to get the &quot;caring&quot; back into the things you do. My life has been greatly changed by following some of the tips. It became evident in a statement that came to mind a few months ago... &quot;Work is a state of mind we engage in when we feel we have no other choice.&quot; We always have a choice. It's only work if you don't enjoy what you're doing. The choice is clear...either change what you're doing, or change how you feel about what you're doing.Peace of mind comes with caring about what you're doing. All &quot;work&quot;, every job, in some way or fashion, makes the world a better place. Find meaning in that. Find out how what you do makes the world a better place, and dwell on that contribution, rather than the short-term goal of getting off work.By the way, I'm on my 12th rereading of ZAMM. And every time I read it, I gain some new little insight.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"Don't let the title of this review fool you, I really did like the book. I quite enjoyed looking through the many layers (some obvious, others subtle) and I'm quite sure that I'll catch more when I read this book again. One does not need to know anything at all about Greek, Eastern or Modern philosophy to read this book, although the more one already knows, the more one will get out of it.Personally, I felt that the meditations on the role of Quality in reality started off very well. This was a very good attempt at merging the Eastern and Western (or &quot;classical vs romantic&quot; as they are also stated in the book) modes of thinking into a single coherent thought. Unfortunately, I felt that it fell slightly short of its goal. Pirsig's world view would seem to add an unlimited amount of inherent facts to every object that exists. Quality doesn't seem to me to have a single value for all things. For example, a screwdriver would be seen to have very good Screw-Turning Quality, but would have very low Beer-Can-Opening Quality. For every possible method, there would be a different Quality rating. Instead of Pirsig's single combination between one subject and one object, you have all sorts of relations between an object and every possible subject.Although I felt the reasoning didn't quite hold up, I found the train of thought to be an utterly fascinating one. I very much like the idea of Quality being the relation of a mind with an object. If nothing else, the book opens up a lot of room for meditation on the subject. It's an interesting seed that leads the mind into all sort of passages of reason. Even if you don't agree with his conclusions, it's a great place to start letting your brain flow.The conventional story of the motorcyclist and his son, told in between the meditating, is rather enjoyable as well. Pirsig's description of the open road is quite appealing and I found myself wanting to take a few months off and ride out into the sunset! The passages describing the feel of the road and the differences between seeing something from inside a car versus seeing it from a motorcycle are quite good and although I've never been near a motorbike in my life, I began to understand the desire for the wide open spaces that he has.The bottom line is that this is a very good book for anyone interested in philosophy, motorcycles or just well-written stories."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"I've procrastinated for months before writing this review because I was afraid of doing the book a disservice. But....the time has come :-)I love this book - for its excellent handling of an oblique subject, and for giving us a message for the times.In Pirsig's words, ZATAOMM has acquired \\"kulturbearer\\" status - i.e., it encompasses entire realms of thought within our present culture, and it attempts to carry these things into cultures of the future.It talks about the split between Art and Technology and the unease of regarding one from the other standpoint. It discourses about the innermost mechanisms that make \\"Hip\\" and \\"Square\\" two distinct schools, and how they actually represent two different worldviews. But Pirsig is about unifying, not dividing. He delineates the divisions, only to unify them later.The book seeks to create a framework (of thought) from which such concepts - Art/Technology, Hip/Square , Groovy/Classical - need no longer be treated as disparate entities. This is an ambitious work all right. Pirsig points you to subtle concepts - he needs to uncover the very nature of our natures before he can show you what's wrong with it. To do this, Pirsig deconstructs Perception to study why we believe what we believe - this involves discourses on Myth and Legend (my other hero, Joseph Campbell came to mind a lot in these passages).He goes back in history to the ancient Greek schools - Stoics, Aristotle, and the beginnings of Dialectic and Rhetoric. The last part of the book is pure detective work, where he uses thought structures as clues and tracks down the perpetrator of the crime; the crime being the modern disconnect between Form and Function, and the perpetrator being the person who dominated early Western thought and created the philosophical foundations of the Modern Western Industralised World. I won't reveal this villain here - go read the book.Pirsig opines that humans took a wrong turn at that point in history, and grew into a race of beings that only recognised Good-Bad, Right-Wrong, Theory-Proof, i.e. a \\"Dialectic Approach\\" ; Pirsig blames this worldview for many modern evils.Pirsig claims to have studied Eastern philosophy - spent time in Benares, India and so forth. But his deconstruction is mainly relevant to Western thought, or Dialectic Reality. Some of his conclusions are indeed mirrored in Vedantic teachings. But, this reworking for a modern audience is worth its weight in gold.The practical relevance of this philosophical tour-de-force is the message of Quality, its relation to happiness, and how to achieve it. Pirsig's Quality is not the ubiquitous quality - it is far more involved but very simple when you understand it. The book's final assertion is \\"From Caring comes Quality, from which comes happiness\\". \\"Gumption\\" is noted as something that will help achieve Quality, and Pirsig uses motorcycle maintenance as an illustration.Although the subject is so arcane, it is very interestingly rendered. The philosophical plot is masterfully interwoven with the mundane plot with descriptions of life on the road and with friends, and with his son, which are all relevant to the philosophy that follows it. And, there's also a dramatic twist in the story regarding the main characters in the book - i.e., Pirsig and his son, which really elevates the book.For all the heavy language and unintentional high-brow, this is a very humanistic work with a timeless message. This book will cease to be important the day happiness goes out of fashion. Go for it!"},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"I think that the popularity of Zen & the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance is largely to do with the catchy title. It seems to promise a light-hearted investigation of Eastern philosophy with helpful illustrations from the point of view of a motorcyclist. What Pirsig actually provides is a combination of his investigation of the roots of Western philosophy and a narrative that converges on two tracks - a cross-country ride with his son and the spectacular destruction of his intellectually obsessive personality. What he emerges with is the concept/experience of 'Quality', which, though he refuses to define it rigorously, seems to be a pre-analytical experience of the world 'as it is', a cure for diseased rationality.The strength of the book is the narrative, especially that of 'Phaedrus', Pirsig in his pre-breakdown life when he relentlessly pursued Truth in science and philosophy. Phaedrus seemed to me to be looking for something genuine, even if he did it in unhealthy ways and with a monstrous ego. The motorcyclist is less interesting, a kind of faded 70s hippie who struggles to relate to his son and is disdainful of pretty much everyone who does not share his view of life.The philosophy is fairly unimpressive, which probably accounts for its lack of influence more than the conspiracy theory that Pirsig wants to weave. While he has insight into philosophical problems, his scholarship seems quite limited and therefore his claim to have overcome the weaknesses of all Western philosophy seems a bit rich. His ideas are not really that new. For instance, Heidegger investigated Being from the point of view of the subject with a lot more insight and profundity than is on display here.Overall, not a bad introduction to a number of philosophical issues, and an interesting portrayal of intellectual obsession. The sections where he actually does speak about motorcycle maintenance are the ones that stayed in my mind and do open up helpful ways of approaching the problems of daily life. More of this would have made this a genuine classic."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"Dear All,As is always helpful I have read the book a couple of times now. I have also read the highly mixed reviews varying from coffee-shop boredom and a philosophy teachers irritation to some people who have genuinely loved this book. I must say that I can sympathise in part with both views. Indeed, if you have already formed some views on philosophy (and you may not be aware that you have) then be prepared, for you may be in for a few irritating moments. However, as is demonstrated by so many who have read and reviewed this book it has been a source of immense enjoyment and for many it seems to have changed their lives for the better. I am not going to bore anyone with the rigours of whether his philosophy is consistent or not but I will say that I am glad that he offers some healthy scepticism to many of todays accepted views.If you want philosophy, do read the book but remember that many of the views are contentious. In other words read with your eyes open and make your own minds up. As some of the less than happy readers have pointed out, there are many good books on philosophy so don't forget about those.As for whether you will be bored or not I think that it is quite clear from the reviews, varying from 5 star to 1 star, that you will just have to read it to find out. I hope you do not find the experience to be a waste."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"althought I am enjoying the book, the pages have been cut poorly and unevenly, 5 out of every 20 pages are torn as opposed to cut, giving the book a half assed shabby appearance."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"Actually I never received this book. I need to follow up with Amazon to see why. This is a big thumbs down for Amazon."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"A philosophy textbook hidden by a disquise of a motorcycle maintenance manual. I know nothing of motorcycle maintenance but I thought that this would be an interesting way to learn a little about it and how that simple act could relate to my life. I was quite wrong. Pirsig does discuss the various fixes he uses on his bike along his journey. Don't get fooled. He uses these side trips only to advance his main topic of philosphic confusion and insanity. If you are a student of philosphy or quality then by all means enjoy, but all others steer clear."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"I had been interested in this book since the 'eighties, largely because of its title and the fact that I have a strong interest in philosophy and have been a motorcycle rider for over forty years. I ordered it for my Kindle and slogged through about 60 percent of it, but I'm sorry - I can't take any more. Clearly, either this guy has some serious real psychiatric illness or is jerking all our chains for a profit. In either way, I'm out of here. This is only one of two books in my entire life I have abandoned before finishing it. Dense philosophy is one thing, but this is fraud. God help those of you who try to see it through to the end."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"I understand that the whole idea of this book is to make the reader think for himself about 'quality', which is a very interesting philisophical concept...this is presumably why Pirsig makes time for the reader to think about it by making 90% of the book as boring as possible. This book falls between reference, fiction and biography and satisfies none of these forms. It's quite amazing how by using the right words Pirsig can make a simple theory seem extremely complicated."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"He is insane, and in fact, receives electroshock treatments for his illness. Being forced to receive the treatments renders him powerfully resentful, and his entire book is an attempt to say he wasn't sick. This mess of a book should convince you he was sick."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"Pirsig leads us on hundreds of pages in a self-indulgent quest for the definition of \\"quality,\\" in an East meets West context. Note to author: Webster defines quality in many ways. Among them are 1.) Character (as in attribute) 2.) Comparative rank (for the relativists out there) 3.) Superior rank (as a contrast to #2). It's really that simple, Mr. Pirsig. Get over it.Oh, and by the way, next time you criticize the \\"Church of Reason,\\" be aware that your rhetoric is actually a reasoned argument against reason. This alone should be \\"reason\\" enough to avoid your convoluted ideology."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"My dad encouraged me to read this book, and he had a free copy so I thought what the hell. I had a job at a coffee shop at the time and during down time I would read a few pages. Man, everyone has heard of this book. You don't know how many people came into the store and saw it sitting there and mentioned what a great book it was, I asked everyone of them if they personally read it and I can remember them all saying &quot;Uh, well I heard it was good from a friend&quot;. Anyway, save your hard earned cash and buy a motorcycle manual or something this is the most boring book I've ever read. There's not a hint of inspired writing or insight here, then again I should have known better my dad reads books on playing chess."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"i would not recommend anyone to read this book based on the following quote in it. \\"When one person suffers from a delusion, it is called insanity. When many people suffer from a delusion it is called a Religion.\\" with this one statement, he relegates whatever religion anyone has to the waste bin. to give any time to a person with such a disrespect to what to a lot of people is the most important thing in their lives makes no sense. yes, those of a certain religion will say that another religion is wrong, and this is how it should be; otherwise all religions are the same, which is not true. However, despite this disagreement between differing religions, the author's statement is blasphemous toward them all. it's supposed to be a smart, pithy, humorous comment, designed to make people think, by using some shock. all it is is a disrespect to the general populace, a lack of gratitude for the good things that religion does bring, and a demonization of the most profound subject matter of the great majority of sentient beings."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"Yeah: it all makes sense when you get to the part about the author getting shock treatments."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"I just got this book, because it is one of the favorites of the Lakers coach Phil Jackson.

I'm not sure whether I'm an exception to the rule or somehow just in both camps at once. There were some parts of this book which I found fascinating and wonderful. There were other parts which I found interminable and uninspiring.Am I sorry I read the book? No, I think that in sum it was a worthwhile experience. Would I rush to read it again? No, I wouldn't, and I would offer only a qualified recommendation to anyone who asked if they should read this book. I would tell them that if they were willing to be patient and were willing to allot a significant chunk of time to the book then they would almost certainly get something out of it and they would have enhanced, in some small way, their general cultural literacy."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"If your looking for a book that talks about philosophy, this is it, even though it is sometimes incredibly hard to make sense of it. This is truly a book that will force you to think. One must figure out what Pirsig is trying to say through pages upon pages of rambling about the meaning of things such as quality. This is a book to STAY AWAY from if you are looking for a good read.The book starts as a seemingly interesting story about a boy and his father on a motorcycle trip; however, as the book goes on, more and more of Phaedrus, Pirsig's other personality, comes back. The further one reads, the more complex and impossible to understand it becomes. At points, I was just praying for Pirsig to go back to talking about the motorcycle trip, yet as the end neared, I became very interested in what was going to happen, and I must say, I was not let down."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"This is probably one of my favorite books. An autobiographical cross country journey with philosophical insights thrown in. I was skeptical at first, but after receiving this book as a gift, I was hooked. I've hooked other friends as well. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"After reading this novel I found myself intrigued by the way that Pirsig thinks and expresses his thoughts through the main character. I also found it very interesting that he was able to tie together three seemingly different stories to creat a wonderful book. The only negative thing that I have to say about this book is that it was very difficult to grasp some of the concepts that he introduced and I had to re-read some of the pages several times before I understood what he was saying. Other than that I found it to be one of the best books I've ever read."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"This book can be read as a novel about a cross-country journey a man takes with his son.And it can be read as a book about Zen, and Art, and Motorcycle Maintenance, and how, if you begin with the right mental approach, these three seemingly disparate things really aren't different at all.And it can be read as a guide to how to live your life better, giving meaning to otherwise mundane daily tasks.And, when combined with it's sequel, &quot;Lila&quot;, it can be read as (arguably) the deepest and greatest philosophical work the 20th century produced, laying the groundwork for a whole new Metaphysics and fundamentally altering our view of reality.But no matter how the book is read, there's no denying that it is a work of astoundingly high Quality."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"This is undoubtedly one of the best books availablefor the reader who is seeking to broaden theirunderstanding of basic philosophical issues. Pirsigis very clever at weaving in and out of complexinvestigations into the basic assumptions which tiedown and restrict our thought processes. He does thisby means of a compelling storyline and an accessiblewriting style. I read this book in my junior year incollege and it was provided me with more insight tothe foundational questions upon which many belief systemsare based then any other book which I read during college.Pick it up. This book is for the type of person who enjoysan intellectual challenge."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"I've had a copy of this book for 10 years, and in that time I've read it 4 times. Each time I reread it, I find new things which impress. Just leaving aside the central Metaphysics-of-Quality for a moment, its actually a well written story. The author illustrates his knowledge of language through descriptions of the origins of words, and he puts this knowledge to good use. He seems to have put considerable effort into using the correct words throughout - only the use of 'square' grates nowadays.The other (for me) great thing now is the ironic humour which is especially visible in part 3. For example, there;s the part where the author's son is having a severe emotional crisis in a restaurant, they get up to leave, and the waitress says:&quot; I'm sorry your boy's not feeling good. &quot; Well if you're familiar with the book, this is so full of irony it can make you laugh out loud.It just leads me to think this guy is *even* cleverer each time you read it."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"This is what a book is supposed to be.

It was also extremely repetitive and Pirsig takes forever to get simple points across to the reader."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"ZTAMM was assigned for a graduate level health class because the psychology prof had fallen under its spell in 1974. That was my first exposure to its apparent paradox. Now I am in my turn assigning the book to my classes in diversity. The description of Pirsig's descent into mental illness is what I want my class to get from it. So few people are able to describe how the mentally ill may view the world that the few descriptions that exist offer a valuable tool to those of us who work with mentally ill on a daily basis. As R.D. Laing pointed out, to understand the &quot;journey&quot; a person takes into mental illness is not to become lost in their construction of reality but to develop a greater empathy for them and their families. .

Personally, I find that any book worth reading will change my life. This one didn't.Zen and the Art of Lacklustre Hippiedom has all the philosophical insight of Sophie's World, and all the entertainment value of the Boston Telephone Directory.

It touches ideas from many other philosophies, such as the Greek and Hindu, but none of these thoughts tie together very well. The author seems to be getting into touch with something but then it all becomes incoherent after a point, and fades away.One of the advantages of reading this book is the knowledge that one would gain about the relationships of various philosophers such as Plato, Socrates and Aristotle.But if you are looking for a REAL philosophy, this book will not take you very far. The idea of quality transcending subject and object is a very generic idea present in other philosophies. The Gita presents this idea most beautifully, building it upon the Veda and Sankhya philosophies."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"The narrator used to be a different person he refers to as Phaedrus. The reader gets the idea that the narrator had been through the rigors of a mental hospital until he stopped being Phaedrus. Phaedrus was a Professor of Rhetoric, but couldn't stand his Epiphanies. Now in the present time of the story the narrator is on a voyage across America with his eleven year old son on the back of his motorcycle and, riding along with them are a middle-class, unaware couple who are friends but who don't really know the narrator or his son very well. They are riding their motorcycle, but know nothing about how to take care of one. The narrator knows everything about motorcycle maintenance and uses this subject as the basis for his philosophy. The narrator carries off the traditional role of &quot;father knows best&quot; to his son. He is rude and peremptory towards the boy. This personality clashes with the rest of his image as &quot;wise philosopher.&quot; There is unending common sense philosophy and logic presented and the narrative is written around it. One thought that I found interesting was that the scholars of the medieval world taught that Earth is a flat platform. If one walks too close to the edge, one might fall off and be lost forever in the outer darkness. The people at that time were terrified of this possibility. But today, we are taught that Reason is the platform on which we live. If we move too close to the edge of Reason, we might fall off and be lost to forever to insanity. This is what now terrifies people.It is an interesting book, but its seventies outlook comes through."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"I read this book many years ago, while still in my teens. It had a profound impact on me. I don't think this is for the serious philosophy student. But I do recommend it as a starter title in the area."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"There are many devotees to this book and I consider it a must read. Some of my friends regard Pirsig's work as a bit too wacky, but I found it to be enjoyable.

I had never heard of it before and thought that the title was worth the price of admission. It was, and then some. I still have this book and even have some passages underlined. Since I first read this book, I have heard alot more about it. Other reviewers have knocked Pirsig for lack of originality even though he states from the beginning that nothing in the book is original, just loosely organized into one volume. He has also been hit for presentation. The thing to remember is that this book was not written for intellectuals at a university. It was written for common people living common lives. And yes, you will benifit from the advice in this book. When I read it, I was working on weapons/cargo elvators in the Navy. after reading this and trying to impliment some of the ideas in this book, I found my attitude and my work perfomance improve. The proof is in the pudding kids. And for me anyway, this book helped me start to live my life rather than just go through the dull motions every day."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"I am 19 and attend a major university where I drink and sleep in through all the morning hours.

As a teacher, I find its message the most valuable I've ever encountered. As a father, I find its message the most powerful account I've read. This book, as well as Lila, really do have the answers for those of us searching. I enjoyed the added comments from Pirsig for the 25th anniversary."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"An excellent dig into the philosophy of philosophy. Zen has a great discussion of a man in search of the qualities of life, both classic and romantic."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"The fact that more than 120 people have spent their time sitting at their computers and reviewing the 'good' and 'bad' of Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance not only proves that the book's philosophical meandering about &quot;Quality&quot; - which eventually leads to several different points about the essence of experience and life itself is fairly right-on, but that, as in the book itself, Quality is dictated (when intellectually reviewed) by a person's background and preconceptions. This unique viewpoint as well as the grace with which it is reached (motorcycle trips, mountain hikes...et cetera) is enough to make it a worthwhile and brilliant read."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"This book is definitely one of the most interesting I have ever read. It expands on many ideas and unifies areas (Religion, Art, and Science) that aren't commonly thought of as connected. Pirsig's talent and intelligence are quite amazing. These are definitely some important ideas. I highly recommend it! Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"First off, if you enjoy philosophy and introspective writing you will find this book difficult to put down as that is entirely what it is. Now, if you need dead bodies, alien invasions, or journeys to retrieve the holy grail then you will not enjoy this book.Prisig's story is interesting and his quirky personal insights and observations are what keep the book moving. Much of the material about the motorcycle trip I found quite boring and unrelated to his internal journey.Prisig's genuine interest in philosophy is evident in his content and is readily digested because of his economical use of language. There is no verbose pretentious grand standing in his writing.I really was interested in the gradual revelations about his life and his relationships with his friends past and present. Don't expect to find any answers here, just enjoy the ride."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"I have never taken a philosophy course, so I will admit that having taken one might have better prepared me for this journey. It starts out very intriguing--both the physical motorcycle journey, and the narrarator's discussion of technology and art. Then, when we get up into &quot;high country,&quot; I found myself completely lost. I have a bachelor's degree in English, so I think of myself as fairly intelligent. But perhaps it is like his analogy to reading Walden: you have to pause after every sentence and let it set in. It's just that if I did that, it would take me years to get through this book. Some wonderful ideas, but this book is definitely not light reading."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"This book is widely read among people involved with higher education. When you read the book, it becomes obvious why. Although it doesn't teach much about motorcycles, it doesn't give us a general idea of how we could live our life.As near as I am able to determine it has three basic plots. The first and most usual is a father and a son going on a motorcycle trip through the northwestern states. They ride the motorcycle through the country on a long trip back to their old home and anywhere else they feel like visiting. Second is the father trying to find a piece of his personality that he lost as a ward of the state. His previous self had been a collage Rhetoric teacher at some school in Montana. He lost it in a very interesting way. The third and most time and space consuming plot isn't really a plot but more like a discourse on modern life.Should you venture to read this book don't do it for the first plot or the second plot. They take up only a very small portion of the book, like say, two paragraphs every chapter. The big reason to read it would be for the ideas and thoughts of an insane or maybe genius collage professor trying to get the world to make sense to himself. If you're looking for action look somewhere else.The reason I liked this book had to do with the ideas. In every chapter he would say something that would make sense and be worth writing a book about in and of itself. He did; however, have one great though that cost him a personality. Now the main idea in as little space as I can manage and still have it make sense.( To me at least)It is generally believed that the world is made up of two things; subjects and objects. Objects being physical things and subjects being thoughts or Ideas. If we refine this further we get the romantic and the classical , the hip and the square, the poet and the scientist, radical and conservative, democrat and Republican. One side based on hard facts and the other on ideas and feelings. Each side has its good parts and nether one is necessarily bad. It comes to me now that before the professor lost his personality he was one and afterwards he was the other. What he came up with was a third party. He called it quality. It is some kind of force or reaction that creates the subjects and objects. It defines what they are.To understand this we must first try and define exactly what Quality is.Quality is what makes 007 better than Spongebob Squarepants (which it is by the way). Quality is why we like to eat beef instead of beans. But what is it? We like different things for different reasons. Why is a salty fry better than a salty soup? If the Quality of a fry goes up depending on how much salt is on it does that mean that if you add salt to Cheerios they will have greater Quality?\\" SOOO, Quality is different depending on what the object is. Quality is not an object or a subject, it is something else entirely.If you think about it (for a while) you can see there is some logic to it. If nothing had quality we wouldn't care what we watched on TV because all shows would be the same, none would be better than another or worse than another. You wouldn't care what food you ate as long as it gave you nutrients, we would be Borg. There would be no bad because there would be no good. And if so there could be no God. 2 Nephi 2:13If none of this make sense then try reading it again after you read the book.I can attach several interpretations to what exactly this Quality could be. Among them are free agency, the Holy Ghost, a conscious, or maybe even God. Really, it is judgement or the ability to judge. Which is comes closest to Agency I think. It kind of throws a whole new perspective on why we needed free Agency and why we couldn't live in the garden of Eden. The book give numerous examples as to how this third party can apply to every part of our life from living with technology to collage life.Between the lines of this Trinity of Object-Quality-Subject are hundreds of small pieces of other brain-blowing wisdom. He covers environmentalism, city v country living, motorcycles v car travel, and many others subjects. Most of these are deep enough that it is best to take a break so you can think about them for a while to get the full potential of the book.Going back to the Quality of the book(pardon the pun); the writing style was a little hard to follow and it will never be a great literary masterpiece in that effect. He uses abundant allusions to Classical Greek philosophers namely Plato's Discourse on Phaedrus( which is what the professor calls his lost identity) and a working knowledge of them would be useful. I say again, do not read this for action, story line, or motorcycles. It has very little in regard to these areas and if I knew anything about Zen I guess it would probably have little to do with that either. He also uses words that mean the same thing unless you define them the way he tells you to. It really has a substantial mucilaginous vocabulary throughout the work.On a final note this book is a really good one if you like that kind of thing. It has been studied by many collages including BYU. It is great if you know the Greek Ideas but is really not a \\"fun read\\" in the normal sense. You have to think about it and it may not be relaxing the way most books are supposed to be. You shouldn't read it all at once or even very much of it at a time. It is full of Ideas not all of which are necessarily true. Remember to put every thing you choose to believe to a prayerful test. In my opinion he had something worth thinking about under all that rhetoric as do most philosophers. Read the book, but only with the right state of mind and take your time."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"Robert Pirsig decided to discuss the nature of everything. In his book, Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, he talks about many things. The book is an &quot;inquiry into values, as indicated by the cover. This book does give a good in-depth look at values. I thought this was an interesting book. I found the philosophy interesting and the method in which he chose to display it somewhat entertaining.In this book a reader will find a great deal of ancient greek philosophy. If you aren't familiar with ancient greek philosophy, that is okay, because he explains it for you. In fact he explains it several times. I believe that is really the only reason that this book's rating is lower. If Pirsig were to cut back on the amount rambling and redundant topics, this book would for sure be a four or five star book.While i criticize Pirsig's way of writing, the topic of values is a tough issue to tackle. I think that Pirsig did a great job to show how he thinks of values. The relationship of Chris and Pirsig in the book gives us a way to look at two people, and how values affect them.To conclude, this book is a great book for someone who wants to think. I think that Pirsig's long speeches and thoughts in the book would make this book very difficult for a young reader. Also, the magnitude of what is being said would be hard for a younger reader to understand. This book does however have a good message about values, the trick is just getting through Pirsig's way of writing so that you can find this book. An interesting yet difficult book."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"I read this book in college and, again, after graduation. It truly changed my life. I cannot recommend this book enough. If I could give it a rating of 6 stars, I would. Pirsig's journey may remind some of A Beautiful Mind - a genius trapped within and by his own analytical mind and thoughts.For me, this book gave me permission (as if I needed any) to care, to find passion in the task at hand, and to pursue quality in all things. A wonderful and inspiring book."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"In all probability I never would have picked this book up on my own, but now that I haveI find it hard to put down. Zen and The Art of Motorcycle Maintenance was not writtento change the world; it was written by a man who learned to change himself. This bookwas also not written to be a self-help book that gives easy answers. Most of its answersaren't that easy to come by; this book has very challenging ideas and concepts that attimes take a great deal of patience and gumption to wade through. One can't pick it upexpecting a light, easy read. And as the title itself should imply, it is not for adventurebuffs, romantics, or people who need a lot of character action in their reading. It is forthose who wish to broaden their views of understanding their world. I've used quotesfrom this book on different occasions in conversation or for school reports. The thingsRobert Pirsig has to say apply to many facets of life, or rather they can apply to as many asthe reader wants them to. This book can only be read with time and an open mind. If thereader has these two qualities, I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"Whenever I look into a new book I always read the reviews. But I don't read the reviews that give a book a good standing. I like to read the ones of the people who just didn't like it for whatever reason. I find if they can give me a difinitive argument on why the book isn't worth the paper it's printed on then they most likely have taken the time to think about it. However, in this case I believe in my own mind that people miss the point of this book. Most people read this book expecting to get some deep philosophical insight or just to impress their peers. I did enjoy the fair amount of philosophical discussion that occured but the best thing that I found when I read this book was that it gave me emotional response. Sometimes I would say, &quot;I can understand exactly where Pirsig is coming from.&quot; but other times I would just totally disagree with Pirsig's approach to a situation. So in the end this book did have an impact on the way I think and act. It gave me insight into the mind of someone else."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"Who knows what good and quality is after weeks on a complex Chautauqua with Pirsig in his widely recognized creative biography, Zen and the Art of Vehicle Maintenance. This voyage into the fundamentals of classicism, romanticism, technology, anti-technology, Zen, quality, values, history, and relationships is definitely worth the experience despite times of ambiguity, brusqueness, inconsistency, and boredom. Pirsig is an intellectual man, and he provides challenges and has expectations of at least a certain mental caliber for his readers. I believe that few can truthfully claim that they completely enjoyed this book, but many of us are mature enough to understand that this book is certainly positively unique and rare to the literature genres and styles provided today. Certainly, a book as rejected by editors prior to its publishing and as ironically internationally recognized and distinguished as ZATAOVM is today should be read with careful expecations and should be respected even by those readers who do not meet the par of its depths, complexities, and intellectual curiosity (and therefore, do not like the book).Even though I had fairly enjoyed the book, I found one thing very bothersome. A major irony and drawback of this book is the central focus of relationship. Till the end of the story, Pirsig convinces the reader that the voyage is a self-exploration (finding the self) through the filtering of unconscious memories prior to the conscious memories. Phaedrus, an obsessive ghost, is in search of what is the ultimate fundamental right way of perceiving all things, how should we determine and prioritize our values, and what are the most important things in life. It is he who reveals the answers to Pirsig and us, which concludes with a transitional focus back to Pirsig's relationship with his son, Chris. Pirsig confuses the reader whether if his intention is to lecture on philosophy, connect the reader back to their old selves, or connect us back to those who can help us find ourselves. By the way, does he have any intention, emphasis, or purpose at all? Or is intentionally providing us the freedom to extract according to our own capabilities and differences?Pirsig would probably not make a good filmmaker, but he is a wise man worth at least hearing about once in this lifetime. It can be guaranteed that everyone who reads this book, whether if it is completely or half-way, will pick up not one but at least two beautiful wisdoms! But again, everything is determined by mentality (perspective). ZATAOVM is a masterpiece if you chose to see it that way, and it is trash if you chose to blind yourself that way. Pirsig does not determine that but you. You have the natural right of establishing and controlling your own reality, truth, and life purpose. You can follow the crowd amidst your eyes, or be like Phaedrus - create a third way to seeing things that are typically \\"black or white.\\""},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"Is the book worth reading? Yes. Would I have read it if not required to? No. How much did I learn? A lot. Would I recommend it? Absolutely.The book is long; there is not doubt about that. Someone asked me that if I saw Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance on the shelf, would I pick it up? No, I wouldn't pick up the book and read it. Because I was required to read it, I was forced to look beyond my pre-conceived notions to realize there are some merits to the book. The book gives insight into the values of one very confused man. The great part about it is that as he works through his past, you work through it as well. It can be frustrating to try and understand the jumbled thoughts, but read it with the realization that it all works out in the end.There is one quote in Chapter One that stuck with me throughout the book: \\"Now the stream of our common consciousness seems to be obliterating its own banks, losing its central direction and purpose, flooding the lowlands, disconnecting and isolating the highlands and to no particular purpose other than the wasteful fulfillment of its own internal momentum. Some channel deepening seems called for.\\" That is what the book is about, deepening Robert's understanding of himself and his relationship with his son. If you're open-minded enough, you can learn a little about yourself as well. Even if all I got were new ways of looking at things and gaining appreciation of different aspects of my life, it was worth it."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"So you are looking for a book on Zen philosophy?

It's a satisfying book which you won't soon forget."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"I'm compelled to write this review after browsing the others, because something has to be said about book that isn't being pointed out for someone who is interested in the book for the first time.At this point, this book can be found on the front table in your local bookstore. Other philosophy books can be found in the philosophy section either collecting dust, or being perused by someone intensely interested in philosophy who is well versed in debates that have gone on for centuries.I have listened to the author, Robert Pirsig, being interviewed, and it seems that he did, in fact, intend for this book and its premise of \\"Quality\\" to be the great, all encompassing philosophy, presented in a straightforward, readable manner. However, despite Pirsig's intention, that is not quite why this book has become so famous.This book is famous because it fills a perfect niche in that it introduces some very complicated philosophical questions in a form that the common reader will find interesting. Pirsig is attempting to create a practical philosophy and sets the book against the background of actual experience to make the questions he ponders real for the reader.With that in mind, if you are not clamoring for a debate with someone else who is knowledgable on the ins and outs of Kierkegaard and Spinoza and are simply looking for a readable book that makes a real attempt of answering the big questions in life, this book is for you.What I find interesting, and somewhat disturbing, is that many choose to deride this book because it doesn't agree with their notions of philosopy, but fail to grasp that the people who are most likely to read this book won't even be at the table to understand their objections to it unless they read it.Probably no book has ever been more successful in interesting people in philosophy in the first place. So why are people who are interested in the subject eager to send them away because it disagrees with something they read in some banal tome?Bottom line, if you ran across this book at your local bookshop or had it recommended to you by a friend, you must read it. It is an awesomely thought inspiring book and asks questions you never thought to ask or at least didn't know how to put your finger on. It's both a good novel and a great introduction to philosophy for people who have an interest in greater questions but not all the time to pursue them. I don't think you should worry about the fact that someone with a Masters Degree in Philosophy, or an equivalent knowledge, is bothered by the book. Also, I wouldn't be thrown by the title. The book isn't trying to sell you a newsletter or convert you to any church (despite the use of the phrase \\"The Church of Reason\\") and is only using a bit of Zen philosophy as a grounding for its premise.Pirsig's premise does have a tendency to never be overtly stated, but I believe that he does this because he doesn't want it overly simplified in the way I'm about to do it.Pirsig's premise is that we live in a world of both the \\"Classical\\" and \\"Romantic\\" or, as I'll simplify it, \\"function\\" and \\"form\\", respectively. Pirsig sees the problems in our world as the result of an overemphasis on form, when function is more essential. However, pure \\"function\\" has problems of its own. For example, our bodily organs carry out the function of allowing us to live, but one doesn't really desire for our skin to be translucent so we can watch these functions. In fact, we would have a revulsion to such a thing. Therefore, we have a combination of both of \\"form\\" and \\"function\\"; our organs work very well without our having to see them. This is the desirable state. This desirable state is called \\"Quality\\". Good \\"function\\" seems to bring about its own desirable \\"form\\". May the decorative towel be damned. That's grossly oversimplified, but there it is.Finally, one shouldn't be thrown off Pirsig's premise by the fact that, quite frankly, he tends to be an impatient father and not very easy to get along with. While reading the book, it becomes apparent that Pirsig is sharing this with us because he is oblivious to it himself. He makes it obvious that he doesn't understand why no one is pondering the philosophical implications of repairing a motorcycle or why his young son isn't arriving at all of the conclusions he is, despite the fact his son is eleven. He seems to be trapped in the context of his own view of the world.So, if you want to wade your way through all of the pontificating, please take the time to read \\"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance\\". If you really, really like it, you'll have to read Pirsig's other book \\"Lila: An Inquiry Into Morals\\". Though \\"Lila\\" takes a narrative approach that's a bit less readable than \\"Zen and...\\", it gives a more comprehensive view of Pirsig's philosophy. Read both. Then you can debate with the philosophy majors."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"In my (1/e)*100 years on this planet, during which I devoured at least ten times as many books, I have read only two more than once - &quot;Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance&quot; is one of them. In this monumental 1974 work, Robert Pirsig has achieved what few others have managed before him and, to the best of my knowledge, nobody else has accomplished since: a perfect unification of philosophy, adventure and mystery. His &quot;Chautauqua,&quot; or traveling tale, takes the reader on a profound tour of ancient Greek philosophy, the steppes of Montana, and even a little bit of Zen Buddhism, with endless surprises and much original if not truly inspired thought along the way. Through his self-portrayal by means of the unforgettable and eerily enigmatic character Phaedrus, Mr. Pirsig shares his far-reaching search for the meaning of life, and himself. His fundamental concern is with the following seemingly simple but in effect infinitely complex question: &quot;How can one distinguish &quot;good&quot; from &quot;bad?&quot; The question is posed and addressed in many different forms throughout the book, and in the process the concepts of truth, value and quality are dissected, reassembled, and again dissected and reassembled many times. Mr. Pirsig has an uncanny sense of timing, and he never allows the heavier passages to labor on too long. This is avoided by craftily interspersing his philosophical discourse amongst very down-to-earth and charming observations made during a motorcycle trip that takes the narrator and his seemingly troubled son Chris from the American Prairies to the Pacific, and forms the prevalent background for the entire &quot;Chautauqua.&quot; &quot;Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance&quot; is a totally unique creation. Not being one to lend himself easily to corny clich&eacute;s, I nevertheless believe that this is one book that definitely could dramatically change your life, whether or not you believe in Zen or have ever sat on a motorcycle. If you love somebody, buy them this book"},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"Part road novel, part philosophy, Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance (&quot;ZMM&quot;) met with huge critical and commercial success when first published in 1974. Narrator and son ride from Minneapolis to San Francisco; meanwhile, both are haunted by the narrator's past insanity, brought about by his &quot;chasing the ghost of rationality&quot;. A series of philosophical monologues addresses questions both mundane - how to fix a motorcycle - and metaphysical.Today ZMM retains a sizeable following, although criticism of it is very polarised: Pirsig's fervent self-assurance when dealing with philosophical questions converts some readers into &quot;followers&quot; and tends to exasperate everyone else. Mostly structured as a &quot;solution&quot; rather than an &quot;inquiry&quot;, as the title claims, ZMM's philosophy is too often accepted without question, and it is frequently and regrettably true that the more positive the review, the more philosophically nave the reviewer. Nonetheless, this should not disallow ZMM from being considered on its own merits.ZMM is not an introductory philosophy text, more a &quot;once-in-a-lifetime&quot; philosophical statement; the comparison has already been made with Hofstadter's &quot;G&ouml;del, Escher, Bach&quot;, and Hofstadter's description - &quot;a statement of my religion&quot; - could well describe ZMM, too. When one considers the motivation required to sustain Pirsig's long and solitary struggle in writing and publishing ZMM, the rhetorical fervour of his arguments becomes more understandable. Those who attack Pirsig as pompous or narcissistic fail to appreciate the degree of self-belief needed to complete such a highly individualistic work. So, we can certainly admire him for trying - but is ZMM any good?Some of Pirsig's arguments rest uneasily, such as his blithe acceptance of scientific relativism; and in rejecting subject-object dualism, he paints himself into some peculiar corners, such as his disquiet at the lack of beer cans littering Crater Lake National Park. But there is much in ZMM that is good and thought-provoking, too, especially where education is concerned: all teachers should read this book. And even during his tougher metaphysical monologues, only the driest, most rigid mindset could fail to find Pirsig's rhetoric engaging. Here, his wild claims about the importance of his philosophical arguments are gently counterbalanced by his acknowledged previous insanity: Pirsig takes care to label them the &quot;ramblings of a madman&quot;, though not without a certain knowing irony.ZMM is not just philosophy: it is also a fine piece of travel writing, and a history of Pirsig's teaching career. It remains a novel, however, and not an autobiography: whilst the events described did occur, subtle details have been changed. Most importantly, Robert Pirsig &quot;the author&quot; differs from the narrator, who in turn differs from his former personality (&quot;Phaedrus&quot;). The subtle conflict between the narrator's unifying philosophy, and the barely resolved tensions between narrator/Phaedrus and narrator/son, produces a fully intended irony. Criticism of the narrator is unfair and misguided when it is directed at the author.Pirsig writes with great clarity. Well-structured sentences and careful use of italics give his writing great explanatory power, reminiscent, for this reviewer, of the biologist Richard Dawkins. We may not agree with Pirsig, but we are rarely in any doubt about what he means to say. Nonetheless, there are inevitable uncertainties at the core of ZMM, concerning reason and its limits. The antipsychiatric &quot;insanity as enlightenment&quot; nettle is never fully grasped, though one senses that this is Pirsig's belief; moreover, the analytic intractability of the Eastern philosophy that he embraces means that ultimately, the &quot;inquiry&quot; never reasons its way to an answer. Those seeking an absolutist metaphysical system will not find it here, and one can imagine Pirsig's sense of unease at becoming a latter-day religious guru.ZMM is very much unique: four and a half years in the writing, but decades, one senses, in the germination. Fans will enjoy the 25 or so extra pages, cut from the original manuscript, available in DiSanto's &quot;Guidebook to ZMM&quot; - but skip the dreadful philosophy chapters. Pirsig wrote a sequel of sorts, &quot;Lila&quot;, in 1991, but its sour atmosphere and slack reasoning make it strictly for the converted. Evidently Pirsig coped badly with his post-ZMM fame: one can imagine the sackloads of witless fan-mail. Unquestionably, for this reviewer, ZMM can stand alone: a model of clarity in written argument, a fine American road novel, and an inspiring demonstration of one man's ability to think for himself."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"I first read this book in 1975. I particularly appreciated then the concrete illustrations used in the development of Pirsig's philosophy. However, I was not prepared at that time to follow the details of the logic used to develop his main point, namely, that in ancient Greece rationality had unfairly toppled mysticism as a valid source of knowledge.I always intended to read the book again and finally last month I found an open week, bought a copy of the new 25th anniversary edition, and went at it. The text is unchanged in content but the print is larger and much easier to read than in my old paperback edition. The margins are wider and allow more annotations. It is well worth getting this Anniversary edition.This time I got much deeper into Pirsig's main premise--the one noted above. Pirsig believes Quality to be the missing element in today's culture, but he says it must be kept undefined so that rationality will not be able to kill it again as it did thousands of years ago.My major satisfaction from this novel still comes from the unusually perceptive and cleverly-wrought metaphors that Pirsig presents to advance his philosophical arguments. I have so many favorite ones it is difficult to choose among them. For instance, he labels the University as &quot;Church of Reason,&quot; indicating it fanatical devotion to rationality at the expense of other values not approachable through rational means. No wonder professors of philosophy feel threatened. Rationality is their bread and butter!Other illustrations: He compares the experience of looking out of a framed car window with the frameless view you get riding a motorcycle and uses this as an example of breaking down the subject/object boundary. He indicates that his objective is not to deal with &quot;the 'news,' the silt of tomorrow&quot; which accumulates when the river of culture bends, but to try to deepen the channels of &quot;the best&quot; that lies ahead along the river's future course. He likes to follow &quot;an arrow that enlarges sideways in flight&quot; rather then tracking its forward path in order to find &quot;lateral truths&quot; that point to falseness of axioms which prevent hitting the target. He points out that &quot;institutions such as schools, churches, government, and political organizations of every sort all tend to direct thought for ends other than truth, namely, for the perpetuation of their own functions.&quot; I have often pondered this telling truth.Ultimately, he finds Quality to be the uppermost element of the triad of truth--the creator of both subject and object, residing in the interface between the two. His comparison of Quality with the ancient text of the Tao is exhilarating!The Quality of this novel is extraordinary for me. It exhibits many of the aspects of Quality in writing such as integrity, imagination, flux, continuity, suspense, insight, pathos, and allegory as it attempts to find the missing element in today's technology-dominated world. It is one of the five formative books in my life, and has a place on my &quot;favorites&quot; bookshelf next to Walt Whitman's &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot; and the poems and essays of D.H. Lawrence."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"I first read Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance as a college senior twenty-five years ago. I remember then being frightened by how this man's determination to pursue a philosophical idea to its conclusion, even if it were against the grain of established conventions of thinking, drove him insane. I was afraid deeper study and questioning might do the same to me. I know now, however, that I'm not insane. I also know that twenty-five years ago this story of a man and his son travelling by motorcycle from Minnesota to the Pacific Ocean took deep residence in my soul.I've been a teacher now for twenty-three years, long enough to forget some of my initial influences. But, as I read this book all these years later, I realized that my philosophical view points, examples I use to illustrate ideas with my students, what I believe the purpose of an education is, and several other bits of pedagogy and ideology originated in Pirig's story.I highly recommend this book, maybe especially if you are unread in philosophy and would like a readable, enjoyable, and provocative entree into the history and vocabulary of philosophy.It's a deeply moving, intellectually stiumlating story. Its devotion to story-telling and philosophical inpuiry is indeed most rare."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"Before reviewing Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, let me mention that most people will either love or hate the book. Few will be indifferent.Those who will love the book will include those who enjoy philosophy, especially those who are well read in that subject; people who ride and maintain their own motorcycles; readers who are interested in psychology, particularly in terms of the mass hypnosis of social concepts; individuals who are curious about the line we draw between sanity and insanity; and people who want to think about how to deal with troubling personal situations, especially as a parent. As someone who has all of these interests and perspectives, the book fit my needs very well.Those who will dislike the book are people who like lots of action in their novels, dislike the subjects described above, and who want easy reading. This book is very thick with concepts, ideas, metaphors, and layering which reward careful reading and thought. Most text books are considerably easier to read and understand. Few modern novels are any more difficult to read from an intellectual and emotional perspective.Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance has several story lines that intertwine to create a synthesis of thought and experience:- a father and young son take a motorcycle trip from the Midwest to California- the father has an internal dialogue with himself about what he observes about the people around him and their engagement with life and technology- the father attempts to reconstruct the ideas and perspective he had before being treated as a mental patient (which treatment destroyed and distorted his memory and personality)- the father looks at the great philosophers of western and eastern civilization and attempts to integrate their thoughts into an aesthetic built around our ability to know quality when we see and experience it- the father deals with the incipient signs of mental instability in his son and himself.The book is almost impossible to characterize, but let me try anyway. Perhaps the closest book to this one is Hermann Hesse's Siddharta. At the same time, there is also a strong flavor of Zen and the Art of Archery. On the Road by Jack Kerouac covers some of the same intellectual and emotional territory. John Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men considers some of the same questions of personal perspective. In terms of challenging the constrictions of society, there is also an element of The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit here.What is most remarkable about the book is the way that it pinpoints the spiritual vacuum in the pursuit of more and shinier personal items. Unlike many books from this time, Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance upholds a concept of nobility and worth connected to pursuing material progress in ways that reflect eliminating low quality and replacing it with high quality. Think of this as being like the joy of craftsmanship, compared to the dullness of the assembly line. By setting high standards, expanding those standards, sharing those standards with others, and inspiring people to experience life more fully, we can move forward spiritually as well as intellectually. The motorcycle maintenance details connect these abstractions back to the practical issues of every day, as we roll along across country with the author and his son dealing with the realities of keeping our bike running where the repair and parts options are very limited.The book's afterward is particularly interesting, in which Mr. Pirsig opines about why this book has had such great and lasting appeal and tells you what happened after the book ends.Ultimately, I felt uplifted by the high respect that Mr. Pirsig has for his readers. He takes us very seriously, thinks we are intelligent, and pays us the compliment of believing that we can learn to fundamentally change all of our perspectives and experiences.After you finish this book (if you decide to read it), I suggest that you think about where you disengaged from the challenges, tasks, and people around you. Then, pick out one area and get deeply involved. As you master that one, take on another. And so on. Soon, you will have new and greater respect for yourself . . . and more rewarding relationships.Get your hands dirty!"},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"In Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, Robert Pirsig apparently achieved what many philosophers desire, but simply do not have the skill or perseverance to do. That is, he wrote a work of philosophy that received immense attention and success from the popular culture and audience.An immense part of this success probably lies in his blending of narrative with philosophical inquiry. He also has clear prose that allows everything to flow together quite nicely. Once you are sufficiently involved in the narrative and developing line of thought, you are allowed to move on naturally into more involved lines of philosophical thought that you might never have sought to understand otherwise. Pirsig also brings up a number of troubling issues about the way that we think and the way that we live: something seems wrong with our lives. He has a lucid manner of illustrating these dissatisfactions and confusions, which pull us in even deeper in anticipation of where he will end up.This is all very good, but after all, this book is supposed to be an inquiry into values, a philosophically moving work. So what we really want to know is: should we take seriously the conclusions that Pirsig reaches in this book? Does he present a serious challenge to the more commonly held theories of reality and \`Quality', and provide a robust new vision for living? I think here Pirsig misses the mark on several counts. First off, when all is said and done it's not clear at all that he has provided a rich new vision for living. From the standpoint of philosophy, Pirsig often makes intractable jumps in his reasoning as well as unqualified assumptions that severely weaken his case. The most fatal instance of this is in his attempt to show that the \\"dualistic\\" understanding of reality cannot make room for Quality.Here I will only attempt to give a few concise examples of the problems that plague Pirsig's reasoning in Zen. Unfortunately as a short review I must be quite brief and a bit shallow in analysis. But my only intention here is to give readers incentive to be cautious about thinking seriously about some of Pirsig's claims by showing some serious flaws in his thinking.In one instance, on 40-44 we enter a discussion about whether the law of gravity exists objectively or only in our minds. There are extensive problems with the argument, but only a few need mention here. Pirsig asks if the law of gravity existed before the earth, sun, moon, or anything material existed, and having no mass, no energy, not in anyone's mind, and not in space (41). Now Pirsig seems to think that the law of gravity did not exist at this point. But then Pirsig makes an absurd jump in his reasoning. He concludes that the only rational conclusion is that the law of gravity did not exist before Isaac Newton. But he clearly has given no support for this claim. Why not think the law of gravity existed after the beginning of the universe, but before Isaac Newton?From this intractable argument Pirsig proceeds to claim that the law of gravity exists nowhere except in people's heads (42). He characterizes Newton's discovery of gravity as Newton's having discovered disembodies words that had been floating around for billions of years. But why think anything like that? Is Pirsig now assuming some unfamiliar philosophy of language? Why not think that Newton simply discovered regularity in nature that can be articulated by human language? At any rate Pirsig has not given us nearly enough to take his claim seriously.Of course the natural next step is that \\"the world has no existence whatsoever outside the human imagination\\" (43). But it's clear from above that no such thing has been demonstrated. Some at this point may feel that I am being unfair or mischaracterizing Pirsig's argument. But this is hardly so. Simply put, there is little substance to this argument (and many others in his book) examined carefully.Another problem is that Pirsig is simply careless in some places in his assumptions or by not defending some assertions he makes. For instance, early on and at other random times in the book, Pirsig mentions the Buddha as an aspect of reality as if the reader would never dispute the truth of Buddhism (i.e. 21-22). On the other hand, his ridiculously brief consideration of Christianity, which has probably had the biggest effect on western culture than any other movement, amounts to his saying that \\"\\"Heaven above\\" fades from meaning when space-age consciousness asks, Where is \\"above\\"?\\" (237). Pirsig claims that Christianity has lost relevance and comprehensibility. But for whom? Not only does he not explain what he means, but he seems to ignore the fact that Christianity really is relevant and comprehensible for hundreds of millions of people today, even many living in the \\"space-age\\". On the other hand, it's fine to employ Buddhism at points as an unqualified assumption.The biggest problem for Pirsig is that he does nothing to show that the \\"dualistic\\" conception of reality cannot allow for Quality. The dualistic conception is (to be overly simple) that we are subjects that are distinct from the objects in the world. Pirsig spends much of the latter part of his book explaining his conception of Quality, which involves Quality as the source of everything, in response to the failure of the dualistic conception to deal with Quality. Yet it's not clear from any point in Pirsig's analysis that the dualistic conception is inadequate to include Quality, or beauty, or spirituality, or anything aesthetic or emotional. How does the distinctness of subject and object prevent these things? Why cannot beauty be a quality of objects? It is interesting that Pirsig seems to ignore contemporary philosophy that studies aesthetics from a \\"dualistic\\" standpoint. Many have accepted this picture and found ample room for a richness of beauty and quality that is in no way hindered by the distinctness of subject and object.In addition to this, Pirsig seems almost incoherent about his theory of Quality. He wants to say that it is indefinable. Yet he tries to explain his theory of Quality in detail. On some level he recognizes this dilemma. Nevertheless, despite his normally clear prose, his explanation of Quality is mostly unhelpful. I looked at many of these sections carefully without much progress. I take it that this is not because he has something deeply profound to say, but that he himself does not sufficiently understand what he means so that he can articulate it. If he understood it well enough, he ought to be able to articulate it as he does so well in the rest of his book.Though I don't doubt some will disagree about this last point, the fact remains that there is no good reason for us to throw our common sense out the window and go with the evasive theory that Pirsig presents, a theory that by the way has received virtually no attention in professional philosophy. (And I'd add here that Pirsig's dismissal of \\"common sense\\" is also supported by weak reasoning) Pirsig in the end gives us no reason to move towards his solution.Whether Pirsig intended it or not, he has not really provided us with anything approaching a robust and meaningful way of how to live our lives. In part, this is probably a result of the evasiveness of Quality itself. It's a bit baffling that so many find the philosophy deeply affecting and inspirational, whereas we are not truly given a rich sense of how to live our lives and how to treat others. We are given the picture that all is Quality. Yet we have been told Quality is indefinable, and in a sense beyond understanding. We fail even to find in his narrative something of a way we ought to live.All that Pirsig discusses is not necessarily bad. I like that Pirsig points out some misunderstandings about the \`scientific method', specifically that a big part of it is not methodical but sometimes simply the result of imagination or accident (though again I think he takes his conclusions a step too far here). Also, Pirsig does make some good distinctions and presents a number of problems with the way we live that certainly need attention. Our educational system is one of those issues.Nevertheless, I cannot in good conscience recommend this book because it contains a wealth of misleading philosophy. I'm sure that many people when reading Zen have been taken in by the problems with our world and the intellectual puzzles that Pirsig discusses, thinking then that his solutions to these issues are the only salvation. But nothing could be further from the truth."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"If you are thinking of reading this book there are some things you should know right off. 1. This is not a book about Buddhism, or Zen. It explores the ways in which eastern philosophies can help western thinkers move toward Quality. 2. This book covers a lot of ground, very quickly and is not a philosophical textbook. If you don't know much about philosophy, this book will not change that fact, but it will make you question a lot of the assumptions you have made. 3. This book will change your life! This book is about Quality. If you have read the Tao Te Ching, you have already read a book which attempts to explain Quality. It is the unnamable, the One. Pirsig asks us to question whether science and logic can really bring us closer to the &quot;Truth.&quot; Ever since Socrates began using the dialectic to try to discover Truth, humans have been on a quest to find it. The tool we use is known as scientific method. We have been using scientific method for a long time, and it has given us a lot of useful knowledge. It has not, however, brought us any closer to finding an absolute Truth, which is true for everyone everwhere. Quality is undefinable. It comes before thought, and before actions. Any attempt at describing it is useless, because as soon as you attempt to categorize it, you are only talking about one aspect of it. What Pirsig does in this book, is attempt to show us ways that we can use Quality in our lives. He calls his main character Phaedrus. Which comes from Plato's dialogue by the same name. Reading this dialogue will help you immensely in following the arguments he presents. Don't be fooled by this into thinking that Pirsig is a Platonist. Phaedrus was a Sophist, as is the Phaedrus in this book. Neither the historical Sophists, or Pirsig, buy into Plato's concept of absolute &quot;Truth.&quot; If you are at all interested in the ideas of subjectivity and the influence of location (in time and space) as it relates to philosophical, religious and scientific claims, this book will greatly interest you. If you're a &quot;post-modernist&quot; you've probably already read this book, and if not, this book will help you to crystallize a lot of your objections to Modernism. If you feel that the world is becoming more and more empty and hollow, and think that part of your basic humanity has been stolen by alarm clocks, concrete, automobiles, and (can I say it?) computers, this book may help you in finding the Quality that resides within technology, yet is so often ignored by those who wield technology like a biological weapon. If you've ever thought that the whole world was crazy, and want to learn more about what really makes a person &quot;insane,&quot; you should know that this book is written from the perspective of an insane man. If you are searching for answers, this book will give you a few more questions, and help you realize that life is about the questions, not the answers!"},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"&quot;Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance&quot; is an entire experience in philosophy and spirituality condensed into what I found to be a very thought-provoking anti-novel. It has three main &quot;streams&quot; of thought: the story of the motorcycle-riding narrator and his son, the story of Phaedrus, and the Chautauqua that is the narrator's way of explaining Phaedrus' philosophy.Though the first two chapters of the narrator's musings are slow to bring the reader into the plot, intriguing mystery elements are revealed by the end of Chapter 3. By this time, the reader should know that Phaedrus spent his whole life searching for a ghost, found the ghost, &quot;thrashed it good,&quot; and became one himself. However, the nameless narrator cannot tell Phaedrus' story without also giving the reader a crash-course in history, philosophy, and of course, motorcycle maintenance (through the Chautauqua, of course). I now warn those who cannot bear long lectures about dead historical figures, slippery concepts or technical minutiae to leave this book alone.Part I of the book is set chiefly in the Dakotas. During this part, the Chautauqua mostly discusses the classical-romantic split in people's thinking. What makes Robert M. Pirsig's discussions unique is how he deftly brings Zen concepts into the reader's understanding of the split.Part II begins with the narrator's arrival in Montana. It is the reader's first real encounter with Phaedrus (an unforgettable, though hardly endearing, character) and the first introduction to the &quot;ghost&quot; that he so passionately pursued. (The ghost's name: REASON. One of its popular haunts: SCIENTIFIC METHOD.)Part III takes place during and right after the narrator and his son's hike up a mountain. The chapters in this section are almost entirely devoted to the Chautauqua. The discussion of the ghost of Reason is dropped and a full, in-depth explanation of something outside Reason, Quality, is taken up. Pirsig takes great pains to say how Quality determines our values, creates our mythos and touches our hearts. Those who like taking detours when an interesting topic distracts them will love this part. Those who don't care for such detours and want to get on with the story will find this part long-winded and over-written. (This is their second warning!)Part IV continues and ends Phaedrus' story as the narrator and his son go through Oregon and California. In the Chautauqua, Quality is joined by Reason once more. The reader finds out how Phaedrus travelled to the University of Chicago, took his philosophical inquiry to its logical end, and finally became a &quot;ghost&quot; himself. His conclusions about what is Real, about what is True, about what is Beautiful, and about what is Best, can prove liberating to anyone who has been independently wondering about them. The ending also contains an interesting twist in the story of the narrator and his son.I can find connections between the ideas in this novel and those in the essays of Ralph Waldo Emerson, the parables of Kahlil Gibran, the poetry of T. S. Eliot, the books of the Bible, and other great spiritual or philosophical literature that generations have read and shared. (Pirsig even explains the why and how of this phenomenon in the Chautauqua.) To best enjoy this story, the reader must relate to it--or resonate to it."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"I've been meaning to read Pirsig's Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance for some time now. I finally got around to reading it (or in this case listening to it) and, in general, I liked it. However, I also have a few complaints.First the good stuff. I enjoyed Pirsig's overall presentation and narrative style. His writing is animated and hyperdescriptive. This fact really brings the characters and their situations to life for the reader. I think this book is as timely as ever now, especially with the further explosion of technology since its original publication. As an engineer, his complaints about engineering and science without feeling and craftsmanship is spot on. His warnings about an ever present consumer, throwaway culture were prescient indeed.The idea of using the motorcycle journey through the American west as a metaphor for his own journey through the landscape of philosphical thought was well chosen. It definitely has a modern Thoreau quality to it. Although there is plenty of purely abstract philosophical discussion in here, some of the thoughts presented are not just esoteric topics but also practical and timeless questions every man should ask himself at some point in his life. Who am I? What do I believe in? What is my role as a father, a teacher, and a student in the face of life's messiness and uncertainties? Should I tell my kid the harsh truth or should I give him a sugar-coated, Walt Disney version of life? Should one just unquestioningly accept the status quo and reap life's material rewards by \\"playing the game\\" or should one take the painful high road and rock the boat by seeking the truth for its own value? Pirsig clearly prefers the latter and so he bucks the authority of the hoity-toity academic establishment. For this his alter-ego character Phaedrus becomes the book's protagonist. However, as with everything, it comes at a cost. A big cost. I can personally relate to many of these ideas.I like that Pirsig offers no easy answers to any of these questions either. He contemplates, contemplates some more, comes to a conclusion, doubles back, takes a mental turn, stops, contemplates some more all the while pondering each question with as much clarity as humanly possible.My biggest complaint with the book was that it was a bit longwinded in places. Much of the abstract philosphical discussions on quality were excessive and unnecessary and could've been condensed a bit. It seemed like alot pointless mental tallywacking to me. Ironically, Pirsig seems to come to the very same conclusion by the end of it all. Perhaps it was just part of a whole cathartic journey for him that needed to be worked through, I don't know.All in all I liked this book though and I would recommend it to anyone with a patient, thoughtful side. Results-oriented types might find it irritating though. As I said, it offers no easy answers but instead raises many questions. It also makes some interesting observations on modern life and the culture we live in. Recommended."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"A serious and beautiful effort on providing insights into the concept of &quot;quality&quot;. I enjoyed it thoroughly.I feel that the attitude of Mr. Pirsig and his alter-ego protagonist Phaedrus have many things in common with a Zen practitioner. The motorcycle, by the way, is his modern-day lotus flower."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"As a philosopher, Pirsig has gained very little recognition, even though his book has been around for 23 years. You will not find his name or his work anywhere within philosophical encyclopedias, or any other kind of encyclopedia for that matter. I've wondered for many years why that is the case. It is true that the Metaphysics of Quality is not very compatible with most of the great Western philosophies, but nonetheless, I've found it incredible in scope, vision and depth. It is a book which contains principles applicable to almost anyone, anywhere, anytime here on earth, and its applicability owes much to the fact that it is very simple to read, though the ideas it explores - especially when dealing with Kant and Poincare - can become mind-boggling; fortunately this is not the case when it discusses Quality. It is true that Pirsig can sound rather sophistic at times, everyone, even the revered Socrates and Plato, are guilty of that. What really matters is that on the whole, Pirsig can hardly fail to deeply affect anyone who reads him with an open mind.

It's not actually one book--it's a three. On one level, it's a textbook of philosophy, rolling back over important ground often missed by more scholarly works. Beneath that it is a book about motorcycles and touring, taking you to why do it, and how to make it a pleasant experience. Beyond that, and even more earthshakingly, it takes you into a man's personal struggle with his personal demons and history on a cross-country trip with his son.No other book can I re-read again, and again, each time taking new layers and subtleties from a painfully honest and open review of one man's world, from how to use a wrench, to living a quality life.

On one hand I thought the incorporation of a Walden-like adventure mixed with philosophical propositions was fascinating and well integrated into the story. On the other hand the material was sometimes too dry and had repetitive, circular logic that seemed to be an exercise in rhetoric. At times I was completely engrossed and jotting down notes for further research, then at other times the writing seemed so trite that I found myself impatiently waiting to finish it. Overall the book is an intelligent work that has personally inspired a pursuit in philosophers such as Hume, Kant, and the Greeks. But an appreciation and prerequisite knowledge of these philosophers would have made the book far more accessible."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"As a professor of philosophy and a former mechanic in the Marine Corps I can see why many see Pirsig's book as daunting, thick, and stifling. It is filled with philosophical history, philosophical thought, deep forays taking you to dizzying heights of thought - and smashing into the depths of a single screw on a motorcycle. I do think that the novice in either of these realms, philosophy or mechanics, would be well served to push through this book.It is well written, paced, and fleshed out. An excellent book for anyone who has time and wants to read something 'deep'.With all of that said - I could not help but think that Pirsig's foray into insanity could have been prevented had he searched for 'quality' in the Buddhists. He seems to have driven himself insane because he was attempting to reinvent the wheel.This is not a draw back - but merely an observation. I will not be assigning this in any class I teach soon - but I constantly recommend it to students who are 'ready'."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"Essentially this book is a treatise on a man's ardent search for himself, which has been lost somewhere in the shadows of an obscure past. The theme opens up and is nourished by the first person account of an intense journey undertaken by him on his motorcycle across parts of mainland America. Throughout the course of his journey, he analyses, with passion, and he reasons, without inhibitions; and he raises forth some of the most fundamental questions appertaining to human existence and human action. And brilliantly, he provides answers to most of them; sometimes citing instances of motorcycle maintenance (he reasons that a motorcycle can quite relevantly depict the mechanism of rationality and human life; so the art of motorcycle maintenance is essentially the art of running the machine of the human mind), sometimes citing tenets of the ancient Zen religion and at other times by employing his own irrefutable arguments. Very aptly paced, the book builds up its tempo as it proceeds and ultimately culminates in an intense climax (of course, not a dramatic one!). This book has to be devoured slowly, word by word, argument by argument, and one will certainly get more than involved. Certainly not for the purpose of frivolous reading, this book is meant for those who are at least somewhat into heavy reading. The author's arguments and criticisms in this book are sharp, appealing, and set on a terra firma of awe-inspiring logic; his narratives are intensely passionate and his philosophies brilliant and thought provoking. This book might provide answers to some of the questions that may have been tormenting one's mind since long, or, perhaps, not strangely though, it might raise in one's mind more questions that it would ever be able to answer."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"Read this if you are a searcher.

The ideas that most Americans think of as common sense often were first promulgated by some long dead philosopher, like Aristotle, and were accepted by most people only after decades or centuries of conflict and debate. One of the most important things that Buddhism in general and Zen in particular teaches is that language is only a tool, that words themselves are at best approximations of what we are trying to describe or to convey, and that we need to remember that in everyday life. Human language can never accurately describe any absolute, universal truths. It only follows that anyone who claims to be able to fully describe how the world works is full of excrement and should not be followed. Pirsig knows this, and never says he knows how to explain it all, and readers who want to have it all explained are going to be disappointed or even angry. His defense of the Sophists comes 2000 years too late, but it is the best one I, who once actually studied Greek philosophy in depth, have ever encountered. At the same time, Pirsig recognizes the benefits we have reaped from Platonic and Aristotelian logic, such as the Renaissance, the Enlightenment, the scientific method, the internal combustion powered engine, and technology in general. This book certainly doesn't trash technology, it just points out that technology is another set of tools to make life easier for us although sometimes we screw up how we use it, just like we screw up when we think we can explain God or Absolute Truth or the Ultimate Whatever with any accuracy. We can only do the best we can, and Phaedrus does, as does his son.

Yet my years of studying zen reveal no such correlation between this individual who has learned to not try is the best way to not succeed (ref. the story of climbing the mountain with his son). Unfortunately, he is trying to pass this message on to others. If the story was written with less talent one could see the flaws inherent in this philosophy. It is as if one desired Marilyn Monroe's lifestyle because she brought such penache to the screen. In the end the only real loser is one who quits, and that seems to be lost on Pirsig."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"I regularly give copies to people that I really care about. They have never failed to become absorbed in the quest, both the character's and their own life's. Unfortunately, it will place you at odds with the rest of the world, especially the corporate world, where a good spreadsheet or &quot;running the numbers&quot; is all that it takes to make a go/no go decision... or to call a management failure a success. You may, therefore, find that the main character's descent into insanity, is not unlike the feeling you will get when you see the blank stares from friends and acquaintances when you try to explain what quality is and what it is not.

It will quietly dig deep into your mind before blowing it apart (more completely than with the best of mind-expanding drugs) with simple truths about life.

For me this book was one of those events. It is easy to get excited when reviewing a book that you particularly liked so colouring your review of it with overemphasised &quot;rhetoric&quot; which other people generally take with-a-pinch-of-salt anyway. The facts are that this was very good book. I didn't open the book looking for what other people had told me was there. I wasn't looking to agree or disagree with Persig I just 'listened'. His words were not so much a guide (as some people say) but more a key which unlocked a way of thinking clouded by modern society. Everybody has questions. I think the problem that alot of people have with this book is that they expect to be handed the answers by Persig. All I can say is read with an open mind and let this book be the catalyst to your own journey."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"I liked this book very much. I give it a 4, rather than a 5 simply because I have a few minor structural or stylistic complaints.To me it was a novel and successful approach to bring the philosophical ranting and daily life together, as well as find connecting links between religion, art and science. I think, for example, that ZAMM does a better and more beautiful job at it then Hofstadter's &quot;Goedel, Echer, Bach&quot;.I was particularly interested to read negative criticism for the book by readers here at Amazon. I wasn't happy with them. A score of ad hominem attacks on Pirsig, from people who are either bored with this kind of non-academic or philosophical stuff or were looking for a tractate on Zen, a manual for motorcycle maintenance, or a doctoral dissertation in philosophy.This book is neither, and perhaps that was exactly the point of it. I am really open for someone to rip this book apart, to show that it does not have Quality. They could start, for example, by telling us what Quality is."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"I read this book twenty years ago, and I still think about it. That, to me, is the measure of a great book.Pirsig, of course, is writing on many levels, but the central theme is hinted at in the title. &quot;Zen&quot; is all about experiencing things directly, immediately, without a preconceived intellectual filter. Zen Buddhism is very anti-intellectual. &quot;Motorcycle Maintenance&quot;, to be done well, requires a deep conceptual understanding of how a motorcycle works, and a scientific approach to trouble-shooting. Pirsig is trying, with mixed success, to reconcile what he calls &quot;romantic&quot; (immediate or &quot;Eastern&quot;) thought with &quot;classical&quot; (scientific or Western) thought.Pirsig believes that the reconciliation lies in a deeper (pre-classical) understanding of &quot;quality&quot;. Quality is neither objective nor subjective, it is prior to them, it is the primordial ether from which the objective/subjective dualism arises. (I do not do him justice here, if you are interested, read the book.)What makes the book work is that it that style of writing is a labratory for the concepts he his presenting.His prose is simple, almost poetic, when describing what is around him and his relationships to his son and his past self. His honesty and directness are alternately refreshing and alarming. Then he shifts gears and tries to unravel and re-weave many of the core issues in Western Philosophy. He manages this without resorting to an academic style or stuffiness.Pirsig, is a gifted thinker and writer, and certainly not a conventional one. He is a philosopher in that he is working through original ideas with courage and clarity. In the end, like most true philosophers, his philosophy is intertwined with a self-analysis and catharsis, yet has broader meaning and applicability.There are, I presume, flaws in his reading of the ancients, and I think that his conclusions rely to much on the multiple definitions of the word &quot;quality&quot;. The merit of his metaphysics should be discussed but mostly I admire his grit, honesty and gumption to write such a text. It is those characteristics that I would most like to emulate.I also recommend the sequel, &quot;Lila&quot;. It is more down to earth, but equally couragous and fascinating."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"Pirsig provides a heavy inquiry into the nature of science, philosohpy, quality and pursuit of universal truth in this book. He uses a \\"scientific method\\" in describing his inquiry. Being a scientist myself, I found his book disappointing. I was excited in the topics he pursued, but there are some flaws in his reasoning that are hidden in his heavy language --- these flaws amount simply to rhetoric in retrospect. To provide an example of such flaws, consider what Phaedrus, his alter-ego, says about the nature of scientific truths and scientific methods.Phaedrus postulates that the number of scientific hypotheses to explain a given worldly phenomenon increases with the amount of exploration. As you apply scientific method to test a hypothesis, new hypotheses develop. Thus, Phaedrus feels that all these hypotheses can never be tested because the number to be tested grows at a faster rate with the number being tested. He quotes Einstein to sum this up, to conclude that (scientific) truth is a function of time -- at any given moment, there is one amongst a set of hypotheses that best explains a phenomenon.But, from here, Phaedrus makes the statement that \\"the time spans of scientific truths are an inverse function of the intensity of scientific effort\\". This claim, to me, is unsubstantiated. Phaedrus seems to justify this claim by saying that asmore hypotheses come into existence, the probability that the leading hypothesis (call it the momentary truth referred to by Einstein) is replaced by a new hypothesis is greater because the number of alternatives is greater.The primary flaw in reasoning is that it ignores that the quality or soundness of the available hypotheses. In other words, they are all equivalent and the probability of one replacing the other are all equal. I prefer to resort to an alternative explanation of this phenomenon. Let an n-dimensional space represent all the scientific hypotheses offered to explain a phenomenon. If there does exist a scientific truth (let's call this our goal), that isirrefutable, then it must be a point in this space, and reaching this point is the objective of all scientific methods. At a given instant in time, we may be aware of a set of hypotheses (or points in this space), and we know that one point in this space refers to the momentary truth referred to by Einstein.What Phaedrus seems to ignore is that good scientific methods at a given instant in time will use its current knowledge (i.e., points in the space we are aware of) to guide its exploration through this space. This is the foundation of any good scientific research. Take any article written in a scientific journal, and you will find a section dedicated to related research, which considers what hypotheses have been discovered, and how does the new hypothesis presented compare with the previous results. The result of using current knowledge is to fine-tune the exploration of the hypotheses space. Thus, the aim of research is to figure out what parts of this space may be meaningless to pursue (in other words, what new hypotheses are probably weaker in the test of time), and thus turn in the direction of the hypothesis that will stand the test of time. This direction, hopefully, is towards the point that we have set as our goal. Thus, from this standpoint, our path through this space will be fine-tuned with time and will in fact increase our chances of reaching our goal. The weakness in Phaedrus argument is his own critique on the\\"romantic\\" method --- he feels overwhelmed with new hypotheses that pop up all the time. In feeling overwhelmed, he gets dis-oriented, and loses sight of our current path in this space.A classic example of this space is our drive to explain gravity in the cosmos. What we know today about Newton's laws of gravity and all other physical laws that are based on it, are that they are observable only on Earth. There is a new approach, string theory, that attempts to tie in gravity with the rest of our physical laws. This is a scientific inquiry into describing a new hypothesis to replace old ones (Newton's laws). We are not being overwhelmed by new hypotheses as time progresses. In fact, Newton's laws are still the best hypotheses explaining the physical phenomenon at this point in eternity. Perhaps, it will be replaced if string-theory researchers encounter a break-through, but this will imply that it is a much stronger hypothesis than Newton's. To Phaedrus, the sheer abundance of new hypotheses is a disappointment.Hence, I dismiss Phaedrus's claim that \\"time spans of scientifictruths are an inverse function of the intensity of scientific effort\\" as pure rhetoric without any basis. In fact, if intensity of scientific effort is well directed, then it provides better focus for our exploration through this space. Thus, I cannot but dismiss the remainder of Phaedrus argument in this chapter relating to \\"the predicted results and actual results of scientific inquiry being diametrically opposite\\", etc. All these corollaries are based on poorly deduced claim.However, there are still a number of very interesting contemplations in the book. I only have trouble with the method of analysis chosen by Pirsig. Ask any scientist and they'll tell you that the most beautiful theorems and laws are the simplest ones. In this regard, Phaedrus's convoluted, heavy analysis fails miserably. It is because of the heavy analysis, that he is able to introduce rhetoric without the reader being even aware of it."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"This is the kind of book that a person who is intelligent but uneducated in philosophy would pick up, read, and be excited and terribly enlightened by. This apparently was the state of many of the &quot;hippies&quot; who read this book when it came out. But for someone who has read Aristotle and Plato and the myriad of others, especially the Greeks, this book can seem almost ridiculously off-center in its generalizations. Whether it is or not, that is for the reader to decide, I suppose.The narrator is at first likeable, but as the book moves on and his madness becomes evident, you see his character become despicable, self-absorbed, mean, closed-minded, and, well, a hypocrite in a number of ways. This change may be a large part of the appeal of this book as a sort of psychological novel, though I am still not sure whether that is what Pirsig intended it to be.Despite the disgust and boredom I sometimes felt while reading, the book has a lot of good things to say about living and the self. Most importantly, if you pay enough attention it will definitely get you thinking. Overall, a controversial book, but worth reading if only for the thought and controversy it will provoke within your own mind."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"This is my second reading of this classic. The first was around '74 when I was actively reading various philosophies and trying to be a normal person. Pirsig just blew me away with his wide-ranging scope and single-minded intensity. ZAMM is a profound accomplishment on both a personal and philosophical level. Phaedrus, a true lone wolf, an outrider by necessity, finally squared the circle and cracked the koan.Businessmen who work their way to wealth through shrewd dealing have many admirers. Even more make heroes of athletes who robustly compete and win medals. I respect Pirsig more. He followed his mental compulsions to their denouement without assistance or thought of personal gain. When some anonymous functionaries at Bozeman try to standardize his teaching, does he have a chat with the department head? Well, of course not. To Phaedrus, his classroom procedures bear the weight of the planet's collective wisedom. He must justify what he does personally and professionally with the only response acceptable to him. And that requires that the entire Western philosophical tradition be tweaked into concordance with the East. The result is an amalgam that will please 1) the over-organized, rational engineers, 2) the spacey meditators seeking nirvana, 3) the spiritual who want God on High, 4) and especially the lone wolves of the mind.Pirsig is not just a philosopher. By training and profession, he is also a rhetorician. That means he presents his case with ability, drama and persuasion. You may not hang on every word, but I can think of no other book that so dramatizes an intellectual battle.Of course he was insane. Of course he treated people badly. But the necessity of resolving such a conundrum is exigent in very few. Fewer still come away with resolution, much less their sanity. If you've ever been in Phaedrus' pack, read this book. The indelible impressions from 30 years are still with me."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"I write only to defend a gifted author's brilliant work of philosophy. I stopped by this page to check the reviews, and was horrified to find so much negative feeling. My argument, obnoxious as it might sound, is that all the gripes others have with this book are rooted in their fundamental misunderstandings of the text.This book is a work of popular philosophy, which explores previously uncharted territory somewhere between Mysticism and dialectical engaging of truth. It deals with an overview of Western though in this area, and proposes its own unique theses. I have changed the way I live my life based upon the sage advice of this novel.As far as I can see it, one of the main criticisms of the novel is that it starts off well, with a compelling problem, and what seems to be an innovative solution to it, but pans out to be an intellectual cop-out. This is not the case. The Amazon.com review declares, \\"His solution to a synthesis of the rational and creative by elevating Quality to a metaphysical level simply repeats the mistakes of the premodern philosophers.\\" Which premodern philosophers would those be? I believe that Mr. Bruya means \\"pre-socratic\\" not \\"pre-modern,\\" but even this criticism is invalid. Pirsig acknowledges that he owes an intellectual debt to the Sophists of ancient Greece, but his ideas far surpass theirs. Rationality, as it exists today, did not exist at the time of the Sophists, therefore he must necessarily expand beyond the scope of their understanding of philosophy to maintain his relevance to the modern day, which he certainly does, through many specific modern examples.Mr. Bruya continues to argue that, \\"the narrator's claims to originality turn out to be overstated, his reasoning questionable, and his understanding of the history of Western thought sketchy.\\" Sure, Mr. Pirsig had intellectual precursors, such as the Sophists, the 20th century pragmatists (William James, etc...), and others, but I challenge anyone reading this to come up with someone who has prefigured Quality. Secondly, his \\"reasoning\\" is \\"questionable\\": give me one example of faulty logic in the book! Pirsig, though he rejects the supremacy of dialectic, is still a master-dialectician, and his logical entrenchments are flawless. Finally, his understanding of Western though is most certainly top-drawer. Yes, it is incomplete, because the majority of Western though does not speak to his point, but that which he does cover is correct. I challenge anyone to come up with an incorrect point he makes about that which he does cover. As a student of philosophy, Mr. Pirsig's command is entirely correct, in my understanding of things.I also challenge whatever Mr. \\"Rampageous Cuss\\" has to say, as I feel that his command of the book, and the ideas therein, is incomplete and juvenile. He states, \\"It's neither well structured nor well written, and its philosophical insights are more deeply felt than deeply thought.\\" The writing is extremely fine, and if Mr. Cuss was not engaged by it, it speaks to his short attention span, not the author's skill. He does not use flowery, empty rhetoric, his writing is immediate and to-the-point, reminiscent of other American greats, such as Thoreau, or Stephen Crane. The structure of the book is extremely complex, and Mr. Cuss' comment on it simply belies his faulty understanding of it. There are, in fact, three separate characters in the book: Phaedrus, the narrator of the novel, and then Robert Pirsig the writer himself. That the narrator seems to contradict his own philosophy is not a flaw in the writing, it is a carefully structured didactic narrative, in which the contradictions are meant to point out the ultimate philosophy of the book. The narrator of the book is not meant to be a morally immaculate character. He is merely a character meant to express a point.Mr. Cuss then says, \\"Unhappily he decides he was a misunderstood genius, names his pre-breakdown self 'Phaedrus' and rambles into a tendentious complaint about academia as he relates his earlier life.\\" Robert Pirsig was a misunderstood genius. What part of this book could be classified as \\"rambling\\" is beyond me. Mr. Pirsig seems sincere and intelligent in every stage of his discourse, and, like all of the other negative reviewers, Mr. Cuss has failed to cite any specific examples of this \\"rambling\\" making himself effectively immune to criticism. His complains about academia are well-supported with specific evidence of his empirical experience in academia. His arguments are all logical and correct.Finally Mr. Cuss makes the grandly fallacious assertion that, \\"as the narrator he is pompous and self obsessed, struggling with a massive inferiority complex. He is given to sweeping pronunciamentos and overblown metaphors.\\" The narrator of the book is meant as a teaching tool, in the same way Plato used the Sophists in his dialogues as advocates of bad ideas to reenforce his overall good ideas. The narrator is meant to seem pretentious and self-contradictory. His terrible relationship with Chris is proof of this. He finishes his speeches on caring about human rapport, and then treats his son horribly. He is a character, meant to illuminate the message of the novel, nothing more. I would also argue that not only are there no \\"overblown\\" metaphors, but that the language is largely non-metaphorical. Pirsig rejects metaphors as a means of understanding, as Plato used them (the Horse and Chariot analogy of the soul comes to mind). If Mr. Cuss is referring to the vague descriptions of Quality, as \\"overblown metaphors,\\" he needs to understand that Quality cannot be subordinated to language, and there is only the realm of analogue to clarify it.Overall, this is the second best book I have ever read, and I assure you all that if you read and take the time to understand this book, you too will love it. It is a sublime journey to the high country of the mind, and you will not be sorry."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"I was recommended \\"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance\\" from someone with a little too much enthusiasm for the book. As a result I was a little let down. My friend's enthusiastic endorsement sounds a lot like the reviews posted up on this page.The key question this book poses--\\"What is Quality?\\"--in my mind is never really answered. This may be like the Zen koan were a monk is hanging off the edge of a cliff by holding onto a branch with his teeth and a student asks him \\"Why did the Buddha come from India to China?\\" If the monk answers, he falls to his doom. If he keeps his mouth shut, he cannot answer. The answer to the question ends up being \\"MU\\", which is a Zen way of saying \\"unask the question\\".All very quaint and insightful, perhaps, but a little over the head of this Western thinker. It's not that I don't enjoy exploring a question I know has no definitive answer, if only to gain an appreciation for the mystery it addresses. The problem is that I dislike metaphysics. I dislike jumping up one level and speaking of things in a convuluted and deliberately confusing matter by making concepts essential objects, by making grandoise claims about what happens between conscious experience and the event one is conscious of in a forum that doesn't demand a rational defense.Pirsig apparently doesn't either, and he offers a few fleeting attempts at self-criticism before jumping right back into the metaphysical lingo and leading the reader back into the fray.The book did get me thinking. I started to wonder \\"What is quality\\", and, more specifically, \\"Does this book have it?\\" As to the first question, I was led to think of it from angles I wouldn't have thought of before, but still am at a total loss. As to the second question, I think the answer is \\"yes\\", but a tentative \\"yes\\". Don't expect your socks to be knocked off by Pirsig's blizkreig through three hundred years of philosophical thought. Expect some uncomfortable chapters, some evocative and highly objectionable claims, and some unnecessarily confusing dialectic.The book has an interesting narrative flow, and when concepts are introduced into this flow it can be quite enlightening. Unfortunately, it sometimes breaks this flow altogether, loses ground, and makes for less enjoyable reading. I recommend the book to those who are interested, specifically, in philosophy (not to be confused with \\"ideas about things\\", but the philosophy of the ancients)."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"In a search for broader intellectual, philosophical, and spiritual vistas, I finally read the book I had been interested in for twenty years. I was ready to read it now, at this stage in my life, as a father, and the result was moving, even disturbing, at a deep level. If I had tried to wade through it twenty years ago, I wouldn't have made it, and if I did, I wouldn't have gotten a lot out of it.It is not an easy read. There are times when it was a workout trying to follow the philosophical discourse. Part of the effort, intentional or not, was that the narrative was tracking the thoughts of an insane man. The thrust of the book, a first-person exposition of schizophrenia, expanded my understanding of mental illness in a way that no third-person study or medical or mental health text could have done. The father-son relationship was, as a sub-text, one of the more emotionally touching, almost painful, aspects of the book.This unusual book does not fall into a catefory of any sort, and it is one of the best books I've ever read."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"This book taught me to &quot;pay attention when life goes awry.&quot; In some ways, this is a mysterious book because it is not so much fiction as it is the author's life.

And even about the psychological effects of branding in relation to the way that human 'tribes' (societies) bond. I think that Pirsig starts a discussion he can't close in a convincing way - though many fascinating ideas are introduced. I'm still completely fascinated by the idea and history of the 'MYTHOS' - a great follow up is watching some Adam Curtis documentaries on youtube! I RECOMMEND that to any Z.A.M.M. fan.Yes - I thought it provided more questions than answers - but isn't that the nature of inquiry in the very first place? The more we learn - the less we know? But really - it's those notions - those questions - those concepts that really opened up my mind. It's the amazing places that Pirsig himself can only hint at - and is only half aware of - which are the real reward for reading it. I can't recommend it enough - and I often do. I've lost about three copies I've given out as loaners - and I'm only here because I'm going to buy three more to give to deserving and receptive friends.

I have read it 3 times and want to read it again, a must must read book.I first read it by chance, when picked up from my office library before going out for my first solo motorcycle ride (on Royal Enfield) and thought it will give an insight about motorcycles. To be honest, it did. I prepared my list of must haves using references in the book. From a high level view, it appears that it tells you about maintaining a motorcycle, by someone who owned a motorcycle and spent time fiddling around with it.This book is not about motorcycles, it is about values. It is about inquiry in to values (title).It gave me whole new insight about how we perceive everything; our work, our relationships, our interests, our passion and our life.Then I read it twice in next 4 years at different phases of my life and career. It helped me emotionally and professionally. Not because, this books teaches you something. It forces you to think, inquire about yourself and what you want to be.Pirsig makes a lot of amazing points throughout the book.

Since we were well before a simple Wikipedia search, it would be years before I would hear most of their names again. What I do remember very clearly is that when I emerged from my room I knew I was going to college to become a Mechanical Engineer. I had long since forgotten why I came to that conclusion until I relived my young experience on page 176 just a few days ago. It was my third reading of this great book.My second reading came in 1992, I was 28. In those days I was brash, arrogant, and full of gumption, as Pirsig would call it. I knew a lot more about philosophy and theology and engineering then I did my first time through. I also owned a motorcycle and had completed an active duty tour in the military. I was working as a systems engineer for the DoD and was in school working on my second Master's degree. The book still made sense... a lot of sense. At that point I knew it had nothing to do with Zen and even less to do with motorcycle maintenance, but Pirsig has always told us that up front.Fast forward sixteen years...a family, a company, a new career, a fresh read. Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance is still every bit the masterpiece it was back in 1974. But then what is it about - if it's not about Zen or art of motorcycle maintenance? Certainly much has been written over the past four decades attempting to define exactly what Pirsig was trying to tell us. No need for that. Read the book, Pirsig will tell you. No matter what you may hear, no matter what you may think, this book defines for us that which can never be expressed through words and rational thought alone. It must be experienced.

Using a cross-country motorcycle trip as a backdrop, Pirsig considers the essence...and limits...of science and compares the field to that of philosophy in broad terms.More than anything else, this book's unique value centers on the questions and perspectives it opens up. While readers can benefit from Pirsig's view on the scientific method, for example, the real \\"learning\\" in this publication is that the seemingly disparate viewpoints of art and science can be united in a purposeful and useful manner.This publication enjoys an enduring following and offers much to readers with an interest in learning about philosophy in an applied...and engaging...manner."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"This is one of the hardest books I have ever read. I decided to pick it up after seeing one of Fitch's pre-fight interviews before his fight with George St. Pierre for the Welterweight Championship. Jon Fitch said this is the book that helped him become such a successful MMA fighter in the UFC.After Jon tied the UFC record for victories in a row with 8, I wondered how this book could be so influential. In the book as in many martial arts the focus is on quality instead of winning. The analogy of climbing the mountain and enjoying the view along the way up and not just at the top was very easy for me to understand, and relatable to training for a fight.There is a lot of philosophy and Zen in this book and having never studied philosophy in school this was my first exposure to both topics. There are a lot of difficult concepts in this book and I put it down many, many times because it provoked so much introspective though for me. The story of Pirsig's trip across the country with his son was a great way to approach many of these more complicated philosophical topics.While it did take me over a year to read the book due to putting it down so much I'm glad I finished it. Reading this book opened up my mind to many new ways of thinking about things."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"This book is quite a shattering self-analysis as well as a very painful and thought-provoking book.

You become your own best friend.As the author moves onto the philosophy of life and being, he has done some serious introspective. So much so that he has become at times delusional and out of step with society, which he blames for many of the problems that he is facing as well as others on this path.One has to agree with the author that our western society has made it almost impossible for one to follow his/her own path. There are so many distractions along the way, which makes it easy for one to falter. This is one good reason that many have turned to the eastern religions for a more balanced spirit.The author moves forward with the help of his son Chris."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"While \\"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance\\" has been criticized as mushy philosophy, it is still a great read, and it justly deserves its ongoing cult following. In the 21st century, we've grown accustomed to trash goods and services: corrupt corporations and politicians; shoddy consumer goods; diminishing or disappearing service. \\"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance\\" still provides at least a psychological antidote -- viz, a benchmark for quality."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"The other night I was watching a discussion about outstanding people and events of the Second Millennium. The panel seemed to agree that the Apollo 11 Moon Landing was, beyond a doubt, the outstanding event of the Second Millennium. At that point in the discussion, I recalled a book that I had read over 20 years ago - none other than ZAAMM!I re-read the book and, sure enough, on page 170-171 of the hardcover, is his discussion of the significance of the Columbus Voyage. The Columbus discovery of a new world had &quot;...just shook people up.&quot; &quot;The whole Renaissance is supposed to have resulted from the topsy-turvy feeling caused by Columbus' discovery of a new world.&quot; The discovery had presented a new paradigm so powerful that &quot;The only way that they could assimilate it was to abandon the entire medieval outlook and enter into a new expansion of reason.&quot;The Apollo 11 landing did'nt involve a paradign switch for us in that the &quot;Moon exploration doesn't involve real root expansion of thought...It's really just a branch of what Columbus did. A really new exploration, one that would look to us today the way the world looked to Columbus, would have to be in an entirely new direction.&quot;Thanks, Robert, for giving a little order to these topsy-turvy times.

Is it the character of the book, or is it the Author himself? Or, again, a weird cross of the two?Leaving aside this last question which, I admit, is rather academic, we're brought by the author in the labyrinthic mazes of a new philosophy while it is being built, and the process is a most fascinating one.We see how this huge work is accomplished through trials and errors, and we're struck by how plausible it all seems. Indeed, at the end of the book, it is difficult not to use what we learnt by it in our everyday experience. It is a book whose message will be with the readers for the rest of their lives.I myself felt as if I had opened my eyes, after reading it. Again, it is a literary work that widens our views on the world thus allowing us to rethink our lives in its brilliant light.Motorcycle maintenance is just an example depicted in the book (together with many others).After that, the reader can apply what he learnt to Life Manitenance.In a word?Illuminating."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"A couple of years ago, an editor (whom I had hired to help give my book \\"A Reason for Living\\" a final polish before publication) wrote to me a heartening letter of appreciation, the last part of which steered me very propitiously onto \\"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance,\\" by Robert M. Pirsig. The half autobiographical, half philosophical nature of my book apparently reminded him of Mr. Pirsig's work. Now that I have read this remarkable work, I see the connection, both at the level of style and content, and confessedly delight in it. There is hope after all for a book that daringly challenges mainstream literary categories or straddles two of them by blending a personal epic with extensive philosophical insights.What above all took a firm hold on my attention is the author's perspective of the nature of reality; that is, our human reality, which is the only one to which we have access. His entire discourse about Quality - as the very core of our lives that bridges the divide between art and science - is definitely on target, smack in the middle. It scores all the more points with me as I myself buck at every materialistic worldview that is blind to its spiritual foundation.By spiritual foundation I mean the human spirit behind every human endeavor, including scientific ones. In fact, reality as we know it is nothing but a spiritual reality, again in the sense that it is all happening between our two ears in the form of sensations and thoughts, and that it is suffused with feelings and value judgments that constitute the heart of the matter. Furthermore, strictly speaking, reality as we know it is nothing but the spiritual reality peculiar to each of us as individuals. The assumption that part of it (the part that concerns other people and things, distinguishable from ourselves) refers to a reality that exists independently of us is precisely that, an assumption, and a metaphysical one to boot, if also reasonable. A less reasonable assumption would be that other people and things, distinguishable from ourselves, are an illusion, a dream or a nightmare depending on how we look at it - a mere extension of ourselves that proceeds from some mysterious principle that inheres in our spirits.Needless to say, the assumption that the world reasonably distinguished from ourselves can be limited to our perception of it or can amount to a \\"material\\" aggregate of microscopic things is not only metaphysical in the extreme; it is laughably fantastical or at least indefensibly presumptuous and narrow. Indeed, the idea that something can be exclusively \\"material,\\" when our reality is exclusively spiritual, is bordering on the insane for it is devoid of a rational basis. I would go so far as to say that our scientific culture, chockablock of \\"material\\" descriptions that are supposed to reveal the alpha and omega of the universe, is fit for the loony bin (this point is particularly ironic because it is also made by Mr. Pirsig, who spent considerable time at the asylum, as though it were him whose mind was derailed). The word \\"material\\" simply refers to the world of appearances, and any person endowed with common sense knows that appearances are superficial and can be deceiving, or that people - us included - and things far exceed them. Quite frankly, so-called primitive cultures that indulged in a nave form of animism were certainly closer to the truth than those among scientists who are so intellectually blinkered that they believe there is nothing more to the world than meets the eye.Yes, as the author of \\"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance\\" eloquently and vehemently points out, it is high time that we wake up from our materialistic slumber and acknowledge the true essence of humanity - and in all likelihood of the universe as a whole: the spirit, driven by feelings and value judgments. Not that we should plunge headlong in the opposite extreme and adopt an anthropomorphic worldview, but that we should remain open to the part of the world that is beyond appearances, beyond the so-called matter, and cannot be experienced but only imagined. Scientists are doomed to stay miserably off the mark, however efficient their material descriptions and predictions may be, until they agree to be poets as well.Laurent Grenier"},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"I first encountered this book in a university education class a few years after it was released. For some reason, &quot;Zen&quot; was on the required reading list for we aspiring teachers and we all wondered why until we read the book. This book introduced us to the worlds of philosophy, chatauquas, as well as the basic workings of a motorcycle. Pirsig takes us on simultaneous journeys--one across the United States with his son Chris, another as he pursues a higher education of the mind, and lastly one he takes with his son to discover each other for the very first time.I found the chapter where he examines the idea of Quality with his students to be readily applicable to my own interest in being a teacher. Also, the travel journal parts of the story areenjoyable in the same way as another traveler's writing--William Least-Heat Moon's &quot;Blue Highways.&quot;The book is also a warning about the dangers of pursuing a life of the mind at the expense of human relationships and living in the real world. The coming together of the father and son at the book's close tells us all how precious and important relationships with our loved ones must come before all else.A great read twenty-seven years ago and still a classic one here in the twenty-first century."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"I am suprised at how many people that I have run into who have said that this book has changed their lives. Well, you can chalk up another changed life convert in me. After reading it eight times I lost track of the subsequent number of reads. It seems as if it just gets deeper and deeper with each read. My whole outlook on purpose and meaning in life has been slightly changed after thinking and pondering this book over the last three years; and in a good way. Take up the challenge of this book and see what all the fuss is about. I mean this book has its own online philosophy chat room/website dedicated to the real zealots of the cause!

Trying to describe the effect this book's had on me is useless... it's far too great, far too powerful, far too unbelievable to put into words.Perhaps I've read more into this book that was warranted... So be it. I fully realize that there are those out there who claim Pirsig is an unintelligible hack who got lucky, and others who aren't so vicious but who agree that Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenence is not what the &quot;hype&quot; said it was... but it doesn't matter. This book represents so many things to me. I _care_ about it. And I've learned to care about other things. Some would scoff at the use of the word &quot;care&quot; in this way, because they fall back on the easy to use and ultimately ridiculous view that such &quot;new age, baby boomer/twenty something spirituality&quot; is empty and fake. But I _care_ now, I understand Quality in all its infinite forms. This book has done so much for me....See? I even began this review by saying &quot;there's not much I can say,&quot; but Pirsig's book has drawn me in yet again.Read this book. Cherish this book. The two go hand in hand, so just do the former first, and the latter will inevitable happen of its own accord."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"This book was recommended to me by a friend whose opinion I respect. For this reason I read all the way to the end feeling all the way like I was flogging a dead philosophy. There were a few illuminating moments, but very few and not enough to justify the rapturous treatment given to it by my friend and other reviewers.Obviously, the rapturous readers are getting something from the book of value and that is great. Now you've had just a hint of the real thing, you'll be blown away when you start reading books written by those with a more masterful approach. For those interested in the philosophy of science touched on by Mr Pirsig try &quot;The Matter Myth&quot; by physicist Paul Davies, just in case you thought all scientists were beholden to logical positivism or naive scientism. Try &quot;Marriage of Sense and Sensibility&quot; by Ken Wilber if you want to see the world only marginally hinted at by Mr Pirsig with his concept of Quality.And never trust authors who seek authority for their pet ideas by Capitalising!"},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"Many, many people have recommended this book to me as &quot;life changing&quot; etc and there certainly is a big enough following to the book to hype it.There are some good ideas in this book: the ideas on quality versus quantity, some dialectic stuff, etc. However, all the ideas are kind of like ornaments on a Christmas tree. They're decorative and sparkle, but the tree they're hung on is drab and uninteresting. The novel never does much with these ideas other than toss them out at you like confetti.As a piece of fiction, there's not much of a story and I really didn't care much about the &quot;philosopher&quot; at the center of the book. He comes across like a windbag - repeating the same ideas at the drop of a hat.I suspect that anyone who comes to this book full of new-age angst will bring with them all the post-modern spirituality epiphanies they need and attribute them to reading this book. For the rest of us though, it would be better to either read a good fiction novel or purchase a serious book on philosophy."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"It is with much trepidation that I disagree with the clear majority of readers and at the risk of being considered &quot;a cynical drapchode&quot; (expression in previous review), I think this was one bad book. The book has two three subplots: (1) the author and his son take a motorcycle trip across America (2) the author inquires into the philosophical underpinnings of Western civilization (3) the author goes totally insane his career as a college professor goes into freefall and he must have his personality expunged by court-ordered electroshock treatment. The book is chocked full of whining narcissism and self-involvement. We, the readers, have to be subjected to the author's vendettas against faculty committees, rhapsodies about screws and washers and how they relate to philosophy, and his cutting remarks to and about his son whenever the poor child interrupts (as children often do)his book-length loveletter to himself. This book has been published and republished to continual oohing and ahhing and acclaim and it probably is the duty of every sentient human being to get a copy and read it with an open mind. That being said, I plowed through the second half more from a sense of duty than from any enjoyment, and I really couldn't care less whether the author lived or died."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"that in a couple years I'll rate it a five. I was first given this book by my uncle who was dying. Now, that probably made an impression. He gave me the book and I whizzed through it so that I could talk with him about it. We did. I found the book thought provoking and interesting at the time. Since returning to the book a couple of times since my original reading, I've found the book rewarding. There's so much more I wish I could talk to my uncle about concerning this book, but he's gone now. Ah well.This book can be enjoyed on a couple levels. One, it's semi-biographical. There's also a sci-fi edge to it. Obviously, pretentious blow-hards cling to it for... well... obvious reasons. The ideas in \\"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance\\" are profound and hopefully you'll think about them for a bit.\\"Lylia\\" (I think that's the name) is Zen's sequel. While it too has strong thought provoking segments, it is windy and not too interesting a story... unless you're into sailing I suppose.

I couldn't reconcile the two.I've never known anyone who was schizophrenic, but Pirsig's belief system echoes exactly what the reviewer was saying; something I would have catagorized as \\"grandiosity,\\" with no small amount of paranoia thrown into the mix.In any case -- should you decide to pursue this book -- know that the text is rambling and simplistic.I've read many of the reviews, and those people who were lost or somewhat depressed (or even mentally disturbed -- I'm not quite sure) seem to really enjoy the book. Those people who are basically happy with their lives and mentally \\"sound\\" are dismayed and (somewhat) disgusted with the book.I'm not disgusted with the book, but with people who recommend it blindly to others."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"As required reading for our philosophy class our teacher assigned us Zen... However, he failed to tell us how boring and unelightening the book actually was.

I don't recommend this book at all."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"This is by far the worst book I have ever read (even worse than the Tao of Pooh). I have devoted my life to reading all different kinds of philosophy books and usually withhold judgment because I am not ashamed to admit that I am uncertain and confused about the most important questions in life. However, one thing I CAN say with certainty is that this book is garbage. True, it does present some basic, central concepts of philosophy in an accessible way that would appeal to readers who don't know much about philosophy. In fact, Persig brings up points that I wish more people would consider. However, this book has destroyed lives, or more accurately, people influenced by this book have destroyed lives, and the author is a very bad person (I don't know him personally). I intend to write a more detailed review in the future of how exactly this book has destroyed lives. For now, I recommend reading the 6 pages of one-star reviews written here by other readers, including ones who are apparently educated in philosophy. Only the first page of these appears in the Amazon window, so be sure to click the links to pages 2-6.Just the title is enough to make one suspicious. This book has almost nothing to do with Zen, as the author himself has admitted. The title is just a catchy marketing gimmick capitalizing on the exotic appeal of Zen. Read Routledge guides or something similar to understand Hume, Kant, etc. Don't contribute to the pocketbook of this evil author."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"I don't really care for chatty writers, and Pirsig likes to palaver on like it's nobody's business. Just get to the point and back it up with facts. The first time I read Zen was when I was teaching college at the time it was published. There was a lot of buzz going around about the book. Some profs were assigning Zen to their students, while almost everyone was praising it as the book of the century. So I had to read it. It didn't live up to the hype. There's nothing really deep or novel here unless you're a fan of syncretism, in this case the meshing of Eastern thought with Western thought. It's my view that both are mutually exclusive, and that any attempt to combine them dilutes both of them. But I'm biased. I'll take the Greeks, Augustine, Aquinas and the rest of the Western tradition any day."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"There are some good reviews already about why this is a bad book, I'll add my vote to that column. It being such a best selling book and supposedly about zen (see title, Zen and the Art...) I came into the book excited. It started out interesting but became tedious.He goes on and on about motercycle maintenence as if his goal was to bore the reader (which he succeeds quite admirably at). The way he talks also grows old fast, very self concious which he might be doing to show he has psychological problems, but it doesn't work. It reminds me of the way a high schooler would talk who is perhaps a little clever, but certainly not up to the task of writing a book. It's a little like the book \\"A Work of Hearbreaking Genius\\" which sucked even more than this book.There are some interesting thoughts in the book but it's overwhelmed by the trash.

I finally gave to book a real try on a lazy saturday Afternoon and found that the book truley is not about motorcycles but about a man's search for himself, about the difference in understanding, about what is real, about what is truth. While many say it is a book about philosophy and some look to it for this insight, I found that it is really a book about finding one's own understanding of the world.

I had been reading a lot of philosophy the way my father had before he became a minister, like it is taught in college. Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance was the perfect focus for the complaint that any philosophy can only be a way of trying to graduate carbon copies of someone.

Not only do the nameless narrator's encounters with his son Chris, his former self Phaedrus, and his neighbors John and Sylvia teach this, but also his chataqua, &quot;an-old time series of popular talks intended to edify and entertain, improve the mind and bring culture and enlightenment to the ears and thoughts of the hearer.&quot; Neither half of the book (story and chataqua) would be complete without the other.

A profound book that is enjoyable to read.This extraordinary book works on many levels. 1) Pirsig traces the split between Eastern and Western philosophy (and, by extension, religion) to the misunderstandings of a rational, linear Aristotle in interpreting the great mystic Plato. (An original idea I've never encountered in any book, philosophical or otherwise). 2) He provides the non-philosophically inclined reader with insight into Plato's greatness (and why Plato is revered to this day). 3) He connects Plato with the Transcendent (&quot;the One&quot;) and then provides a basis to begin understanding eastern philosophy and what is wrong with the western philosophical tradition. 4) He offers insights into life and the ills of our present society in an entertaining fashion.He also tells a nice story about a journey he takes with his son, and his struggle to reach some profound intellectual conclusions about life.If there is anything to be said negatively--and having read the book three times for enjoyment I am loath to say anything negative--it is that in writing for dramatic impact, some points are not explained in sufficient detail for readers encountering philosophical ideas for the first time, and they may miss the importance of his ideas altogether (as some of these other reviews might suggest)."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"i didn't know that this was biography until i finished it; thought it was one of the best novels i'd ever read. chasing a ghost and talks on philosophy are juxtaposed. the ghost story is especially fascinating. what a shock to realize it had really happened! have not bothered to go over his beliefs with a fine tooth critical comb but that's ok with me. i enjoyed his insights and found it riveting to watch him trace his thinking back to its origins. i have reread this book over the years and it is still a favorite of mine."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"Mr. Pirsig has written a very thought-provoking book and I am glad his stand on quality and values (or the lack thereof in this society) was put into print. As I continued to read, however (and I did read the whole thing, by the way), his character became more and more scary. I don't think I would like to meet him because the picture in my mind was of Reverend Jim (from the old tv series &quot;Taxi&quot;) but only more bizarre and without a sense of humor. The book became increasingly ponderous and incoherent, sort of like the main character.

The whereabouts of that old copy are unknown, but the title of this strange book had stayed somewhere in the back of my mind. One day while surfing the net I type the title in my search engine and was amazed to find a small following for this book. As I read the web page I became more and more intrigued. I decided to order a copy to see what in the world it was all about. Well, after reading the book I found it was not the &quot;biker&quot; book I expected it to be, rather a strange oddesy of a man and his son travelling across the country. I must admit that I was uterly lost at many po! ints throughout this novel, however, I don't think I will look at life the same way any more.

I find that books in which the author revels in his intellectual superiority to me leave me cold. Of course, there are lots of people who profess to liking this book because it it seems to coat them with a veneer of intellectuality. My mother calls that 'putting on airs'.

Personally, I couldn't get thru the entire novel. At pg 248, I just gave up. Phaedrus' rants about &quot;Quality&quot; are just horrible. It does give some good insights, no doubt about that; however, the author seems to take odd paths and use the novel with some propaganda means as well. (for ex. Sylvia and John need technology but can't work with it/understand it). This novel is different from others I have read, but a good read if you're up to the challenge. I would say give it a try up to 150 pgs. if you don't like it after that, then quit because you're not going to like the rest of the novel at all."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"I have only gotten thru half of the book---perhaps I should hold off my rating till I finish it and then rate it."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"I found the pace very uneven and the author seemed lost much of the time.

When I first read _ZaMM_ I was crushed that such a good title had been wasted. It contains neither Zen nor motorcycle maintenance. The title was designed to sell in surburbia. And for some unknown, &quot;emporer's new clothes&quot; sort of reason, it does.The book drones on with successive street corner rants better contained in a tome entitled _Sometimes I Feel Like a Nut, Sometimes I Don't_. I know Quality (one rant which dragged on for what seemed like nearly a thousand pages) when I read it... and this ain't it. At the time I read it, I *had* Zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance going with my motorcycle. &quot;&lt;Profanity&gt;,&quot; I thought, &quot;I can write a better book on the subject than that.&quot; (And there are many folks who think I did.)"},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"I'm sorry, I just don't get it. I think this book is over rated. Maybe if I read the whole thing it would have changed the way I think and feel about my life, but after forcing myself through of the book I said \\"that's all I can stands I can't stands no more.\\" This book isn't about Zen or motorcycle maintenance, it's about a guy on a motorcycle trip with his son trying to find the truth about his life. Just too much philosophizing for me."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"This exploration of metaphysical values is astute, pellucid and intriguingly interwoven with a semi-fictional construct that takes a catastrophic turn with the afterword information that the author's son / protagonist was murdered five years after the book appeared. Philosophically, the book is a calm, plain-spoken assault on Western concepts of rationality and subject-object dialectic. (Of course, to make the process complete, we should also have a non-rational but equally effective assault on non-Western synthesizing and holistic metaphysics.) I listened to this as an audiobook, which I think was an effective way to assimilate what otherwise might be tedious philosophic discourses."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"The book was in perfect condition and luckily I got it with enough time that I could read it for my class."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"The book was described as in 'good' condition but I found it to be in fair/poor condition.. very tattered, however, readable. the owners were very nice to deal with when I told them my query and even offered to refund the cost. That was not necessary and the book is being read, just would have appreciated a more accurate description. there was no image to go by either."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance is the most challenging book I've ever read. It's not one I would have chosen on my own, nor is it like any other I've ever picked up. The characters are not developed, yet they don't need to be. Ideas are expanded upon in great depth, but from angles that have never crossed my mind. The story jumps from novel to Chautauqua, and back again. The novel-like parts follow a boy and his father on a cross country motorcycle journey, while at the same time the Chautauqua becomes a battle between one man and the distant memory of another, seemingly fighting for the same body. Somehow the two-novel and Chautauqua-fit together.My feelings on this book are mixed. I can't decide if I like it. A few times I'd enjoy delving deeper into this \\"insane\\" man's mind, while most of the time I'd be ready to bang my head against a wall and set the book on fire. Many of the thoughts that at first intrigued me got analyzed to death, making it difficult to continue. However, in spite of struggling through the difficult and boring parts that appeared so often, I'm actually somewhat proud of myself for reading this. Parts of it made me think; I even found myself questioning subjects that arose.I'm not sure if I should recommend this book. I don't want to be responsible for someone going insane, yet many other books will seem like a piece of cake after reading Zen. Without the novel parts to ease my mind, I would not have been able to make it through this whole book and still be sane. It is extremely repetitive and if I never hear the words Quality or rationality again I think I'll be very grateful."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"Even though this book rambles at times and is often confusing and dull, it still brings up some intriguing points. I found the discussion of Quality to be interesting at times, but it eventually got repetitive. I also thought that Pirsig's discussion of so many different philosophies was insightful and thought provoking. This book even made me analyze my own life at times.Nevertheless, in terms of enjoyment, this book definitely falls short. About half way through, Pirsig's thoughts get so in-depth and specific that they are almost impossible to follow. This amount of detail almost forces the reader to lose interest very quickly. In addition, practically the entire book is a discussion of Quality, theories, and philosophies. This leads to almost no plot whatsoever. The lack of physical events actually occurring in this book failed to grab my attention.Overall, I thought this book had some good points and a good message, but these points were to few and to spread out to make up for the rest of the books flaws."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"I saw a man pursuing the horizon;Round and round they sped.I was disturbed at this;I accosted the man.&quot;It is futile,&quot; I said,&quot;You can never -&quot;&quot;You lie,&quot; he cried,And ran on.--Stephen Crane"},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"This book is a must read.

Below is my own version, not like the book but I aint no Pirsig and I do not apologize for this fact.Enjoy the book, wipe the philosophy from your feet and then relax with another good book. I'd recommend my autobiography published on Amazon.com Kind RegardsIt was around 1971/72 that I first discovered an alternative to how to determine if your motorcycle had spark or not. I credit my brother Charles Chadwick with this revelation and I will soon explain. This was in the days of Nixon's Watergate, Hunter S Thompsons prime, Dark Side of the Moon's debut and me learning once again that my brother cared so much about me as to teach me to trust no one.I had been riding bikes for awhile and being a child of nine/ten I cant blame myself for being ignorant of the workings of a two stroke internal combustion engine. I knew how the method of testing for spark if your bike would not start, just take the plug out lay it on the head and kick her over, you see spark you have spark.Good ole Chuckles ever mindful of my education taught me a shocking method of discovery.This was along time ago so patience please, my bike would not start, I did everything I knew mechanically to diagnose the problem. The bike had gas, the fuel petcock was turned to the on position. I checked for spark...nothing. Chuck came to my rescue and started to work on my bike kick it over and over as if it could be flooded, mumbled a number of ridiculous hypothesis why my bike would not start, then I should have recognized that dreadful glint of discovery in his eyes, he had a solution. \\"Josh hold onto the plug while I kick it over I need to check something\\"...Although my last Doctors visit did not indicate I am in imminent peril of going into cardiac arrest , I learned from my beloved brother at the tender age of nineish what it must feel like when you hear from the cold distance a paramedic yell CLEAR! A shocking revelation, and a lesson well learned.Travel through time abit to 1976 and I am riding in North Carolina with me Da and my brother, we always visited in the summers and Christmas since this was where my grandparents lived. Always a good time and always a good story , if I could only remember them all. This year it was Christmas and me da had the state of the art Yamaha 1976 360 mono-shock motocross bike. Set him back a pretty penny, I agreed not to go to college so he could indulge himself. The bike was awesome! I being a prime example of neoteny could only ride the bike if someone would start it for me and then I would run along side it and jump on when I felt I could balance the beast. The thing was a brute but my god what a blast, I can still can feel the power and glee piled upon glee and...Where was I?...Yea North Carolina, me da, Chuckles (Charlie does not like this nickname, nor do I like being shocked by a live spark plug, paybacks) were out riding on public land, a big sand field really, I dunno, this was 1976 for crying out loud and lawyers/environmentalists had not gained a foothold on the proper methods to bleed us of our freedom to ride around and have fun. Me da took a break, gassed up his new 360 and then promptly could not start the thing. So being the father of my gene pool he naturally pulled the plug on the bike and laid it on the head to check for spark, which it did indeed have and the bike suddenly fired up, not in the traditional way but in the way when kicked over a bike reeking of gas and set a live spark to it will fire up... I missed all the excitement , the futile efforts of throwing sand on the burning pyre of sport , the profanity and the facial expressions, National Geographic cover worthy facial expressions one can imagine. I road back only to find that the nitrogen shock had exploded and it was pretty cool but not worth the price of admission me da assured me. We drug our bikes home that Christmas the blackened carcass of the 360 among them and listened to the truckers and the hip crowd with CB's make commentson the two bikes with the charred remains of something...My mom was a good sport , my da did not cry (at least in front of me) and for awhile ole Chuckles and myself had to share our bikes with Da."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance by Robert M. Pirsig gives a whole new definition to the phrase \\"deep thinking.\\" The observations, conclusions, and speculations recorded in this novel are quite thought-provoking, but to the non-philosophical mind often become monotonous. The author ponders numerous simple themes in unnecessarily complicated ways. There are two kinds of readers who read this book: those whose brains hurt from thinking too hard, and those whose brains just go numb and refuse to take in anymore complex nonsense. I was probably both of these at one point or another in this book. One could also argue that there is a third type of reader-one who takes in every little detail and enjoyably soaks in every statement. I personally think that these people are insane right along with the narrator. But for any type of reader, there are many lessons that can be learned from the author's experiences, insights, and mistakes.This story also gets the reader thinking about topics that a person would not typically think about. My initial response to the early chapters of the book was wonder and adventure, but then the tone of the book changed considerably. I often found myself having to read the same sentence several times in order to derive its meaning, and then once I understood the meaning, I was usually even more confused. The book does do a nice job of getting the reader into the mind of an insane person, and to understand how different minds think. The tone of the story was also very apparent, and the change in tone made lasting impressions on the reader. The novel, Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, can be compared to its title-it's long, it's confusing, and it leaves the reader saying \\"huh?\\""},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance is about a guy, Robert Persig, that goes on a motorcycle trip with his son, Chris. The purpose of the trip was for Robert to discover himself, to find out more about his past before he went insane. I had a very hard time reading this book, and I didn't really enjoy it either.This book was the hardest book I have ever had to read. This was because of Persig's rambling on of stupid, random thoughts and philosophies. Through out his trip he talks about many philosophies that will bore you to death. His great quest to find the meaning of Quality is unbelievably confusing and just plain stupid. After reading this book every time someone mentions the word Quality you will want to punch him/her in the face. He goes into such great detail about so many random thoughts and ideas that the book seems to never end.I am very proud of myself for actually reading this book in its entirety. I had such a hard time focusing and trying to understand this book and Persig's random thoughts that I dreaded having to even look at this book. I suggest reading through this horrible book so that from then on it will make you appreciate every other book that you read."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"This nonsense has to end now.Like many of you, a wild-eyed friend recommended this book to me. I had heard so many good things, I was stunned at how awful it was.The books ends with him sitting cross-legged and naked on the floor, catatonic, sitting in his own urine, with a cigarette burning down to his knuckles. His wife (wisely) calls the authorities to take him away and receive electroshock treatment. His son asks, \\"Were you insane?\\" He cries out, \\"No!\\" To his son, and to us.The entire book is an attempt to say that rather than being mentally ill, he is simply a free-thinker, and sees the world differently.Many, many readers pointed out how rambling the narrative is, and how illogical his reasoning is (and this from the ones who liked the book!) Other symptoms of his illness: anyone who disagreed with him had a secret motive, or they couldn't see the \\"truth.\\"He's absolutely furious at being forced to endure shock treatments and outraged at being labeled \\"insane,\\" but he was (at one time) severely mentally ill, and trying to deal with that. That's HIS journey. Yours is not to get caught up in the \\"depth\\" of this book as if it means anything. It doesn't.Do NOT follow a madman, do NOT support his illness by buying or recommending this book, and please, please, take a moment to feel sorry for his traumatized son."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"I read this for my book club - and if it weren't for this I would have given up after struggling through the first 100 pages. Some people seem to really like this book. I just didn't get it. The meaning of &quot;quality&quot;? Enough already!! I feel like I just read a book about the meaning of &quot;the&quot;. I'm the dummy though, for not following my instincts and putting it down after the first 100 pages. Hey - for those of you that really liked this book - I know of a bridge here in Brooklyn for sale...."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"I read the first half of the book with rapt attention, but when Pirsig starts to call Tao &quot;quality&quot; he is way off. Taoism has absolutely nothing to do with quality, it is literally translated as &quot;The Way.&quot; It is roughly equivalent to Zen, which means &quot;Meditation.&quot; Tao is undefinable in words, but if I had to I certainly would not describe it with such a capitalistic word. If anything, Tao is mindfulness, being in the present moment rather than in the past or future. I suppose back when the book was written there were not many good Eastern translations for Pirsig to imitate? By today's standards, his thoughts seem rather shallow and trite."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"Don't believe the hype. The whole premise that \\"Quality\\" is an undefineable thing is ridiculous, and the whole rest of the book is built on that flawed premise. A huge disappointment after hearing so many wonderful things about the book."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"I don't get it. All of this praise for a book with a misogynistic, selfish a-hole for a main character? A road trip with your child is something to be savored between the two; yet I remember reading only two or three conversations between them. Granted, it's difficult to talk while riding a motorcycle, but you have to get off of it sometimes.And one of the few conversations is when Chris is told people are saying that he has mental/emotional problems. When you think of everything the poor kid had to go through with that nutcase of a father, I don't think Chris is the one with the problems.The book is not about philosophy; it's the rantings of a schizzo whose parenting skills make Joan Crawford look like June Cleaver."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"This book is about a man's journey on a motorcycle. He goes through his past experiences and many of his obstacles. Many of these obstacles are questions he has about different theories, philosophies, and underlying forms. This book to me was something if had the choice, I never would have read.One of the most common thoughts Pirsig wrote on and on and on about was quality. Seems pretty simple of a thought doesn't it? Not to him. He analyzed this thought so much that it couldn't make sense to anyone. After all this examining he then decides to tell us that everything he has said about quality is wrong and should be forgotten. This especially made me mad thinking why did he right a book and make others go through that too when it was all nonsense anyways.This book takes you through Pirsig's sad life. He doesn't feel and he doesn't do anything but try to analyze different things. Maybe if he would step back for a second, he would see the real answer. Maybe he would actually start to enjoy life."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"For years I have talked to people who told me that this book changed their lives. Looking for enlightenment, I read it a couple of times and finally realized that there is nothing in it that a thoughtful ten-year old could not come up with. The book has long been overrated. For those of you whose lives have been changed by reading it, try something like Nietze or even Karl Marx and get ready."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"You would think a book about motorcycle maintenance and zen would be a very down to earth kind of read but a huge majority of the book is spent on philosophic meanderings and metaphysical mysticism. As many people have said the ideas in this book aren't exactly new these days but that's not the author's fault since he wrote it over 30 years ago. The problem is that he's taken very simple concepts and made them ridiculously complex.In contrast to this book, pick up something by the Dalai Lama about buddhism. I find it very ironic that while the spiritual leader of Tibet can explain a concept so simply, some guy on a motorcycle wants to tell me about how a dead greek guy's ideas relate to an undefined term called 'quality' that comes before everything else.It's just disappointing to me because I was hoping to hear a lot more about motorcycles and how they relate to life and zen but he completely forgets about the bike about a third of the way into the book."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"I didn't read this book when it first came out to rave reviews. Something about all that enthusiasm with no substance behind it made me wary, and rightly so, it seems.The narrator is a condescending, pompous egotist and I pity his son and his long-suffering friends who got dragged along into this anti-climactic non-dark non-heart of non-darkness."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"I bought this book because it was required by my English lit teacher!! Required reading!! Anyways, I didn't enjoy this book at all. Not my type, definitely.But if you are interested in reading this book, just remember, this is one book that you can judge by its cover. It's about exactly what the title indicates. Kind of a novel/bio about a man who gets into motorcycles and becomes philosophical about them. A little bit creepy, not too interesting and even some steamy scenes.Weird...and not worth my time."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"A good friend raved to me about the book.

Trying to get at the very essence of what life is, and what being alive is, a man and his son travel across the countryside on a motorcycle. The man trying to teach his malcontent son to live life in the moment. Ultimately they do work through thier problems, but still something remains unresolved. The lessons in this book are many but ultimately it, the book, questions wether quality is real or imagined. Trying to break down to get at the quality by reduction of the smaller and smaller theory ,you soon run out of smaller parts ,and may be left thinking ok where was the quality. The point being, that the quality of something is all of the big and small parts, and the space inbetween. In todays world of, empty products with no paticular specialness, this book may mean more now than ever. Pirsig, I think was getting at the fact that the farther you dig into something, the deeper you go, the less you find, its only what you make of it in your own mind, ultimately its much ado about nothing."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"\\"You see things vacationing on a motorcycle in a way that is completely different from any other.\\" Ahhh, such is an example of the understated writing of Mr. Pirsig. As a long-distance motorcycle rider myself and a person who has rode motorcycles from coast-to-coast several times (and will be doing so again and again) I read this book with particular interest when it came out in the 70's and recently re-read it...and enjoyed it even more. It's one of the few books I have read more than once in my life. Of course the book is more a work of philosophy and the pursuit of \\"Quality\\" than about motorcycles. The story just happens to be set against the backdrop of a father and son cross-country motorcycle tour. This is a unique and thoughtful book in the world of popular writings. I highly recommend it. And it does not matter whether you are interested in motorcycles or not. If you are interested in \\"life\\" you will likely enjoy this read."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"This is a book suitable for the deepest thinker while at the same time opening the heart. It is worthy to be read many times. One of the best books Al has ever read."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"I decided to re-read this book now that I am older, have my own bike, know a little bit more about Buddhism, and (showing my non-Buddhist material side) wanted to convert a ragged paperback to a hardback for my permanent library. It was certainly better than the first time around, but my favorite quote is still right at the front of the book, \\"We want to make good time, but for us now this measured with emphasis on 'good' rather than 'time' and when you make a shift in emphasis the whole approach changes.\\" This is a book I can hopefully read many more times in my lifetime and an easy five star. This version was the 25th anniversary edition and has a new introduction from Pirsig."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"This book is truly amazing. It opens doors to questions that one never asks. For the days I spent reading this book I was lost in a daze of questions and thoughts which caused me to rethink everything I'd learned.Pirsig takes the reader through a beautiful chautauqa that concerns itself with the question of truth and quality. Pirsig takes the reader on an adventure as he goes on a motorcycle trip with his son across the states. As he develops the ideas of his former self, Phaedrus, (before he was treated for mental illness) he faces an internal struggle between his true self and the new identity he has been forced to adopt. Beautifully written, the book mixes Pirsig's philosophical queries with the story of his journey and leads the reader to amazing epiphanies and insights. The story makes you realize how learning has forced students to imitate what is taught, rather than using their own thoughts to come up with original material.A fascinating book, it seems to be one that everyone loves and many find life altering. Definetly a book to read again and again and again."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"This is one of those books where, after you are finished reading it: you are never the same. Its like pressing the &quot;refresh&quot; button for your mind. You feel so fresh after reading this book that words cannot express it.This book is not about motorcycle maintenance though! It is about life in general, positive things about life, a bit of philosophy, and good narrative about Montana.You have to be patient in reading this book. It is not for fast reading. Enjoy it slowly and steadily. Good Luck!"},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"Never has any book affected such life changing attitudes in myself.

Pirsig talks about the most common and fundamental aspects of human experience and understanding that, it just so happens, no one else is talking about. Why is it that nobody can say what Quality is, but everyone can pretty much agree as to what has it or lacks it; in other words, is it subjective or objective?Pirsig takes his dialectic-of-the-ages to an even more focused and broadly applied level in the sequel, &quot;Lila&quot;, which I could not help but notice, did not make the final Amazon.com 2.5-million-title cut. Catching this man's 40-ton metaphysical cleaver of rational thought upside the head will equip you with a drug-like feeling of total intellectual invulnerability that YOU want. Did I mention that I like the book?"},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"This book is the ultimate travelogue. It takes the reader on many different journeys: a motorcyle ride from the midwest to the Pacific coast, a philosophical ride from ancient Greece to modern America, a relationship ride between father and son, and a long slow descent into insanity. All woven together in one story. I have read this book at least ten times, each time starting out with a different journey in mind. I read it the first time because it covered much of the country I came from and I frankly skipped much of the philosophy. I then read it again with the philosophy riding shotgun. I think you can see where I am going here. Each time reading it I have had a different set of values and qualities that I was looking at. (I have even read it to see if I could determine what type of motorcycle was used for the journey.) As I grow older, and my perspective changes from know-it-all youth to confused parent and adult, each time I read this book (or even a section) I get something different out of it"},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"A thought provoking book which causes you to think about yourself and life. Best to be read in thirty page intervals for maximum comprehension and understanding. Some may have trouble understanding Pirsig's thoughts, writing and ideas.

A friend of mine recommended this book to me some years ago, telling me that the book was, for him, genuinely inspirational, a feeling that many other reviewers here appear to share. I read it carefully precisely because I care for my friend and wanted to understand him better. But I have to say, in all honesty, that this is one of the worst books I have ever read.It is not merely that it's pretentious and outlandish--plenty of &quot;philosophical&quot; books fall into those categories--but it is also monumentally boring. It achieves a degree of boringness that remains unmatched by any other book I have read, and I think that if I can honestly boast about anything, I can boast about the number and variety of books I have read. I've read long books, short books, scholarly books, schlocky books, comic books, cookbooks, mystery novels, fantasy novels--you name it, this beats them all in the boredom category. After reading page after interminable page about a meaningless motorcycle drive across Montana and God knows how many other interminable states, interspersed with prurient glimpses into a decaying psyche that winds up imploding in a most anti-climactic way, one begins to count the pages to the end with every page turn.As a teacher of philosophy I was dismayed to find that many people who claim to be interested in philosophy found this book to be an effective introduction to the topic. It is perhaps no accident that the people who tell me that this was the first &quot;philosophy&quot; book they read, and that it was foundational for them, turn out to be among the least philosophical people I know. Indeed, many of them appear to be ineducable in the subject, a property that I ascribe to having used this book as their introduction to the subject.I appear to be in the minority in this view, however. I suppose that I must be some sort of philistine or something, but I can find nothing of value here, either philosophically, spiritually, or psychologically. And I still know nothing about maintaining a motorcycle."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"Unfortunately, I have to agree with the previous writer here, Scott Carson, in his much more detailed review, that this book just didn't live up to its reputation. At the risk of criticizing one of the most legendary books of the metaphysically itinerant, agoraphobic, and spiritually questing 60s, I just didn't find it to be particularly deep, although it is sometimes entertaining and I did learn a few things here and there. But I'd heard about how profound the book was and about all the deep philosophy in it, but really, it doesn't even get to the level of your typical college Philosophy 1A class. As an introduction to Zen there are some occasionally interesting tidbits, but here too, the actual philosophy is pretty light.I'm sure this book did literally affect and change the lives of millions of people who read it and thought it was great, but then, they probably weren't that well read in philosophy so it was all new. That's fine, there's value in educating the general public on matters metaphysical and on basic philosophy and also eastern philosophy and Zen. If the book did that in some people's minds, then my hat's off to Pirsig, but I personally found it to be pretty thin gruel considering the book's amazingly stellar reputation. I give the book 3 stars for its historical importance and for its being one of the most important literary icons of the period, and also for effort, but really, that's being generous.If you want to read a better book on eastern philosophy, I would recommend you try Alan Watts's The Book: On the Taboo Against Knowing Who You Are. I never gave Watts his full due of respect back in the 60's and 70's, because at the time I saw him as a trendy popularizer perhaps cashing in on the interest of that segment of the western readership who are perennially eastern-obsessed and therefore too naive and uncritical of their philosophy. Back then, there were just too many young people, who, having rejected whatever western culture they were brought up in, simply accepted, lock, stock, and barrel, Tao, Vedanta, and/or Buddhism after having read one or two books and therefore having finally discovered \\"the truth.\\"Well, looking back, that's perhaps too harsh an assessment, and I will say that Watts's book is an extremely well-written, concise, and clear introduction to Vedantic thought that is as relevant today as it was 35 years ago. I recently picked up the book after 30 years, and found that in many ways I enjoyed it even more than I did back then.As others have commented more completely on the usefulness and relevance of the philosophy in the book, I will just mention one thing. I really enjoyed his discussion about the fear of death. Watts points out that the way western culture deals practically and philosophically with death, isolating the individual from feeling a part of the universe as a whole on the one hand, and as basically a taboo subject, on the other, is unproductive and ultimately does nothing to resolve the issue. He points out that the denial process of sweeping it under the rug only makes it worse, and that ultimately the only solution is to just face one's fear. If death frightens you or makes you afraid, well then, be afraid. At least be honest about it, because that's the first step to realistically starting to deal with the problem.The reality is, that no matter how certain one is of one's religion, no-one truly knows if there is an afterlife. It is possible that all these beliefs simply represent a wishful-thinking and wish-fulfillment response to a realistic fear--the fear of death. Until one admits that and confronts the issue head on, it will continue to haunt you despite your most cherished beliefs to the contrary."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"ZAMM is a quirky book that has some interesting things to say, but it is certainly no masterwork, and those who believe it is are sadly misguided people for whom one can only feel a certain amount of pity. Those who are the objects of that pity do not care for it, of course, but a man can't help how he feels. Perhaps having been written by a mentally unstable author, ZAMM has attracted more than its fair share of mentally unstable believers -- or perhaps they are the usual crowd of lost souls who will follow anything that moves, anything that can be taken for a plausible Messiah. I have nothing particular against the mentally unstable, you understand, I just don't want to receive philosophical instruction from them. Especially when it comes in this form, and I quote: &quot;But there it was, the whole history of science, a clear story of continuously new and changing explanations of old facts. The time spans of permanence seemed completely random he could see no order in them. Some scientific truths seemed to last for centuries, others for less than a year. Scientific truth was not dogma, good for eternity, but a temporal quantitative entity that could be studied like anything else. &quot; This is just specious nonsense through and through. The sort of thing that sounds wonderful when put across with a glib dead-pan delivery, but which has absolutely no truth about it. It is, in short, the kind of confused construction that comes from the mind of a man suffering a mental breakdown, and the sort of &quot;illumination&quot; that attracts similarly confused people. But at least ZAMM is not a deliberate and cynical confidence trick as so many publishing projects of this kind turn out to be. I believe that its author is sincere about what he comes up with, but sincerity does not equate with wisdom, nor even to expertise. As for the readership ... the sheep that follows other sheep must remain lost; people choosing to regard ZAMM as profound have not got to first base yet, which is the realization that there are no gurus who have the answers, that when it comes to real understanding one has to work through the problems oneself. Unfortunately even the signposts that Mr. Pirsig provides are misleading. A close examination of the text reveals little more substance than that which might be expected to impress a certain sort of young person reading psychology or philosophy at undergraduate level; it certainly didn't impress me as meriting the kind of praise that some have heaped upon it. What a person ought to know, at least if he or she wishes to understand the book world, is this: a great many best-selling books present false intellectual credentials, which are endorsed by publishers and critics, either cynically or unknowingly, so that what is whipped up is a small tornado of publicity which beyond a critical point can feed off itself. Large sums of money and stocks of kudos are generated in this process, and what arises is a situation like that which appears in the tale of the Emperor's New Clothes. No one with a valuable reputation dare tell the truth -- which is that the intellectual credentials are false -- for fear that he or she will be taken for a fool,or worse. Times change though, and yesterday's silly fashions are seen for what they are. There was a time, for example, when to have said, &quot;The books of Salman Rushdie are appalling drivel&quot; would have irreparably damaged the reputation of any self-respecting literatus, whereas now it is damaging @not to agree with that assertion. And beware concluding in this case that the survival of ZAMM in print for so long proves its essential truths. It's just that it enduringly appeals to a certain kind of confused middle-brow &quot;searcher after something&quot;, which of course is no endorsement of its quality at all. Why else is ZAMM not a great masterwork? Because (the unfortunate and much-discussed title aside) it promises rather more than it delivers; it does not provide much more than a few shallow excursions into the topics it purports to illuminate in a new way; it lacks rigor, and because of that reason alone it would be worse than useless. I would go so far as to say that its success is actually embarrassing to anyone interested in intellectual quality, because it shows how easy it is to blind with science, or at least pseudo-science. One last thing. Publishers are playing with fire when they print, &quot;This book will change the way you think.&quot; on the cover of any book, because there are always legions prepared to believe a statement like that, and that is probably because there are legions who want to change the way they think, finding (one assumes) that they regard the way they presently go about it as unsatisfactory. If you doubt this, ask yourself if you could ever bring yourself to believe every word, no matter how improbable, written in a book that contains the specious guarantee: &quot;Everything written in this book is true.&quot; Of course not, you may say. What a cheap and transparent trick that would be. Except that if you think about it for just a little while you will see that this has been the @actual story of western culture for at least the last two thousand years. My advice to you, ironic though it may sound, is this: never make men into gods, and whenever you start feeling lulled by the beguiling words of a guru, stand up and immediately start thinking for yourself, tough though it is. S. J. L."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"This book is interesting, but over-hyped. It attempts to answer two important questions:1. What is Quality? (What is meant by the terms good and bad? Are these terms objective or subjective?)2. How can we cope with the frustrations, monotonies, alienation and ugliness of technology and modern life?Pirsig's answer to the first question amounts to a refusal to answer the question. He argues that Quality is indefinable, that it is pre-intellectual awareness, that it is the source of all subjects and objects and therefore is neither subjective nor objective.The problem with this argument is that Quality is not reality; it is a term we use to evaluate reality. If Quality is everything, like the Tao or the Godhead, then everything has the same amount of quality because everything exists. If I want to rank two essays, one as having poor quality and one as having high quality, under his definition of quality this is impossible - or at the best, gives us no means for ranking them.Before I read this book, I had an instrumentalist view of quality. Given a certain purpose or characteristic, those things that achieve that purpose most effectively or have the most of that characteristic have high quality. Therefore there is no such thing as general Quality, only specific quality in reference to some given hierarchy of classification. Pirsig not only fails to disprove this conception of Quality, but even if he did his conception of Quality provides no lens to view the world any differently.His answer to the second question is good but not unique. His answer, as far as I can tell, is: Have the right attitude. Be patient, calm, and concentrate on the moment or the job at hand. Think about things logically, but also use your intuition. Be reflective and meditative about your life and your surroundings.All of those ideas are good - but none of them are insights. There was nothing I hadn't already heard, or couldn't have gotten from a pop culture psychology book or a primer on relaxation techniques and Buddhism."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"This book is great if you are on the edge of a great depression. If you want to spend some time on your own and investigate the innerworkings of your own mind, try giving a shot to ZaMM. The novel is about man taking a journey with his son and friends. However, the background of this journey is decorated with philosophical motifs, and the autobiographical nature of the novel gives the reader a chance to take a look at the background of the author. At some point throughout the book, philosophical approaches and definitions make the book very hard to read. At those times, leave the book aside and try reading it at some other time. I believe that the book is somehow about the second chances, thus give reading it a second try. It does WORTH the pain!!!!"},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"\\"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance\\" blew my mind when I read it as a freshman in college. Pirsig's infatuation with the so-called big questions is infectious. However... knowing what I know now, I can see that Pirsig's take on those questions is hopelessly muddled, at best. Also, I cannot see for the life of me what the book has to do with Zen.Philosophy at its best is about learning to think clearly, not getting tangled up in obscure, ultimately meaningless abstractions such as \\"quality.\\" If you really are interested in the subject, Roger Scruton's \\"Modern Philosophy\\" provides a fine (though challenging) introduction for the newcomer. If you take your cues from \\"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance\\", you will only end up confused.Even worse is how the book romanticizes mental illness as somehow a hallmark of genius, rather than the tragic loss that it is. There is nothing at all romantic about losing your mind in the supposed pursuit of enlightenment, especially since the \\"truths\\" that result are very unlikely to be truths at all. Pirsig is a case in point."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"I read and reread the paperback until the cover fell apart. Eventually the tape could no longer hold it together. The book started me on a lifelong journey, seeking Quality. Not bad for a simple book."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"I don't know if it was the timing of reading it, or the content of the book, but ZEN is a book that rang with me when I first read it over a decade ago, and still does every time I pick it up and read it to my AP Calculus classes. I had to read it 3 times. The first time was for the story of him and his son, the second as a philosophy primer and the third as a metaphysics. It was the first time that I ever read a book and really believed that the author just wanted me to think about what he was writing and not AGREE with what he was writing. I was allowed to think for myself, encouraged to think for myself as I read. It is the single most important book I have ever read in regards to my career as a teacher, and the messages about how we think and the way we perceive and learn are, I feel, so important that my classes need to see them and not just hear me talk about it. Its a tough read.....but so well worth it."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"This is a very good book for anyone who's sick and tired of scientists and positivists shoving their philosophy down everyone else's throats. Pirsig shows that rationality and scientific knowlege are not infallible, and that their world view is based upon many preconceptions about the world we live in juat as any other system of philosophy is. He takes about one hundred pages to begin getting to the point, but oince hed does, the book kept my attention. His argument of a tripartite metaphysics with quality as the first cause is very interesting, but ultimately unconvincing. Nevertheless, the process of the argument itself is somewhat enlightening. It's not as earth shattering as I was lead to beleive, but I was surprised by it; it's worth your time."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"The book is revolutionary and has a certain timelessness about it. It is revolutionary as it questions the very essence on which our systems and beliefs are founded. It articulates a very strong case for the so called 'out of box' thinking and very logically picks holes in our current methodology of instruction and analysis. I read the book for the first time as a student some ten years back, and have read it about 5 times ever since. As a teacher, I found the section on 'grades' particularly useful and enlightening. Pirsig's analysis of the shortcomings of the present educational system is very succinct and strikes at the very root of our way of thinking and analysis. The book makes a very strong case for a definitive paradigm shift that shall help us to face the challenges of the coming century. In a lot of ways, the book is philosophical and some passages tend to be very heavy. Readers are advised to also go through the very thoroughly researched and well written guidebook that was presented to me by one of my American friends when he heard me recite an entire passage from the book verbatim sitting in a bar!! 'The Turning Point' by Fritjof Capra also makes a very similar point but his approach is more matter of fact and 'historical', Pirsig's is intuitive and compellingly sincere. Take your time over it, skip the difficult passages at first go, finish it once and you are bound to get back to it again and again. Happy reading.

Pirsig had an insight into the Quality Relationship. Just as an eye cannot see itself, the Quality Relationship is very difficult to see because it is the means by which seeing (in the intellectual sense) takes place. Even the purest scientific truth passes into the mind of its discoverer on a rail established by the Quality Relationship. The implication is that all truth is personal and subjective, even widely accepted scientific truths. That acceptance exists in the minds of many individuals, each of whom is motivated to receive the information and judge it against scientific criteria. The motivation rests on the Quality Relationship, and that is strictly a personal value judgement of whatever the mind choses to examine. Since individuals possess the Quality Relationship, this philosophy places individuals above science (modern society seems to need some of that view). Pirsig's second work, Lila, examines what it means for larger social entities such as governments to possess their own Quality Relationships. The book is also the exquisitely told personal story of Pirsig's efforts to recover this insight after losing the memory of it to shock treatment. A beautiful book in all respects"},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"If you want to have a greater understanding of the world, the people in it, and why you spend time reading books, read this one"},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"Let me preface this review by saying that I am both a writer and a creative writing professor--which I state not out of self-indulgence but to try and explain the mindset I had coming to this book. To put another way, I try to live by the Pobert Pinsky motto: \\"Read the way a chef eats.\\" I also happen to be extremely interested in \\"eastern\\" philosophy. Recently, I assigned this book to my Honors students, and to prepare, I reread the book (which I hadn't touched in years). As I was reading it, I found myself having an extremely different reaction than last time. Something about it troubled me but I couldn't quite put my finger on it. To be clear, I have no problem with writers talking frankly about their own shortcomings (in this case, Pirsig's actions as a father, student, and friend).So I read quite a few reviews (both positive and negative) to try and sort out that feeling. The reviews weren't much help; some criticized Pirsig's treatment of his son whereas others praised what they took to be his honest depiction of his own troubled behavior.Then, finally, it hit me. The problem with this book isn't with the narrator, but the writer himself. Despite Pirsig's unquestionable intellect and education, he demonstrates a consistent inability to grasp the connotations of his own language and storytelling. Since much of the original text has been discussed ad nauseam, let me illustrate my point by examining the famous Afterword.First, Pirsig begins with, \\"This book has a lot to say about ancient Greek perspectives and their meaning but there is one perspective it misses.\\" Really, only one? The sheer arrogance of that statement baffles me, especially since its presence in the Afterword (NOT in the description of the road trip and self-critical detailing of Pirsig/Phaedrus's own psychological troubles) implies that Pirsig the author is completely unaware of it. Also in the Afterword, we have the details about someone close to Pirsig being murdered. I won't give spoilers but I found it odd that Pirsig tells us the assailants were \\"black.\\" Why tell us that? The obvious defense (\\"Well, because they were!\\") reflects a lack of appreciation for the connotations of language of which any writer (especially one like Pirsig) should be aware.Perhaps more telling, though, is the passage were Pirsig describes his wife being pregnant. The couple has decided to terminate the pregnancy but as they're discussing it one last time, Pirsig has a change of heart. Omitting only the spoiler, here's the Pirsig passage in its entirety: \\"I said, 'Wait. Stop. Something's wrong.' What it was, was unknown, but it was intense and I didn't want it to continue. It was a really frightening thing, which has since become clearer. It was the larger pattern of [name omitted], making itself known at last. We reversed our decision, and now realize what a catastrophe it would have been for us if we hadn't.\\"OK, what's missing there? Well, we know how Pirsig felt about the situation but he has completely left out how his wife responded. Did she agree? Did she feel it, too, or did Pirsig bully her into compliance over whether or not SHE would carry the would-be child to term? And before someone offers a rebuttal of, \\"Well, it's Pirsig's book, not her's!\\" I'd just refer back to my original point about connotation. Pirsig himself opened this can of worms. In this case, the \\"we\\" at the end of the passage seems like an afterthought; somehow, in such a pivotal passage detailing Pirsig's complex philosophy, he completely forgot to do what any good writer would do and give us a line or two of description on how his wife felt. That's just bad writing.To be clear, I am not implying that Pirsig is racist or sexist; I'm simply saying that as a creative writer, he seems rather unaware of the subconscious, psychological effect that his word choice and approach to storytelling have on the reader. That's the literary equivalent of the person who doesn't pick up on social cues in a conversation and I suspect that's why some readers experience an unsettling feeling when they read this book (or return to it, as I did).All that being said--yes, this book has some beautiful passages and insights, and it's worth reading. After much reflection, though, I think it would be an oversight to completely dismiss some possible troubles with Pirsig's writing style."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"Deep.

The most interesting parts are his stories about travelling by motorcycle and his teaching experiences at Bozeman university. In between these stories he develops a theory about quality as something that should be left undefined and this does not inspire me much. It's true that science does not tell us how to find the laws of nature but curiosity and intelligent guesswork go a long way. In my opinion there is no need to introduce some magical concept of quality that tells us how to pick the right scientific theories. What we think is right and what's wrong is probably partly cultural, partly genetically defined and makes us who we are and how we develop new scientific theories which are then tested using the scientific method."},{"Title":"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance","review":"Very Interesting Book.

Ms. White paints a remarkably vivid portrait of life in 19th century Turkey, from the luxurious sultan's palaces to the most squalid slums of Istanbul, and writes intelligently of the political turmoil of the period.Set in the ancient city \\"Stanbul\\" on the Bosphorus in the waning days of the Ottoman Empire, (1886), political intrigue, espionage and social upheaval are rife, even in the sultan's harem. \\"Young Turks,\\" a reformist and strongly nationalist group of men, forced the restoration of the constitution of 1876. This new generation of Ottoman political thinkers were convinced that the Empire would never be truly modernized until it had adopted a democratic government and a constitution rather than undiluted power in the hands of the sultan. Gathering secretly in Istanbul, then in exile in Europe, \\"these reformers propagandized against the governments of Ali Pasha then, when Ali died in 1871, against the increasingly autocratic rule of Sultan Abdulaziz.\\" There is a tremendous struggle taking place to find a middle ground between traditional values of the non-secular East and the very different, more progressive ways of the West.Meanwhile, the Ottoman defeat in the war of 1877 against Russia imposed an indemnity of $100,000,000 on the Turkish government. By 1881 the whole empire went into receivership. \\"The British, French, Dutch, German, Austrian and Italian creditors set up the Council of Administration of the Ottoman Public Debt and took control of certain revenues.\\" The nineteenth century came to an end with the Ottomans under the political and economic domination of European powers and the threat of Western domination is obvious during the period the \\"The Sultan's Seal\\" takes place.Kamil Pasha, our protagonist, is a magistrate in the new secular courts of Istanbul. He is extremely intelligent, a modern man with a good understanding of the foreign community as he had been educated in both England and Istanbul. When the naked body of an English woman is discovered floating in the Bosphorus in Pasha's district, he begins an investigation, making the acquaintanceship of the English ambassador's daughter, Sybil, in the process. The dead woman, a governess in the royal harem, was wearing a pendant inscribed with the tughra, or seal, of the sultan. Sybil, an independent and attractive young woman devoted to her ailing father, assists Kamil by contributing information she compiles through her connections in the royal harem.Kamil Pasha ties this case to an almost identical death that occurred eight years before when another palace governess was found murdered, wearing the same pendant, which cannot be reproduced without the approval of the palace.This is truly an unusual detective story filled with a wide range of fascinating characters set against a rich and mysterious backdrop that was Istanbul at the end of the nineteenth century.One of my favorite characters, Jaanan, is another independent and well educated woman, about the same age as Sybil. She is Turkish, and the niece of a respected jurist and scholar. Her story, filled with adventure and tragedy, ties in with the main plot and is every bit as interesting.Ms. White's writing is as sensuous as the shimmering harem silks and the waters of the Bosphorus she describes so eloquently. I really enjoyed this wonderful novel and highly recommend it.JANA"},{"Title":"The Sultan's Seal: A Novel","review":"A young Englishwoman's body is washed up on the shore of the Bosphorus, not far from Istanbul, setting of an investigation into her death. This murder mystery is set in the declining days of the Ottoman Empire in late 19th century. It paints a somewhat exotic, romantic picture of life in Istanbul which many readers will find intriguing. The story is reminiscent of books written in the early part of the 20th century (like those of Agatha Christie), full of genteel aristocrats (both English and Ottoman) and palatial residences. Yet the sensual female characters are clearly drawn with a contemporary pen. Readers will understand the origin of the expression \`young Turk'. We are shown a society where Muslims, Christians and Jews live and work in harmony. Whether things were truly this way under Ottoman rule, or this is how we prefer to imagine them is uncertain. The Victorians and Edwardians had their particular worldview the book is written with intentional adherence to their prejudices for atmospheric effect. In fact, tensions lurk beneath the placid surface of Ottoman society, as becomes clear at the end.Part of the story is recounted in flashback which makes it more disjointed than it needs to be. On the whole the book is about more than just the murder but also about the lives of the characters and their inter-relationships. I was disappointed by the many unresolved issues at the end. It is almost as if the novel was left incomplete. The author could have done a better job of tying up the lose ends in a final chapter."},{"Title":"The Sultan's Seal: A Novel","review":"In the exotic climate of 19th century Turkey, a European governess is found drowned; it is later determined that she has been murdered. The investigation falls to the local magistrate of the region, Kamil Pasha. After establishing the woman's identity, a governess in the Sultan's household, Mary Dixon, Kamil's task becomes decidedly more difficult, separating truth from falsehoods in a complicated political climate where intrigue is endemic to court life. The Ottoman Empire is in turmoil at this point in history, the British insinuating themselves into local politics in an effort to stabilize the region and discourage an alliance with the Russians. Probing for information from reluctant subjects, Kamil sorts through misinformation and half-truths, the most troubling evidence a silver necklace found on Mary's body that leads him to the death of another European governess in the Sultan's employ a few years earlier.In Turkey, bureaucracy is layered with ritual, bribery, social agendas and self-protection. Thanks to current political uncertainties, the magistrate must navigate the subtle tension between cultures, the British presence disturbing the balance of the old ways, threatening the future. Kamil treads lightly as he interviews a variety of persons who may hold the key to Mary's death, an agonizingly slow process. Most prefer that this distasteful subject go away before anyone important is embarrassed, the mystery made more difficult by the constraints of a society with rigid standards of behavior, each new clue fraught with ambiguity. From the royal palaces to the home of the English ambassador, Kamil uncovers unexpected intrigues, finding himself attracted to an unlikely young woman, the English ambassador's daughter, Sybil. It is she who discovers a critical piece of information, thanks to her friendship with the women of the harem, unwittingly putting herself in danger in her naivet&eacute; and desire to please the conscientious magistrate.White unveils an assortment of characters straight out of the pages of Scheherazade, powerful men and their servants, eunuchs, manipulative women in the Sultan's harem and a young woman who suffers the rejection of society after a brutal attack that ruins her hope for marriage. Individual stories take on lives of their own, clouding the murder with layers of deceit, passion and betrayal. Anthropologist White does an impressive job, mixing fiction with history, the changing face of the Ottoman Empire struggling against outside influences, a burgeoning science vs. traditional religion and a patriarchal society that leaves women to forge their own rules, where jealousy foments in silence and power is sheathed in a velvet glove, but just as deadly. Luan Gaines/ 2006."},{"Title":"The Sultan's Seal: A Novel","review":"In 1886 as the Ottoman Empire shows signs of old age lethargy, the upper elite of society is a hodgepodge of British expatriates mingling with Turks. However, most natives of Istanbul are concerned with what is perceived the outrageous avante garde behavior of Englishwomen.Thus the Turks are not stunned to learn of the drowning death of and Englishwoman, imperial harem governess Mary Dixon, whose drugged body was found in the Bosphorus. Though she was considered reticent and no social butterfly; however, her home country expatriates are shocked as they felt they were superior to the masses and thus quite safe. . Magistrate Kamil Pasha leads the official investigation assisted by Jewish surgeon, Michel Sevy. Upon seeing the corpse, Michel says the victim was too healthy to have been an opium user; this she was murdered by drug poisoning. However, neither have access to the pillars of society especially females where the case leads. Thus the Magistrate enlists Sybil Hanoun, daughter of the British ambassador, to join his team. They soon find an apparent sexual link between the deceased and Jaanan, raped by the man chosen by her father as her husband and propositioned by the dead Mary.THE SULTAN'S SEAL is a terrific late nineteenth century police procedural that shines a deep light on Turkey at an interesting moment when the Ottoman Empire is starting to collapse. Though too many suspenseful sidebars causing some difficulty in following the inquiries, the who-done-it is deftly developed so that the audience understands the societal pecking order, however takes a back seat to the rich historical tidbits. Fans who enjoy a lot of history in their mystery will want to read J.B. White's fine tale.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Sultan's Seal: A Novel","review":"This is the tale of two murders and how the investigation draws the magistrate and the daughter of the British Ambassador into the plot(s) that resulted in these murders while simultaneously drawing them into a romance.There is all the languid diffidence of cross cultural diplomacy, late nineteenth century imperialism and social reform in the last days of the Ottoman Empire. Sexuality is an important motive, but more as an obsession of the characters than as a pornographic description for readers. ( Virginity, honor and reputation, dowery, sexual segregation, etc.)Much of the plot depends upon the ability of the ambassador's daughter to move between the world of the Sultan's harem ( a world of women)and that of the magistrate (a world of men). The second narrative voice, an aristocratic young woman, will eventually reveal information about the murders to the reader which does not really come to the magistrate or the daughter; although, the truth they learn is sufficient for them. A complex and appropriately byzantine plot. Not a fast read."},{"Title":"The Sultan's Seal: A Novel","review":"Jenny White's well-written novel set in the waning Ottoman empire falls somewhat short of its literary ambitions but is a worthwhile read nonetheless.She attempts not one but four literary artifices that I generally don't care for. The main narrative is in the present tense; hard to do, not sure why anyone tries. She shifts from third-person narrative to first-person narrative (in past tense); always jarring. She intersperses that with yet another first-person, epistolary narrative. All this makes a woman writing about a male character the least of her offenses.While the writing itself is of a very high quality, all this jumping around makes the narrative jerky and sometimes confusing.I read this because I am a fan of Jason Goodwin's mysteries, also set in Istanbul. While Goodwin's Yashim is set in the 1830s, White's Kamil Pasha is set in the 1880s. The half-century time difference permits Goodwin to keep much more of the Oriental exoticism. Yashim dresses in robes and turban, while Kamil wears a coat and fez. Goodwin manages some scenes in Topkapi palace while White must move on the newer, less exotic palaces.Both writers, however, glory in the charm of Istanbul and the wonders of the Ottoman culture. White's language is even more elegant and powerful in rendering this other time and place.But I have some other criticisms of this book. Kamil Pasha, unlike Yashim, is not a eunuch, and yet is not particularly virile or convincing as a male character. This book dwells far too long on an incipient romance between Kamil and the daughter of the English ambassador in ways that neither move the plot along or really give us more depth of character. As a result, important allies or would-be allies of magistrate Kamil, the police surgeon and the daughter's American cousin, get short shrift and are never satisfactorily developed for the roles they play. The overlapping, jumbled narratives leave us wondering about motivation, and at the end of the book it's fair to say the reader is not really sure who killed whom or why.White has since produced two more Kamil Pasha novels and presumably has overcome some of these first-novel jitters. If I do go on to read the subsequent novels, though, it will be for her lyrical descriptions of this period rather than any love for Kamil Pasha."},{"Title":"The Sultan's Seal: A Novel","review":"I will be very brief. As a suspense, mystery or crime novel, Sultan's Seal is not very satisfying. However, Western and even some Turkish readers like myself might praise the author for reconstructing Istanbul in 1886 with good amount of historical and cultural detail.The writing is at times poetic which fits well with the exotic atmosphere created. Perhaps it is safe to say Istanbul itself from a foreigner's point of view is the main character of the novel.Having said this, I believe using the love for Istanbul as an excuse to write a historical crime novel set in Istanbul is somewhat disappointing.If you can read it without caring too much for the plot, which is not very expertly cosntructed, you will enjoy it. I could not read it that way as I know Istanbul by heart."},{"Title":"The Sultan's Seal: A Novel","review":"The writing is gorgeous, the story sensual and mysterious and the setting exotic (19th century Turkey).

Mysteries in an exotic place in a bygone age executed with an eye for detail and adherence to cultural accuracy are much harder to come by.You'll probably like this book if you like straight forward whodunnits set in an exotic location. No CSI, no gadgets, no technical wizardry, just plain unraveling of a mystery. Still, the character of Kamil Pasha is engaging, and I'm hoping that White will develop him and fill him out. I thinks she's chosen a great location and a good time period to give herself plenty of room to develop a great character.If you don't like period pieces, the middle east, lack of technical wizardry, or everyday experiences in your stories, then you probably won't enjoy this book."},{"Title":"The Sultan's Seal: A Novel","review":"The Sultan's Seal by Jenny White was obviously a first novel from someone who is not a novelist. The backdrop of ninetheenth century Istanbul is fascinating for lovers of history, and the cultural and religious conflicts in this book illustrate how complex that time period was. The problem is that this could have all been accomplished in a work of non-fiction.The writing in this novel was weak and very confusing. The author jumps from one story line to another without transitioning very well which leaves the reader confused. The main character Kamil Pasha seems to have less mention in the text than a character named Jaanan. This shows the inexperience of the author.Over all the novel was slightly entertaining and was easy to read. If you can get past the bad writing and cliche characters (Bernie especially) you might enjoy this book."},{"Title":"The Sultan's Seal: A Novel","review":"I'm giving this one three stars because it may indeed have some merits recognized by other readers. Sadly, I find it impossible to read a work of fiction that is set entirely in the present tense, and so my high hopes for The Sultan's Seal were CRUSHED when I realized that this was the case here. I gave up in Chapter 2. I just can't stand this modern affectation, which has ruined several other mystery series, as well as individual books by authors I love like John Le Carre and Hilary Mantel. It's too bad -- what great subject matter and historical/cultural setting. I ordered Ms. White's second and third books in this series from the library, but will have to return them unread if they are also written in this artifical and most irritating manner."},{"Title":"The Sultan's Seal: A Novel","review":"In 1886 the Ottoman Empire rules Istanbul and the sultan's power is obsolete: in his city one Kamil hears of a strange unsolved murder of a British woman whose one identifying mark is a pendant engraved with the sultan's seal.

Excellent historical flavor and details permeate a fast-paced historical suspense novel."},{"Title":"The Sultan's Seal: A Novel","review":"In 1886 Istanbul social unrest is heating up especially with the numerous British expatriates living the good life in the city while many Turks struggle as the once mighty Ottoman Empire nears collapse. Many of the locals are especially outraged by the total disregard of native custom by these aristocratic British immigrants, who flaunt their immodesty.However, both groups are stunned when royal governess Mary Dixon is brutally murdered. The English demand swift justice while many Turks believe she deserved it as all English females are brazen. In reality few knew the reticent Mary. At the same time Magistrate Kamil Pasha investigates the homicide while also struggling to keep the peace between the angry groups, a local girl Jaanan is forced by her family to marry a man she fears almost as much as she loathes even as he is linked to the English victim.Jenny White paints a powerful and colorful panorama of late nineteenth century Istanbul at a time when national fervor is heated in every corner of the capital city. Though Kamil is a fascinating protagonist struggling with a difficult case made geometrically harder by English and Turkish demands, the whodunit takes a back seat to touring 1886 Istanbul. Fans will enjoy visiting the palace especially the harem, the various ethnic quarters and finally the affluent European section mostly English expatriates that anger the native purists with its gaudy brashness.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Sultan's Seal: A Novel","review":"It took a little bit longer to receive the item than I had hoped for, but it was exactly as described.

Which, I think it might be, if I could get past the author's use of present tense and third-person narrator.

But here, it just seemed like an awkward stylistic decision that didn't work."},{"Title":"The Sultan's Seal: A Novel","review":"The Sultan's Seal is the first historical mystery by Jenny White with detective Kamil Pasha. Set in the Ottoman Empire in 1886 the story is told through three viewpoints. Kamil Pasha is the magistrate investigating the drowning of a young Englishwoman which could be connected to a previous unsolved case. Sybil is the British ambassador's daughter who assists Kamil with his investigation. Jaanan is a native woman who seems to have some connection with both victims.I do understand why Jaanan's viewpoint is included but I think it is the weakest part of the book. Her storyline takes away from Kamil's investigation and his development as a character and, honestly, she makes some ridiculous decisions. At one point she talks about how happy she is at her childhood home, but after that, whenever she returns, she can't wait to escape again. And there are moments when something seems extremely obvious but she remains oblivious. I found her to be a frustrating character who is a little self absorbed and never really gets over that despite some major wake up calls.Also, I expected more historical detail about the Ottoman empire. It would have been interesting to have more details on what police procedure would have consisted of or even more detail on the political climate. But instead Kamil appears to be perhaps a little too modern for his time and only an acceptable investigator.The book was a quick read and I enjoyed most of Kamil and Sybil's viewpoints and would have liked to hear more from them. I would definitely read the next in the series as I feel it has the potential to be really good."},{"Title":"The Sultan's Seal: A Novel","review":"I searched for mysteries set in Istanbul because I just visited the city.

Most mystery stories are solved by the laying of a foundation, almost like masonry work, but this story is told colorful thread by thread until the pattern is almost complete.

I was never sure exactly how our main characters are supposed to save Ombria. Longer review at ImpatientReader-dot-com."},{"Title":"Ombria in Shadow","review":"Patricia McKillip at her worst is far better than usual fantasy writing, and here she is in fine form. Three-dimensional characters, flowing plot, flowery prose all meld together into a satisfying novel.Gloom and shadow fall over the city of Ombria as its ruling prince lies dying, leaving four people in the palace: Kyel, his child-heir who is traumatized by the loss of his family and friends. Lydea, the prince's mistress from a tavern, who genuinely mourns him. Domina Pearl (also called \\"Black Pearl\\"), an ancient, hideous, deathless, inhuman woman who seeks to control Kyel for her own power over Ombria. And Ducon Greve, the prince's silver-eyed nephew, whose father is a mystery and who expresses himself through charcoal drawings.When the prince dies, Kyel becomes the new prince -- but not before Domina Pearl throws Lydea out of the palace, and she flees to her father's grimy tavern -- only to find that she longer belongs there, but that she never belonged at the palace either.. Ducon is asked by nobles to try to overthrow the Black Pearl, but his sole concern seems to be for Kyel's safety, and he cannot act if it could hurt his young cousin. And in the \\"undercity,\\" the sorceress Faey (who is definitely not human) is hired to \\"undo\\" Ducon -- except her waxling Mag (a living creature formed from wax) doesn't want Ducon to be killed.But the political strife is only a portent of things to come. It's all linked to strange, ancient events that start with \\"perilous times, a desperate city, the ruling house in chaos, in danger.\\" It's all linked to Ducon, Domina Pearl, Mag, a locket of blood and rose petals, a children's tale, and the shadow.Like many of her recent books, this book focuses on several individuals whose lives interconnect within the main plot. As for the plot itself, well, expect the unexpected. In some ways it resembles \\"Song for the Basilisk,\\" a prior book of McKillip's, with its mingling of magic and politics; also, Domina Pearl is in some ways reminiscent of the Basilisk, with her aura of quiet, stifling malevolence. But while the plotline of \\"Basilisk\\" was politics fueled by magic, it's the reverse here, magic fueled by politics; also, while the Basilisk was the figure on the throne, Domina Pearl is the power behind the throne. The \\"shadow city\\" is freshly created and beautifully explains certain plot points.Like Morgan of the Riddle-Master trilogy, Ducon Greve is a quiet person who doesn't particularly want to get involved in earthshaking events, but has to anyhow. Lydea's growth is also well-done, as she tries to help Ducon and Kyel. Mag is a little more difficult to connect to at first, as she seems to think in a manner entirely differently from Lydea and more like (but not exactly like) Ducon. As the book unfolds, we do see more of her emotions and feelings. Faey is one of the most original characters -- we're never entirely sure what she is or what her motivations are, aside from herself. But that never makes her unsympathetic or hard to connect to.McKillip's writing is, as always, lush and detailed without being smothering. Her dialogue ranges from beautiful and poetic to downright funny in a few places, down to Kyel playing with his little puppets. And we have yet another gorgeous Kinuko Craft cover (look carefully for the black pearls in Lydea's hair).This will probably be one of the best fiction releases all year, a tale of power-seeking, magic, the cycles of history, ghosts, shadows, and underground sorcery. A treasure."},{"Title":"Ombria in Shadow","review":"Reading Patricia McKillip is akin to lucid dreaming; I am aware that the world is not real and is not functioning according to everyday logic, but people and events form oddly beautiful and meaningful patterns. I slow down, reading individual words instead of compressing them into sentences and paragraphs; McKillip's language is half the pleasure of her books.The other thing I love about McKillip is how little her books resemble cookie-cutter \\"fantasy\\" dreck. While her books are all reminiscent of each other, they are all individual. And they are not like anything else I've read. \\"Ombria in Shadow\\" is no exception.Ombria is an ancient city; its past lies buried underground, layers of buildings and previous incarnations of the city shrouded in darkness. Aboveground, the city is troubled. The prince has died, leaving his five-year-old son Kyel Greve under the control of Domina Pearl, a woman who is steadily running Ombria into the ground for her own purposes. She is opposed by the prince's mistress, Lydea; his bastard nephew, the artist Ducon Greve; Mag, the \\"waxling\\" servant of a mysterious sorceress who lives in the underground city; and various coalitions of nobles who know nothing of the magical forces also working in Ombria.Magic and legends of a shadow city weave in and out of the political story. I am still not sure how everything connects, particularly since none of the characters completely understands what happens towards the end. I am not terribly convinced by the explanations given to Ducon and Mag, and the last chapter left me thoroughly confused. However, while the story leaves a lot to be desired on the everyday level, the end *feels* right.I just wish it made sense, too."},{"Title":"Ombria in Shadow","review":"I haven't read every McKillip book, but I've read a lot of them, and like some reviewers, I felt unfulfilled by this one. Despite the artistry of her words, I was just unfulfilled. After wondering about it, I finally realized why. McKillip's characters experience suffering and pain, just like you and me, and the richness of that pain experience -- how it deepens who they are and how they interact with others -- is part of their attraction. Perfect examples are in \\"Riddlemaster\\", \\"Atrix Wolfe\\", \\"Forests of Serre\\" and \\"Basilisk.\\" Just about every book she writes, characters persevere through suffering, and their images seen through the lens of that suffering are strong and always hopeful.That is what is lacking in this book (and here comes the spoiler). Most of the characters whose suffering the reader has grown to care about forget their suffering. Totally forget, as if it had never happened. No one learns or grows from the experience, no one is strengthened by it. To me, this cheapens what they experienced. It even lessens the hope we should (in classic McKillip) feel for them at the end -- for if no one remembers persevering through a painful past, how does anyone mature towards a hopeful or loving future? What would Morgan of Hed (Riddlemaster) or Ronan of Serre (Forests of Serre) have been like if they had completely forgotten their suffering? (...)Despite her marvelous (as usual) prose here, I will not be buying this one in hardback."},{"Title":"Ombria in Shadow","review":"Patricia Mckillip's best prose returns as she renders this tale of an ancient city teetering between present and past in a rich and satisfying read. She draws you in with her wonderfully rendered language and holds you throughout with this story of tavern-keeper's daughters, ancient sorceresss, bastard princes, amoral tutors and scheming nobles as they via to bring their vision of the city of Ombria from off the pages of history and fairy tale to waking life. Sound like any number of stereotypical fantasy conventions? Think again. Patricia Mckillip is never anything less than original, even when borrowing the trappings of convential fantasy.While each person is interesting the city itself is another character, one afflicted with duel personalities, and Mckillip renders its odd corners, endless layers and hidden depths much as she would another person. The essential mystery is whether Ombria is two cities, one identity dominant while the other lies dormant. The conflict between the two halves of the city is mirrored in the opposing forces of the two sorceress, Dominia Pearl, regent to a powerless boy-prince (and a pirate to boot!)who is determined to bring the shadow city to life for her gain. Faey, a power so old she has forgetten more than any remember goes her own way in the hidden undercity of Ombria, sending her \\"waxling\\" Mag into the world to fetch her needs. Only when Mag decides to meddle in the affairs of the Black Pearl and join with those opposing her is Faey moved to act.Mckillip's tale winds through secret passages in the castle, between the covers of old children's tales and in the sketches of the bastard painter Ducon as the stuggle for power and possession of the city unfolds. Only through unlocking the mysteries of their own shadowy pasts will Mag and Ducon hope to tip the balance of Ombria to the side of light. The end, when it comes is a bittersweet one, for both the characters and the reader. A thoroughly engrossing tale."},{"Title":"Ombria in Shadow","review":"I would actually give this book 4.5 stars if I could, but since that's not an option, 4 stars is better. I do agree with some of the other reviews saying that there is something missing from the book. It just...I want to know more! And that's a good thing! I find myself thinking about this book constantly. It's very thought-provoking, because you don't REALLY understand what's going on sometimes, and I've had to read parts over because I just flew by readung it the first time. It's a VERY interesting book. It's definetly not just any fantasy. When I was reading it, and after I finished, this book feels very much like a dream. It has that dream-quality, where it just kind of floats by, and after you've woken up, you don't really remembered what happened.It is a very good book, if you want something a little different, with intresting characters (for some reason, I particularly liked Ducon. I think it had something to do with the hair! He was just a cool character, in my opinion) I think no matter how many times you read this book, you'll still want more."},{"Title":"Ombria in Shadow","review":"It's hard not to fall in love with Patricia McKillip's characters, who try to do right in the face of overwhelming evil. Especially since her characters are embedded like jewels in the cities of Ombria and Shadow Ombria (think of an ancient Italian city like Ravenna, saturated in sorcery, where every shadow may reflect a distant age, a different ruler).Careful reading reveals the intricacies of the plot that twines around the characters of a bastard artist-prince, the former ruler's mistress, the young prince of Ombria, and his evil regent, Domina Pearl. There is also a young girl named Mag, who is not even sure she is human, and a powerful sorceress named Faey, who lives in the shadows and sends Mag on the oddest errands:\\"She [Mag] bought a lamb's heart at the butcher's. She waited at a familiar doorway for goats' eyes and candles made of goat fat. At a small shop with dusty windows and an ancient apothecary sign, she picked up powdered bone and extractions from strange, fleshy plants that had been diverted from Domina Pearl's pirate ships. For the cook, she bought violets. At the brewer's, she traded silver for quicksilver, and a crock of Faey's favorite ale.\\"Mag ingratiates herself into the plot: small drops of quicksilver against the dark palette of two powerful magicians---Mag's mistress and Domina Pearl---who vie for control of the true Ombria. The story line may well remind readers of \\"Song for the Basilisk,\\" where the Basilisk's daughter intrudes between her father's magic and that of a musician-sorcerer's. I think \`Ombria' has the edge over \`Basilisk' in that Domina Pearl's motives are easier to understand, and she is more briskly evil than was the Basilisk-prince.As always, Kinuko Craft's cover art is a match for McKillip's intoxicating prose."},{"Title":"Ombria in Shadow","review":"McKillip's books are always a treat to read but she has really outdone herself with her new book. The style remains her distinctive familiar flavor while further developing her own voice. As she has delved into the language of music, of color and of nature in her other books, here she explores the language of light and shadows. The book also covers deeply sypathetic themes of children growing up and parents letting go. The characters are colorful and diverse and she increases her range of character from a couple of main figures to several fully developed personalities. The ending, while surprisingly poignant, is different from all her other &quot;ending types&quot; and displays definite growth and increased comfort in taking risks with the reader's heart to end the story the way it truly should be. McKillip's knack for blending several unconnected threads into one magnificent tapestry really makes the book an immensely satisfying read. Overall, the book will be a delight to McKillip veterans as well as those who are drawn to the beauty of the cover to discover the rich rewards of her writing."},{"Title":"Ombria in Shadow","review":"Like all of Patricia McKillip's books, \\"Ombria in Shadow\\" is a dreamy, intricate tale, made memorable by her distinctive poetic prose. Symbols, circumstances and meanings can be interpreted on any number of deeper levels, making her books ones to be savoured and re-read. If you are a lover of eloquent poetry and subtle imagery, then let \\"Ombria in Shadow\\" be the first of McKillip's range of stories to let you drift away on language that must have been meticulously chosen in order to create a sense of faery and dreaming.The royal prince of Ombria is dead, leaving a child-heir, a grieving mistress and a confused bastard nephew at the mercy of Domina Pearl ('The Black Pearl'), the regent of the city, who is seemingly immortal and has her own dark plans for the ruling of the oldest city in the world. Casting the young mistress Lydea onto the streets and poisoning the young prince Kyel into a state of deep depression is just the beginning. The bastard-son Ducon is drawn almost against his will into the designs of the noble conspirators, when all he wishes to do is attempt to fulfil his passion for drawing doorways, windowsills and other openings - searching for something in his pictures that he doesn't understand.Meanwhile, the mysterious sorceress Faey dwells in the shadows beneath the city, doing whatever magical task the highest bidder pays her for, along with her magical \\"waxling\\" Mag. A creature of magic is what Mag has been led to believe she is, but after accidentally swallowing a heart-spell of Faey's, she begins to feel rather human emotions that bring her tangled into the conspiracy of the crown, with her own part to play...Perhaps the inclusion of all these characters without a clear protagonist is a slight fault of the novel, but in a way I think that is a technique that McKillip sought to take, in the way of puttin Ombria itself in the title role, with all her characters fitting together like a jig-saw puzzle in order to save it. Certainly out of everything, Ombria is her most fascinating creation. Below the sunny streets lies another Ombria, a shadow Ombria: the city's own past. Ghosts and magic dwell there, and the entrances are through abandoned doors and shadows. It is almost as if time itself runs differently in the city - it runs not horizontally, from left to right, but vertically, with the city's past gradually sinking downwards into the underworld (an idea helped along greatly by the imagery presented in the great underground river, lined with empty houses and its black surface lit by lamps). I was utterly intoxicated by such an idea, and the language with which it was used suited it perfectly.As it is, I wasn't entirely satisfied by the conclusion; it was suitably ambiguous, but still didn't answer all my questions, especially concerning the relationship and the real nature of Faey and the Black Pearl. But nonetheless \\"Ombria in Shadow\\" is a wonderful read, and comes complete with another of K. Y. Craft's beautiful title covers, which is well worth the price of any book!"},{"Title":"Ombria in Shadow","review":"I loved this book for its poetic language, its characters and its atmosphere. I was surprised, however, that the ending revealed so little. There seemed to be such original ideas brewing beneath the surface of the politics and intrigue. Unless I missed something, it never explained what the Shadow city was, what its relationship to Ombria was, what the shift was, why it happened, or who the sorceresses were. I picked up some implications that Mag may have been half of the shadow city, but it never said, and it didn't say whether she was related to Ducon in some way. I suppose the characters' lives were fixed in the end, but I was still confused. I wanted a more in-depth revelation of the nature of this world."},{"Title":"Ombria in Shadow","review":"Since &quot;The Book of Atrix Wolfe&quot; left me a little cold, I was leery of reading another McKillip book. I'm so glad I picked up this one, though! I've seldom enjoyed reading a book this much...and while it is a light read, the tale stays with you.This story is *almost* a fairy tale, although which one, I can't put my finger on. There are elements of Cinderella and The Snow Queen, but nothing definate. &quot;Ombria In Shadow&quot; does have all thr makings of a real fairy tale in and of its own right, though--a beautiful damsel in distress, a handsome half-human hero, a plucky heroine, a shapeshifing sorceress, a shadow city, magic toads, shoes made out of sapphires, enchanted artwork, and an evil witch who, for whatever reason, reminded me of Yubaba in &quot;Spirited Away.&quot;I would totally recommend this book to anyone who loves fairy tales and who's looking for a luxurious weekend read."},{"Title":"Ombria in Shadow","review":"It's been many years since I found a new fantasy novel that didn't seem just so much more rehashed Tolkien. With the current fantasy resurgence there are more \\"good vs. evil/ misfit saves the kingdom with the help of faithful sidekick\\" type books than ever before. Obviously there is a large fan base for this type of book, but I find it impossible to keep reading about graceful & enigmatic elves/fairies siding with gruff but stouthearted trolls/dwarfs to help a (half)human teenager who has been chosen by mysterious wizard, y'know? I mean, how many times can this story be reworked, anyway?Thank Gandalf, Patricia McKillip has NEVER written that sort of fantasy which is why I decided to pick up \\"Ombria in Shadow\\" at all. The last 2 books of hers I had read (\\"Song for the Basilisk\\" & \\"The Book of Atrix Wolf\\") hadn't seemed up to her early standard, so I had lost interest in following her career. \\"Ombria in Shadow\\" returns to the brilliance Ms. McKillip displayed in \\"The Forgotten Beasts of Eld\\"; even some of the characters seem reminiscent, without being duplicates.The plot is unique: the City/Kingdom of Ombria exists in the present & in the shadows lies the many-layered past of Ombria. Abandoned buildings standing in present day streets lead to Ombria's past, where dwells the ghosts, memories, buildings, & treasures of history alongside an underground river. The only \\"living\\" creatures dwelling in Ombria's past are the faceless sorceress Faey & her \\"waxling\\" Mag. Meanwhile, in the Palace, the Prince has just died, killed by the ancient Black Pearl, an evil presence who claims to be the great-aunt of the ruling family. The Prince's mistress, Lydea, is thrown out into the lawless streets to fend for herself, & his 5 year-old son is left alone in the Palace with no allies except the mysterious bastard cousin who does nothing but draw all day. Confused yet? You won't be.Patricia McKillip writes so beautifully, you would swear that a medieval troubadour was singing the story in a banqueting hall. The reader can almost smell the moldering tapestries & dust in the hidden maze of Ombria's Palace. The breadth of her imagination is truly breathtaking.So why only a rating of 4? Personally, I felt the last chapter to be a bit of an easy way out. It wasn't as bad as the infamous \\"it was all a dream\\" twist, but it certainly wasn't up to the caliber of what came before. Did the author run out of time? Was there some personal tragedy in her life that caused her to be distracted as she came to the last chapter? I wish Ms. McKillip had a website so I could find out more about her. For now though I just have to recommend to any reader looking for truly unique fantasy, pick up \\"Ombria in Shadow\\" or \\"The Forgotten Beasts of Eld\\" or \\"The Riddlemaster Trilogy\\". I personally believe them to be the best fantasy novels written."},{"Title":"Ombria in Shadow","review":"I was excited to try my first McKillip book, and was hooked by the beginning, but this turned into a rather frustrating read.The city-state of Ombria is in decline, made worse when its prince suddenly dies and the sinister, seemingly-immortal Domina Pearl takes over as regent for the five-year-old heir, Kyel. And.... well, the plot is what frustrated me about this book. The writing has a dreamlike quality, and the story didn't seem to be moving toward the obvious confrontation, and I got impatient and wondered what the point was. Looking back, I think it's a good book that I just didn't read with the right mindset, but it's still hard to say much about the plot. But this doesn't mean I thought it was a bad book--it's the kind of book that would probably be better on a re-read.So the characters, then. Most of the main characters are interesting and sympathetic--I liked Mag, Ducon and even Kyel (and that's saying something because usually I don't care for very young children in books). McKillip makes the interesting choice to emphasize child-caretaker bonds and pulls it off well; the relationships are sweet. The one main character I didn't think much of was Lydea, the dead prince's mistress, who turns out to be generic and dull; fortunately though, we get a more unique heroine in Mag.The writing is good, and McKillip does a great job with the atmosphere. The book has a sort of misty fairytale quality that isn't my preference (I like realism and precision in my fantasy), but it's so well-done that it's hard to criticize. And Ombria may not follow logical rules, but it's a fascinating idea.So, if I were to rate this book purely based on my level of enjoyment while reading it, I'd have to give 3 stars, but 4 better reflects its actual quality. I plan to pick up another McKillip book one of these days, when I'm in the right mood, and see if that works out better."},{"Title":"Ombria in Shadow","review":"Having read almost all of McKillip's books, I have come to expect and enjoy a certain style. She has this minimal, vague, poetic way of writing, which I've come to love. Some of her novels are more vague than others (Winter Rose, The Tower at Stony Wood--I'm still not really sure what really happened in those), and Ombria in Shadow falls into the less vague category, but it's still full of McKillip's poetic, lyrical style.Magic is something that character's in her novel deal with everyday, and while they are matter-of-fact about it, McKillip doesn't fail to instill wonder and beauty into that aspect of the story. In fact, magic is the breath and life of her novels, and that coupled with her style is what keeps me reading her work.I really liked the characters of this novel. They were all very distinct, and, as I read more about them, I came to really care about them a lot. The city of Ombria was a character all it's own. I loved how the city had a twin, a mirror image almost, that was and wasn't the city itself. The shadow city and the \\"real\\" city overlap with each other. Is it a shadow city, the city of past, the city's underworld or all three? What are the mysterious transformations that color Ombria's past and how are they connected to the sorceress of the shadow city?The ending...well, I haven't quite decided how I feel about it. I didn't mind that it was a quiet ending; although the previous chapter was somewhat tense, the ending didn't rush to a startling revelation or climax. It answered questions, but raised several as well, allowing the reader to come to their own conclusions. I don't know if any of her novels will ever replace Alphabet of Thorn or the Cygnet Duology at my favorites, but I definitely loved this one."},{"Title":"Ombria in Shadow","review":"Though I like everything of McKillip's that I have read so far, Ombria in Shadow is my favourite. The character of Meg and what she is had me from the beginning and never failed to capture me. I also loved the city, above and below. McKillip is an old fashioned fantasy writer, one who does well at evoking that awe and wonder so often missing in modern fantasy. I will devour every book she puts out."},{"Title":"Ombria in Shadow","review":"I really enjoyed this book, but for some reason it's been really hard to write this review.Ombria in Shadow is not the typical fantasy that I normally read. There is not much action or traditional fantasy elements present here, but McKillip creates a fascinating story with rich characters and an intriguing plot. I found it very hard to put down from beginning to end.This is a novel filled with much political intrigue. There are attempted assassinations, power coups, witches with spells for hire and even pirates (although more of just the mention of pirates!) The pacing of the story is fast and the tensions run pretty high throughout. There is a strong feeling of hope and a fight against the oppressive rule of tyranny. We also see that we actually see of the world with our eyes does not represent the whole. There is a world of shadow beneath Ombria, but not necessarily one of darkness that the word shadow brings to mind.Overall, I would recommend this book to fans of fantasy who would like to expand their horizons beyond the traditional Sword and Sorcery-type tale. It is truly magical and I will be looking into McKillip's other works in the future."},{"Title":"Ombria in Shadow","review":"Very enchanting indeed :). Where did Ms. McKillip get the inspiration? There are so many items in the story itself I want to have i.e. the fan.I really enjoy the multiplied layer of the thrilling terror, mystery and the subtle love story (very subtle, you must pay attention into the word described specially towards the end of the book, yet very rewarding). Simply saying, this book is a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Ombria in Shadow","review":"Patricia Mckillip has a beautiful way with words, painting beguiling pictures with her unexpected word combinations and powerful simile. Her intense storytelling draws even the most unlikely fantasy readers into her world of fey shadows and inexplicable powers. I've been a fan of hers for years and am rarely disappointed by her offerings.Ombria in Shadow follows the seemingly unrelated lives of five complicated characters as their world shifts and falls to pieces around them. The crown prince of Ombria has died, and now his mistress, Lydea, and his son, Kyel, find themselves at the mercy of the powerful Domina, the Black Pearl, oldest woman in Ombria. She works their lives into a tapestry made to serve her lust for rule, weaving intrigue and despair within the palace walls. Few can stand when confronted with her power; among these is Duncon, the mysterious artist who has no father and whose face betrays the powers to whose ancestry he belongs. He stumbles upon the Undercity, where Faey, the beautiful sorceress, and her daughter, Mag, spin ancient spells for Ombria's living and its dead. All five become embroiled in what seems an unending tangle of intrigue and death, working against time to deflect Domina's designs and save Ombria from the shadows that threaten it.The book is at once intriguing and frustrating: we find ourselves turning each page in hopes that some of the many mysteries will somehow be cleared up in the next paragraph, only to be disappointed. McKillip, ever the crafty author, keeps us waiting until the very end before she reveals truth, but still, we are not satisfied. The book ends with too many threads left unresolved; it is as if, once she had crafted a book about shadows and their possibilities, she left it without even trying to explain to the reader exactly what all those shadows were about.Despite the enchanting prose and luxurious descriptions, in terms of storytelling and plot, McKillip has done much better than this. If you would like the true measure of this amazing author's work, see The Riddle Master: the Complete Trilogy, and then read Winter Rose. Only with this combination will you understand the true power of McKillip's work."},{"Title":"Ombria in Shadow","review":"I stayed up until three finishing this book. It is a good solid fantasy book with enjoyable, believable characters."},{"Title":"Ombria in Shadow","review":"Check out jsolinas' review for a better summary of the plot than I can give. I'll just tell you what I liked and didn't like about _Ombria in Shadow_.What I liked: The prose was gorgeous. Much like the author's nearly perfect _Winter Rose_, this book is like one of those lush dreams that seems more real than reality. McKillip shows her writing \\"chops\\" off to best advantage in this novel.What I didn't like: The villain was a one-dimensional cliche, and several of the protagonists were just too Nice And Sweet for my taste. I guess the real gripe is that McKillip spent so much time on her setting that the characters suffered by comparison. And while several of her other books feature ambiguous situations where you don't know whose side to take, it's clear from page one of _Ombria_ that Domina Pearl has to go. I prefer my good and evil a little murkier and greyer.Overall, this book works as a sort of prose poem; read it for the beauty of the writing, and maybe for the interesting concept of the shadow city, but don't expect an epic."},{"Title":"Ombria in Shadow","review":"A young prince who could inherit his kingdom finds an evil great-aunt stands in his way, while a sorceress weaves spells which also will influence the direction of a divided kingdom in this complex and fine fantasy, powered by strong characters and confrontations with good and evil."},{"Title":"Ombria in Shadow","review":"Ombria in Shadow is a great book. Patricia McKillip's true conquest is one of language. It took me two chapters to really find a groove with the reading, but once I did, the book wasn't long enough. I kept wanting the chapters to be longer, I kept wanting to spend more time with the characters. For me, that's a mark of great writing.For anyone who reads fantasy, here's a chance for something different. For anyone who pointedly doesn't read fantasy, here's a chance for something different. I would definitely say that this is a reader's book."},{"Title":"Ombria in Shadow","review":"As always, McKillip's prose is exquisite, particularly suitable to this fairy tale that also pays homage to many elements of the gothic literary tradition. The characters are fascinating sketches of otherwise tired archetypes: the evil sorceress (Domina Pearl), the bastard prince (Ducon Greve), the orphan (Mag), and so forth. Their growth throughout the story as they react to how the death of their ruler changes their lives gives this tale emotional depth. The plot moves quickly -- perhaps at times too much so -- and there are a myriad of threads and subthreads to follow. No one character seems to emerge as a protagonist, but as a team, the cast tells the story well. Still, there are a few things left unresolved at the end of the book which left me wanting more. While the worldbuilding is an extravaganza of imagination, there were times I wished a few things had been articulated a bit more clearly throughout. All in all, though, a beautiful book and a wonderful reading experience. Definitely recommended."},{"Title":"Ombria in Shadow","review":"Patricia McKillip just keeps getting better. Her characters are fascinating and complex, and their surroundings are magically detailed. The setting of this particular novel is at least as important as the characters. McKillip never states anything outright, and this novel is especially shrouded, which lends it a hallucinatory air and makes you believe that Ombria truly is In Shadow. Don't expect this author to hold your hand, and don't expect explanations. Do expect a haunting, perfectly written experience that you will want to return to again and again. Peter S. Beagle said, &quot;There are no better writers than Patricia McKillip&quot;, and this novel proves yet again that he was right."},{"Title":"Ombria in Shadow","review":"For a novel that started off so great with such promise, I was a bit disappointed to give \\"Ombria in Shadow\\" just three stars. Patricia McKillip is a very skilled writer and her writing talent is clearly evident in this book but somewhere towards the end I lost all interest in the book. It's not that the book was a chore to finish but as I kept getting towards the end I was wondering where the story was going. I didn't know if McKillip would throw in a plot twist or what, but I found the last third or so of the book to be inferior to the rest.The novel takes place in Ombria, the greatest city in the world. When the book opens up the reader will learn how the prince of Ombria lies dying and his son, who happens to be a young boy, is the next, and last in the Greve family, in power for the throne. The regent ends up being the evil witch Domina Pearl, also known as The Black Pearl. The main characters of the novel are Ducon, the prince's cousin; Lydea, the prince's former servant and playmate; and Mag, the apprentice to a sorceress in the undercity, a dark area of Ombria full of magic. This novel chronicles all of the characters and how they react with one another, and eventually how everything comes together in the end.Let me start off with the good that I found in this book. Patricia McKillip is a true master of the craft, with intricate prose, characterizations, and descriptions. It is a joy to read about the city of Ombria and everything that goes on in it, especially that which takes place in the undercity. Most of the characters are completely drawn out and well written, especially the three main characters. McKillip's style is easy to read and feels just like the story is being told to you verbally as everything is simple and just flows along gracefully.Now, the problems. From the beginning of the novel I was hooked and kept reading thinking that the novel would get better and better as each page moved along. This didn't happen. Everything seemed to stay the same with not much development in the plot for most of the book. As the last one hundred or so pages dawned on me things started coming together, but when everything was resolved I asked myself, \\"Is that it? It's all done?\\" The ending seemed to be very rushed and and wasn't brought out to it's full potential. I also found that as the story progressed that the plot got very shallow. I thoought that the only depth in the book were the characters.Despite the negative parts that I found in the book, I still enjoyed the book to a certain degree. This will not be my last book by McKillip. In fact, I look forward to reading a lot more of her works as I saw the potential of her writing here. \\"Ombria in Shadow\\" is not a must read for the general fantasy fan, but can still be enjoyed in that it is pretty original.Happy Reading!"},{"Title":"Ombria in Shadow","review":"A good chef can make wonderful pastries from ordinary ingredients. That's how McKillip writes: she starts with the evil queen, a half-hidden mage, a city on the edge of shadow, and the eventual defeat of evil. There's a princeling, not yet of age, around whom the intrigues and fights for dominance center. McKillip turns these basics into a very readable, enjoyable fantasy.There's enough left unsaid at every step to hold a reader's attention: what is that other city, the one without daylight? Who, or what is that artist? Why does each thing he draws take on extra meaning? I won't spoil the story by saying too much - there are many other questions to be answered before the book is over.This book is clearly aimed at readers with more interest in the people involved, and less interest in weapons and combat. It's fast-paced, but gentle and a bit romantic. The right reader will get a lot of pleasure from it."},{"Title":"Ombria in Shadow","review":"From reading this book one can tell that Patricia A. Mckillip is a very good author. Her use of literary devices are spectacular and the story is quite in-depth. I did enjoy this book, but I was very confused throughout most of it. It's somewhat thought provoking yet too far out to actually relate to. Something was lacking as well, I'm not quite sure what it was. Perhaps it's that in the beginning of the book there wasn't much plot development. Although regardless of that it still feels like there is something missing.All in all, I don't regret reading this book. I was just bothered by how some aspects of it are nearly incomprehensible."},{"Title":"Ombria in Shadow","review":"A beautifully imagined tale, full of rich, lyrical prose. McKillip's shadow world is fascinating, a recurrence of her theme of parallel worlds joined by gateways that only those that can &quot;see&quot; can access. I loved Mag's character and thought Ducon had a lot of potential, but felt that they lacked a certain emotional depth. As usual, McKillip ends the tale with more ambiguities--no simple &quot;happily ever after&quot; ending for this author! Such is life, I suppose, but in your fiction, it is nice sometimes to have closure...and I had hoped that Mag and Ducon would end up falling in love, so ended a bit disappointed."},{"Title":"Ombria in Shadow","review":"first of all i've got to say that i did enjoy most of the parts in this book, just as in books i've read by patricia mckillip, she draw a picture of a beautiful world, occupy with beuatiful people, intriguing riddles and history and magic mixing in a prefect way.this is a story of a few people and how they combine together in a city's and a nation's turning point. the story jumps from a rich palace dominated by a crule old regent named domina pearl, an underworld with ghosts and witches and people who aren't all human, the dangerouse city's streets and tavern, and a beautiful inn wench who used to be the dead prince's misstress, and in between - the bastered son to royalty, ducon grave, and a lost child call meg.just like in all her other worlds - it all mix together, to form a beautiful intence tapestry. why then i think that this book's not as good as &quot;the riddlemaster trilogy&quot; or &quot;the book of atrix woolf&quot;? cause unlike those book, this simply doesn't ends in a satisfing way, it is as if she sets all the scene to have the mystery solved andthen don't find an explenation that's interesting or satisfingenough, which sort of ruin the whole plot.it's still a sweet very visual book, but there are better books by her you could read."},{"Title":"Ombria in Shadow","review":"McKillip has a gift for surprise &amp; for putting together very inventive plots.

The nobles try to unite around Ducon Greve, the Prince's nephew, but Ducon's hands are tied by Domina Pearl's threat to the young prince.Yet Ombria is more than a single city. It's history lies heavy on it, ghosts prowl the streets, and any alley or ruined shop might open the way into another city--a city in shadows. Deep within the city's underworld, a witch child, Mag, follows her witch-mistress's commands, but tries to understand, to think about what she is doing. Although her mistress supports Domina Pearl, Mag knows that she must be opposed.Author Patricia A. McKillip has created a wonderful city of magic. Her descriptions of Ombria ring with truth. Mag, Ducon, and Domina Pearl stand out as complex and motivated characters and their decisions, and the conflict among them, drives the story forward. Even throw-away characters such as the young prince's tutor are fascinating in their own right.OMBRIA IN SHADOW is a superior fantasy novel. On a small canvas, McKillip shows how wonderful fantasy can be."},{"Title":"The Recreation Handbook: 342 Games and Other Activities for Teams and Individuals","review":"Ever need a game?

This book by Robert Loeffelbein has lots of great games, collected from his days as a park superintendent and as a Navy morale officer.

Her ignorance, at times, made the book awkward. This book dealt with a darker side of humanity and touched awkward subjects. The thoughts uncovered by this book are not flattering to the human race. The story left more to be said. The idea was good but the story itself needs work. The color references are easily seen but they dropped off at a certain point. The English is easy to read but the subject matter itself is mature. If I were to give an age group for this book to be read I would say over 13. I would not read this book again because the lack of signficant changes in the plot made the book easy to remember. The fact that she could hate something because of color without another thought made me put the book down. The end was foreshadowed and left nothing to think about. In other books the ending left something to think about or wonder but this book just ended. I will applaud the author for not softening the ending into a fairy tale fantasy. The book was kept real."},{"Title":"Patch of Blue","review":"The book is original because it has it a meaning of the time it is written (1961.) It had a great plot.

This was one of two great black and white (platonic) love stories in which he starred. The other film was the Defiant Ones with Tony Curtis.Sometimes the platonic love stories are the best ones of all because they are matters of the heart and not the body.Poitier's character reached out to Hartman's blind girl out of pure, platonic love. Of course, much of society couldn't believe that his interest in her would stop short of sex. Oh, did his skeptics ever sell him short. Hartman's character did eventually want a physical relationship with her benefactor, but he refused to take advantage of her.In addition to love, this movie soars with hope as Hartman's character is liberated from her horrible home life and poised to receive the education she needs to live an independent and worthwhile life.Both lead characters were outstanding. Hartman wore opaque contact lenses, so she essentially was blind as this movie was being filmed.It was heart-wrenching to watch Ms. Hartman on-screen, and it was ultimately heart-breaking that this gifted actress's life would come to such a tragic end.This was an outstanding film: Hollywood at its finest."},{"Title":"Patch of Blue","review":"A Patch of Blue was the first book about a mixed relationship that I've ever read. I really liked A Patch of Blue because it made a point to me that everyone was created equal and there's nothing wrong with skin color or tone.

She struggles with her disability but also struggles to get a foot-hold into a &quot;normal&quot; life. Not an uplifting story, this is book is brutally honest about the effects of an abusive family on a fragile spirit. Depressing, somewhat, and begins to ask some valid questions about the human condidtion. Unfortunately, it stops there. Interesting only up to a point, I found myself skimming pages, looking for a brake in the rambling storyline. This book would most likely be intriguing only to those unfamiliar or just begining to get into social comentary. Not for the advanced readers, or even mediocre readers. Most likely for the 6th to 7th grade area. I won't give anything away, accept to say it ends weakly. Nothing unexpected in this story. I saw the plot &quot;twists&quot; coming at me like a mac-truck on an otherwise lonely highway on a 3 mile long level plain in Idaho with beacon head-lights a five A.M. Not to say the book is bad, per se, probably better for someone younger than me, though. After reading more advance novels like &quot;To Kill a Mocking Bird&quot;, &quot;A Patch of Blue&quot; reads kind of like &quot;The Cat in the Hat&quot;. The only implications or metaphores in this book are so easily read that you'd have to lock the book in the bottom of a file cabinet to not see them (a plus for some readers), most of which center around colors, and a few around race. If you're looking for some lighter reading (light as in easy, not as in happy), read this, as long as you're not used to difficult novels. If, however, if you're looking for anything with a little more depth or challenge, I wouldn't suggest it."},{"Title":"Patch of Blue","review":"I thought the book was great because is shows a love to all kinds of people.

It is an excellent novel for a first novel. Like one of the other commentators, I found the ending of the book confusing and unclear. It was brave to take on this particular subject matter at the time because the civil rights movement was taking off, freedom riders were going across the south to ensure black voters got their Constitution right to vote, desegregation was a volitile topic, and riots had been breaking out across the country. To infer a possible inter-racial romance was a big risk at the time.It also explores not only the racial prejudice of the time, but shows the ignorance of treating someone with a disability as something shameful (though with the way she became blind, Rose-ann should be ashamed of herself).There are differences between the book and the film, most notably the ending.I must say that while the book is worth reading to remind us of the ignorance of prejudice and the humanity of every human being, the film is better. It is much more hopeful.Below are titles of films and books that explore the results and price of ignorance and prejudice.To Kill a Mockingbird;To Kill a Mockingbird (Collector's Edition);Cry Freedom;Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West;The Diary of a Young Girl: Definitive Edition (Puffin modern classics);A Patch of Blue;In the Heat of the Night (40th Anniversary Collector's Edition)"},{"Title":"Patch of Blue","review":"The other day I stumbled into \\"A Patch of Blue \\" on TV. I couldn't stop watching it, and I rarely head for a tear-jerker. I was so impressed with the film, I had to read the book. The movie adaptation was right on the money, with a different ending. Usually changes in a book's origional ending spell doom, but this movie is a switch! The last chapter of the book is a wreck, almost like it was written by someone else. The author's attempt at a delusional Selena departs from the narration into a suddenly florid language, full of insight, with a vocab that she does not use with this character throughout the whole book. I reread the ending 3 times, and still had trouble establishing the imagery in my mind. And what a time to break down...right at the time when the only person who has helped you in your whole life needs your help. For God's sake...\\"Open your mouth Selina or Sleena...whatever\\"!

Selina is a young woman of eighteen years, blinded accidentally by her mother when she was five. She is neglected, mistreated and abused by the miserable people she lives with, her prostitute mother and drunken grandfather. Somehow, Selina is not scarred by these wretches and grows up to be an attractive, sensitive, caring young woman. Her survival over these odds is almost beyond belief, because of the torment this girl endured quietly for eighteen years. At one point, Rose-ann, Selina's mother, returns, violent and wild, from her minimum-wage job of cleaning restrooms. In a frantic rage, she shatters all the kitchenware, which is left on the floor for Selina to fall on later. She then attacks her daughter. Wrenching her by her hair from under a dirty cot that serves as a bed, she brutally beats her until Selina is bruised, bleeding and vomiting. The plot begins to develop when Selina meets Gordon Ralphe, a stranger, in the park. He treats her with respect and is determined to get her away from the two despicable people she lives with. Their neglect has caused her to be illiterate and ignorant to the ways of the world for having been locked up in a one-room apartment for over thirteen years. Gordon sees that it is imperative for her, as a grown woman, to be educated and aware of the world and out of the harm's way at home. It is no wonder that Selina and Gordon fall in love. He is her only friend and the only person she has ever known to treat her kindly. She is sweet, beautiful, tender, affectionate and tolerant of him, qualities he values in a woman. There is one complication: Gordon is black. In the 1960s, a decade often characterized by racial and ethnic discrimination and hate in the South, this difference poses a serious problem. But what does Selina care? She's blind. Except for the fact that for the few colors she remembers from early childhood, she hates the color black, there should be no problem. She feels this way about the color black partly because she lives with her extremely prejudiced mother and grandfather. Mostly, though, this feeling comes from being trapped in black darkness forever because of blindness. Can their brief, but intense, love break such a strong social barrier? Or are they destined to be separated forever? I won't give away the ending, except to say that I was very disappointed. It was a great story, excellently written, but I found it lacking in the end. It ended flatly and without any clear resolution. The reader is left suspended, thirsting for more details and answers. You may feel as I do, annoyed with a weak finish, or you may be slightly surprised, as it takes an unexpected turn."},{"Title":"Patch of Blue","review":"Since I am black this book The Patch Of Blue was very interesting. I liked the book. It was a love story about a blind white girl that was in love with a black guy who she never knew was black.

It is set in the 1960's when race and prejudice was a problem. A blind girl named Selina gains and loses many things throughout her life. She falls in love with a man without knowing his race. Being blind still makes it hard for her not to be prejudiced against others, as that's all she knows due to her childhood. Her love for Gordon teaches Selina not to be prejudiced, and she finally realizes people are people no matter what their race. Although the book does not have a typical ending, it has a profound effect. A Patch of Blue is a very enjoyable and memorable book. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys love stories, as well as learning about life."},{"Title":"Patch of Blue","review":"This is the story of Selina, a young woman who was blinded at an early age and lives a life of squalor with her hootchie mama and her drunken grandfather. In the park one day stringing beads (her work) she meets Gordon, and they fall in love with one another's inner beauty. Gordon is the only one who has cared enough to teach her anything. Selina's mother has plans to use her daughter in a whorehouse, and it looks like Selina will be forced to go along with it unless Gordon can save her. A movie was made of the novel in the 1960's with Elizabeth Hartman as Selina; Sidney Potier as Gordon; Shelley Winters as the mother; and Wallace Ford as &quot;Ole Pa&quot;, the grandfather. The movie stays true to the book, which is wonderful as the book is so beautifully written. It really made a statement for racial equality in its time and still does today.

After i had procrastinated the reading until the very last weekend of the assignment, i finally settled into the book. Fortunately, it was easy, fast reading. I felt the book was intrigueing and captivating from the very first page until the end. The story is a first person narrative of a strong, young blind girl's life. She has been terribly neglected, having been blinded as a child by her own prostitute mother. She knows only of her one room apartment, and what she's listened to on the radio. In the book, she finally has the oppurtunity to go outside of her dingy apartment. She meets a friend in the park, and discovers what friendship and love is. She realises what a sorry life she's been forced to live through her blindness. The story was beautiful, touching, and honest. The theme of the book was of tolerence. It must have been set in the 1950s or 1960s, and so the plot emphasises the prejudice between blacks and whites, rich and poor. I do feel that i missed much of the suspense of the plot because the cover of the book i used gave away a key to the story. I did not like the bluntness of the books ending.

In my opinion, Kata does a good job using the interesting liability of a blind girl to tell a love story. If you like stories of love that knew no color, then I recommend this book to you. For her first novel I would have to say Elizabeth Kata did fairly well. The beginning of the book grabbed my attention, the middle lost my interest slightly, and the end was confusing and depressing.

This book is Muir's diary of his first summer in the Sierra Nevada. In the spirit of an ascetic mystic, Muir recorded his feelings of wonder as he discovered the awesome beauty of the Sierra Nevada. I held my breath and chuckled as Muir described his encounters with the denizens of the woods. &quot;Having heard that a black bear will run from his bad brother man and deciding I would like to see his gait in running, I rushed and shouted at a large cinnamon colored fellow. To my dismay, he did not run. On the contrary, he stood his ground, ready to fight. Then, I suddenly began to fear upon me would fall the work of running.&quot; For the reader or nature lover who would like to become more familiar with the father of the conservation movement, this is the book to read."},{"Title":"My first summer in the Sierra,","review":"John Muir was born in 1838 and at a young age emigrated from Scotland with his family to a Wisconsin farm. He escaped the hard labor of the farm and his father's backward Biblical obsessions by displaying great powers of visualization. From principles learned from books, he whittled and fashioned barometers, thermometers, clocks and other marvels from the barest of materials. But he repudiated his inventive genius, which could have made him rich, after an industrial accident left him temporarily blinded; and he took off for the wilderness to discover plants and the natural world.This book is a journal account of Muir's finding a place for himself in Yosemite after some dangerous wandering through the hazards of reconstruction in the South after the Civil War. It's a book of discovery. Although flocks of sheep like Muir's employer's were allowed to overrun backcountry meadows, and gold miners had ripped apart the lower river beds, the Sierras then were still a place that had many aspects that had not yet been explored or understood. The backcountry was much more vulnerable to exploitation (though in many ways less endangered) than today, but there was freer and unfettered access for one who sought out it's mysteries and wanted to learn. This book shows Muir's powers of visualization (\\"the eye within the eye\\") in his beginning to formulate the role that glaciers play in the formation of the landscape. No one at that time had come to a solid understanding of what had made Yosemite Valley. And, although it might seem quite clear in retrospect, it took a strong mind of one who up until that time had been adrift in the world, a wanderer who studied plants, to visualize his theories and make them known to the world.Anyone who has not experienced the Sierra first hand cannot really appreciate this book. There are lengthy and numerous descriptions of plants and animals, loving descriptions in Muir's fashion, that can only be understood by one who has reveled in the same places and likewise wants to examine all the details. It's not a purely intellectual appreciation. It's something felt with the whole body, with all the senses alive. Muir always writes of being drawn into Nature, of never turning back, as in the case of his foolhardy venture to the brink of Yosemite Falls, \\"I therefore concluded not to venture farther, but did nevertheless\\". There's also this kind of breathless anticipation of tomorrow- if only I will be given a chance to explore its fountains..."},{"Title":"My first summer in the Sierra,","review":"This is the third of Muir's books that I have read, the first in several years. Gretel Ehrlich writes in her introduction: \\"[Muir] wrote: 'I should like to live here always. It is so calm and withdrawn while open to the universe in full communion with everything good.' And in so speaking of the place he loved best, described himself.\\"In the inimitable way of John Muir, the book is essentially a journal, in this case of his thoughts and travels in the Sierra Nevada Mountains in the summer of 1869. On one day (July 15) he tells of his great desire to look directly down the thousands of vertical feet of Yosemite Falls leading him into a death-defying pilgrimage onto shear rock: \\"If I was to get down to the brink at all that rough edge, which might offer slight finger-holds, was the only way. But the slope . . . looked dangerously smooth and steep, and the swift roaring flood beneath, overhead, and beside me was very nerve-trying. I therefore concluded not to venture farther, but did nevertheless.\\" I'll guess that Muir is the only person to have ever positioned himself on the lip of this great waterfall. Having earlier read of his mountaineering and storm-reveling experiences, even this is not quite surprising. On another day he writes of encountering a brown bear, a housefly, and a grasshopper, and treats them all as being equally fascinating.In a later entry, Muir contemplates raindrops with these words:\\"How far they have to go, how many cups to fill, great and small, cells too small to be seen, cups holding half a drop as well as lake basins between the hills, each replenished with equal care, every drop in all the blessed throng a silvery newborn star with lake and river, garden and grove, valley and mountain, all that the landscape holds reflected in its crystal depths, God's messenger, angel of love sent on its way with majesty and pomp and display of power that make man's greatest shows ridiculous.Now the storm is over, the sky is clear, the last rolling thunder-wave is spent on the peaks, and where are the raindrops now -- what has become of all the shining throng? In winged vapor rising some are already hastening back to the sky, some have gone into the plants, creeping through invisible doors into the round rooms of cells, some are locked in crystals of ice, some in rock crystals, some in porous moraines to keep their small springs flowing, some have gone journeying on in the rivers to join the larger raindrop of the ocean. From form to form, beauty to beauty, ever changing, never resting, all are speeded on with love's enthusiasm, singing with the stars the eternal song of creation.\\"For Muir, the mostly self-educated botanist and geologist, nothing Nature does is anything less than miraculous. Only in our finest moments of insight, revelation if you will, do we see the world as Muir saw it always.[July 12, 1869] \\"We saw another party of Yosemite tourists to-day. Somehow most of these travelers seem to care but little for the glorious objects about them, though enough to spend time and money and endure long rides to see the famous valley. And when they are fairly within the mighty walls of the temple and hear the psalms of the falls, they will forget themselves and become devout. Blessed, indeed, should be every pilgrim in these holy mountains!\\""},{"Title":"My first summer in the Sierra,","review":"Gretel Ehrlich provides the introduction. It is noted that John Muir walked first, wrote later. In 1868 he was thirty years old and had walked a thousand miles. He was a seeker in self-exile such as D.H. Lawrence, Rockwell Kent, and Basho. Muir chronicles a rite of passage. The summer described began in June, 1869. Forty-one years later the account was pieced together.Muir worked for Mr. Delaney as a sheepherder. He had a St. Bernard dog as a companion. Mr. Delaney encouraged Muir to sketch and pursue his naturalist studies. He was to learn that sheep cannot be governed when hungry. Bushes are stripped. The sheep resemble locusts in their destructive potential.Two kinds of squirrels are evident, the Douglas and the California Gray. The wood rat is more like a squirrel than a rat. He bulds large striking looking houses. Sheep camp bread is baked in Dutch ovens. Descriptions of silver firs, Sierra juniper, yellow and sugar pines, Douglas spruce, sequoia, hemlock, and dwarf pines appear in the account of the summer. Nature is extravagant. The group follows the Yosemite trail.Mules flee from bears, and dogs want to. Bears are very shy. Indian patience is required to see them. Making sheep cross a stream is a challenge. Once one goes in, the others push in pell-mell. Lake Tenaya was named for one of the chiefs of the Yosemite tribe. Sierra mosquitoes are nearly an inch long. Sierra chipmunks are arboreal and squirrel-like. Grouse and woodpeckers are abundant in the vicinity of Mount Hoffman.On August third Muir found Professor Butler, his teacher at the University of Wisconsin, because, sensing his presence, John Muir made inquiries at the only hotel in the area and was directed to go to the Vernal Falls. Professor Butler and his party were astonished that John Muir found them.In times of hunger the dogs, men, and sheep are confronted with lions, leopards, wolves, hyenas, and panthers. The names of places are exciting and descriptive--Moraine Lake, Mono Desert, Soda Springs, Unicorn Peak, Cathedral Range, Tuolumne, Hetch-Hetchy Valley. Muir's self-directed studies in botany clearly account for some of the strengths of this nature narrative. In the end Mr. Delaney tells Muir he will be famous some day.The author describes himself as an incredible wilderness lover. September twenty second ended Muir's first excursion.The book is a marvel. Sketches and photographs are included and enhance the work."},{"Title":"My first summer in the Sierra,","review":"'First Summer in the Sierra' is a classic among nature classics.

He wrote many books, includingJourneys in the Wilderness,The Mountains of California, etc. Muir's majestic, inspirational writing style is evident throughout this book, which was originally pubilshed in 1911.He wrote, \\"The whole landscape showed design, like man's noblest sculptures. How wonderful the power of its beauty! Gazing awestricken, I might have left everything for it.\\" (Pg. 14) Later, he says, \\"we can see into the lower end of the famous (Yosemite) valley, with its wondrous cliffs and groves, a grand page of mountain manuscript that I would gladly give my life to be able to read.\\" (Pg. 102)He observes about the twining lily, \\"Like most other things not apparently useful to man, it has few friends, and the blind question, 'Why was it made?' goes on and on with never a guess that first of all it might have been made for itself.\\" (Pg. 26) About butterflies, he says, \\"Regarded only as mechanical inventions, how wonderful they are! Compared with these, Godlike man's greatest machines are as nothing.\\" (Pg. 160)He effuses, \\"In the midst of such beauty, pierced with its rays, one's body is all one tingling palate. Who wouldn't be a mountaineer! Up here all the world's prizes seem nothing.\\" (Pg. 153) He suggests that \\"everything in Nature called destruction must be creation---a change from beauty to beauty.\\" (Pg. 229) He adds, \\"In our best times everthing turns into religion, all the world seems a church and the mountains altars.\\" (Pg. 250)The beauty and emotional content of Muir's writings are hardly matched by more recent writers; they are a wonderful legacy to treasure for all lovers of Nature."},{"Title":"My first summer in the Sierra,","review":"If we all loved God's country the way that John Muir did, it would be awesome.

Muir reluctantly dictated this book while walking around a northern California estate. The wealthy owner of the estate loaned his secretary while Muir walked and talked and the secretary took dictation. Muir had the benefit of good editors. It is a great read because Muir is walking through forests while he recounts his first summer in the Sierra Nevada. We feel it through his eyes.Muir's later writing efforts came hard, with much editing and rewrites. He worked in his \\"scribble den\\" in Martinez with \\"lateral, terminal and medial moraines of paper arranged about the room ready to cascade forth and bury him.\\"The original manuscripts show much of the book was written in pencil, with at least five editings (Muir made corrections and alterations). Graham cracker crumbs are embedded in the paper (Muir ate while he worked. Eating graham crackers is a carry over from his student days at the University of Wisconsin).This is the genuine John Muir, fresh, crisp, articulate (okay, his descriptions can be a bit wordy at times) and alive with a child-like fascintation for learning and inspiration.I own an original first edition copy with the dust cover and gold leaf on the hard bound cover. I reread the book from time to time.

It seems almost as if Muir wrote one page and repeated it 264 times. He wrote of nature's beauty and bounty when untouched. John Muir was a naturalist who lived from 1834-1914, beginning his life in Wisconsin and later moving to California to observe the beautiful sierra mountains. His intention in the writings were to inspire people, naturalists or not, to enjoy nature at its fullest and keep it that way. I think that this book was very repetitive, but the message was a positive and, to me, true one.The context of this book revolved around the idea of nature's true beauty and how it can exist freely. Muir spoke of the ecology of the Sierra. Nearly every page of the book had a new species of plant or animal that he had observed. He then told of what its affect on him was, whether it was annoying or satisfying, beautiful or ugly, natural or processed. In short, his main context was the loveliness he observed and wanted to share in his writings.John Muir stated \\"...Mr. Delaney, a sheep owner, for whom I had worked a few weeks, called on me, and offered to engage me to go with his shepherd and flock to the headwaters...\\" This was the beginning of his journey to the most beautiful place he could ever imagine, a place that he returned to for the rest of his life. Muir had a good companion, a St. Bernard named Carlo. The book went on to tell how him and a few others led 2050 sheep up the Sierra mountain range in California. They encountered many obstacles along the way. Some of these obstacles were bear attacks, to which Muir said, \\"Bears are slow and awkward with their eyes.\\" They went on camping at different sites, spending sometimes several weeks at one site. Here, Muir made endless amounts of sketches and recordings of his observations. The group faced a bread famine, the result of a slow and lazy Mr. Delaney, but recovered and returned to their trek with the sheep to the high mountains. John's helpful substance was tea. To another, tea was nothing and he needed tobacco. Everybody had something to keep them with it, so to say. The book did gain some excitement when Muir was sitting atop a mountain and had a sudden feeling that his old professor from Wisconsin was visiting. A few days later, he realized this was true and met up with him, speaking of old times and getting slumber in the hotel. Whenever John would observe tourists going through the mountains, he would shake his head at their ignorance to the size and beauty of the area. He just saw them looking at the ground, not fully enjoying it. Towards the end, John was sad to leave the mountains and return to the lowlands, farther away from the mountains he adored so much. He said \\"Now, however, I must turn toward the lowlands, praying and hoping Heaven will shove me back again.\\" He returned many times in his long life, and each visit was never a disappointment.The work that I read had very much information on the specifics of plants and animals found in the Sierra. I learned a lot about the sizes of these organisms and their characteristics. For example, there was a section where Muir wrote of how the ants were inches long and that they \\"check you out\\" before they have the colony attack you. If you are still and seem harmless, they will not bite, but a sudden move may jolt them to bite. He said that the bite from this species of ant felt like a terrible electric sting that nobody should have to endure more than once or twice in a lifetime. So these parts of the book were good because I found this activity quite interesting, but some parts, such as the tree descriptions, got boring. I am not interested in the texture and color of the tree bark. I can get the whole picture much easier. My own experiences tell me what nature is like, so I have a good feel of what Muir is trying to show us. The honors biology class has helped me by letting me know some of the ideas behind genus species names and writings, so that is how the course helped me out. That is what I thought of the book and why I thought that way. The only question I really had was why Muir described things so detailed and run-on and descriptive. I may have an idea, but I am not sure.I believe that John Muir described the organisms so in-depth because he wanted his audience to really be able to visualize it and the beauty it held in itself. This all fits in with the context of the environment's ecology being a precious thing that can not go to waste. So while it wasn't the most fun book to read, it still held an important message, as I have said before, that we must follow to keep the environment beautiful."},{"Title":"My first summer in the Sierra,","review":"I am going to resign from critiquing this book on a literary scale, and just say that I didn't enjoy this book for the same reason a couple others mentioned - its boring and repetitive. Maybe its because I'm not used to aimless - albeit eloquent -landscape descriptions, or maybe it's the fact that NOTHING happens for 264 pages, but reading this book felt more like a chore than an enjoyable reading experience. Case in point: Casual readers beware!"},{"Title":"My first summer in the Sierra,","review":"Muir tells a story of his journey into the Yosemite area in California as a shephard. While his journey encompasses other places, the story remains essentially the same since the entire book is filled with him talking about everything being so marvelous.Despite John Muir being very well known now to many people I'm left uncertain as to why this man should be one out of so many other 'mountain men' to become famous.His story is filled with rantings about finding different little animals such as squirrels, rabbits, and indians and then peppers each description of the animal with some bantering about whatever it is that he finds extraordinary about it, or whatever he thinks is extremely interesting, or by simply saying such and such is truly amazing.I did however enjoy the peripherial aspects of the book, such as Muir's growing insanity from being isolated in the woods for several months. He starts his journey talking about how he's heard stories of shepards gone mad and how he doesn't really believe he'll go insane. But near the middle of the book, he's put a personality to the plants...by the end, he's having in depth conversations with plants. Ha! It's almost worth reading just for noting little things like that.The book gets 3 stars, as opposed to 1 star, because Muir writes VERY eloquently and if you have an interest and a solid knowledge of plant and animal life and the terrian Muir is traveling, the book is relatively interesting."},{"Title":"Riding Freedom","review":"Riding Freedom is a great book about a girl who knew her own mind and had to make choices early in life to fulfill her dreams.

Throughout the book she tries to disguise herself as a boy, so she can work with horses.In the book we learned that freedom is never too far to grasp for a moment. We know this because throughout the book she runs away. She ran away from an orphanage and met a man. She believed this is her ticket to freedom.In the mid 1800's her ticket, a man named Ebeneezer gives her a chance to be free forever in Rhode Island.

Riding Freedom is an excellent book to read to elementary and middle school students. As a young girl, Charlotte, knew what she wanted to do with her life. Charlotte knew she wanted to work with horses and have her own ranch someday with her best friend Hay from the orphanage. Charlotte very much disliked the orphanage and Mr. Millshark, the owner, so she ran away. Charlotte had to disguise herself so no one would recognize her after she ran away. She dressed as a boy and became a stable boy to earn a place to sleep. While a stable boy, she learned how to drive a stagecoach and became the best driver anyone had ever seen. No one knew she was a woman, and if they did she would have never been able to live her dream. One of the best parts of the book is when Mr. Millshark rode with Charlotte in the stagecoach. He never knew it was her, so she had a good time making him miserable. I liked this book because of it's humorous and compassionate events. I could picture myself in those days struggling to get what I wanted, just like Charlotte. I could also vividly picture what Charlotte was seeing and doing. Charlotte was strong, smart, compassionate, brave, and followed through with her dreams. This book is a good read especially to those who love horses.

The illustrations are really good because it's really life like to history and Charlotte's life."},{"Title":"Riding Freedom","review":"My 9 year old son read this book, and so I read it, too, so we could discuss it together. It's a very engaging story. My son read it in a day - he couldn't put it down, and I found that I couldn't, either.There are some very good themes in this book -- the main character is very strong, determined, and survives despite having the odds stacked against her. One thing in particular that I liked is how she doesn't necessarily learn how to do new things with great speed -- but she keeps at it until she has learned a new skill, and is successful at it. I think this is a particularly good thing for children to read about. Not all skills are immediate, and working to achieve proficiency is worthwhile.Other major themes are the importance of voting, the rights of women, the ability of girls to learn to do jobs formerly considered only fit for boys, facing fears in order to overcome subjugation and make a better life for oneself, and growing up without parents. Slavery is touched on.This book lends itself to the discussion of any of these topics, and my son and I had some very good talks as a result.I did feel the story ended a little abruptly. I was completely unprepared for it to be over, I was hoping more would be explained, and I felt dissatisfied after finishing the book.I must say that I also felt a bit uncomfortable reading about the woman whom the story is actually based on. (She lived her life as a man, and it wasn't discovered until after her death that she was female.) While this book presents topics for children to discuss that are interesting and worthwhile, I don't know that all parents would feel that this book is appropriate for their children to read.I would suggest that parents read the back of the book first, before handing it to the children to read. Be prepared for some questions!"},{"Title":"Riding Freedom","review":"I give this book five stars because I think Riding Freedom is a good book. It was an encouraging book.

The book is about a girl's life as she becomes a young woman in the 1800's. Charlotte (the girl) was in the orphanage when she was a kid, because her parents died when she was only two years old. Charlotte's favorite horse, Freedom, died after a race that the two won. Then, Charlotte got banned from the stables and lost her best friend, Hayward. Since she was so miserable, she ran away diguised as a boy (named Charley) with the help of an elderly man named Vern, who worked at the stables in the orphanage. Charlotte then begins to work for a man named Embeezer. She cleaned the stalls and was a stage coach when she was only twelve. She had to work hard for food and shelter. Then, Embeezer, Charlotte, the other workers and horses moved to Rhode Island. Years later, she travelled to California to train horses as a stage coach. But when she was cleaning the hoof of a wild horse, he kicked her in the eye. Then someone took Charlotte to the hospital. She had lost all control of motion in her left eye (that the horse kicked), so she wore an eye patch. Since she had one good eye, all she was able to do was clean the stalls and feed the horses. She no was longer able to work with the wild horses or remain as a stage coach. But Charlotte had not lost hope. She started training two horses by herself, and then started training six horses. She wanted to prove to James (a stage coach at the stables) that she could train six horses, even with one good eye. And she did. So now, Charlotte was riding horses again. Then, one day, it was so stormy out, you couldn't even see the roads. However, she needed to take a group of people to another town. The other workers told it was too dangerous, but she promised that she would get them there safely. So Charlotte started off and came across a bridge. When she reached the bridge, Charlotte tested it to see how sturdy it was (not very). So, she escorted each person once at a time over the bridge until one stubborn man refused budge. Then, Charlotte said, \\"If you don't want to move, I'll just have to help you move, Sir.\\" Still grumbling, the man to the other side of the bridge. A few minutes later, Charlotte tried to ride the horses over the bridge, but right slab-dab in the middle of the bridge, Charlotte had a flashback of her mother and father dying, as well as the words they said before they died. Moments later, Charlotte zoned back to what was happening, trying not to fall off the bridge, into the rushing water. As soon at the back wheels touched the ground, the bridge collapsed. Everyone cheered and yelled, and the stubborn man said, \\"You saved my life.\\" After this, everyone heard about what Charlotte had done. They threw coins at her, in hopes that she would run over them. If she did, the thrower of the coin would have good luck. Later on, Charlotte was going to have a passenger who she despised, named Mr. Millshark. She hated him because he was the mean owner at the orphanage. He was the one who had banned her from the stables back at the orphanage. Then, Charlotte felt a \\"kiddish revenge\\" going through her body. Charlotte got the wagon stuck in a massive mud pit on purpose. And she then asked him if he would go in the mud and lift up part of the wagon so she could drive the horses to pull it out. But after he was done, she took his boots and hide them from him in order to give them to Embeezer. After she got the people to the stop, she went to look for private property and stables where she could live with Embeezer and her best friend Hayward. One night after she bought the property and house, she saw a sign that said PRIVATE PROPERTY. Then, she turned around and saw a young man petting Charlotte's kittens. She finally noticed, it was Hayward! Hayward stayed at the house for a couple of hours and then he left for a year. But he came back. Months later, Embeezer came to the house. Then, one of Charlotte's horses was going to have a baby. So Embeezer and Charlotte helped the horse give birth to the baby, but there wasn't just one. There were two! After giving birth to the babies, Charlotte and Embeezer found out that one was a girl (filly) and the other was a boy (colt). Finally, Charlotte decided on names for the two foals. The colt was named Vern's Pride and the filly was named Freedom."},{"Title":"Riding Freedom","review":"This is a fictional story based on the life of Charlotte Parkhurst, a stage coach driver who lived during the mid 1800s.In the story, Charlotte grew up as the only girl in a boy's orphanage where she constantly struggled for freedom and equality. She loved horses and spent every available minute either caring for them or riding them. Because she was a girl, she wasn't held to very high esteem by those around her. The feelings of the boys around her didn't matter as long as she was able to ride horses.When Charlotte faced the threat of losing the thing she loved most, she had to take action and decided to run away from the orphanage. She disguised herself as a boy in order to hide from the authorities and to obtain work on her own.Charolotte grew to become a legendary stagecoach driver. She was also the first woman to vote.My nine-year old daughter loved this book. She was so moved by this story, that she decided to do more research on Charlotte Parkhurst and write a report on her for school.I was moved by this story as well. It reminded me of how far women have come in the fight for equality."},{"Title":"Riding Freedom","review":"When Charley (the main character) was living miserably at the orphanage, she didnt't just give up. She ran away and found a job at something she loved to do, working with horses. I think she was brave and smart to make other people believe she was a man all her life. She has lots of adventures and works hard, and finally realizes her dream. Reading this book is a lot of fun, especially for people who love horses, or like reading about people who don't let bad things keep them from being happy."},{"Title":"Riding Freedom","review":"This book will capture the attention of boys and girls. It is a wonderful story about a young girl fighting to be herself despite the gender roles of her era. Lots of adventure and history are included in this captivating story. A must!"},{"Title":"Riding Freedom","review":"Riding freedom is a story about a girl named Charlotte who lives in an orphanage. She runs away and pretends to be a boy. After disguising herself as a boy she changes her name to Charley. She is chosen to drive stagecoaches and work at a barn. The main characters in this story are: Charlotte, Hayward, Mr. Millshark, Mr. Ebeneezer Vern and Mrs. Boyle. Once when Charlotte was driving a stagecoach a storm came right after she got across the bridge, it collapsed. This is an adventure for me.My favorite character is Hayward because he is so nice and considerate to everyone, especially Charlotte. He also tries to make Charlotte feel better when Freedom dies. I can relate to Hayward because he was made fun of for his big ears and have been made fun of before to. It made me feel very sad when Freedom died and I think if you read this story you may feel sad too. I liked this story because it made me feel like I could almost ride Freedom; the author is very descriptive.My favorite part was when Mr. Milshark asked to sit up in the front of the stagecoach and Charlotte said yes. Charlotte purposefully leads the stagecoach into the mud. She asks Mr. Millshark if he would try to get the coach out of mud. Mr. Millshark says yes so Charlotte tells Mr. Millshark to take off his boots. When Mr. Millshark is down in the mud working, Charlotte comes back up his boots are gone. I didn't like when Charlotte's parents died. Luckily Charlotte was thrown out of the stagecoach just as her parents were killed. I would recommend this book to kids who like heroes and adventure."},{"Title":"Riding Freedom","review":"This is a fine book, well-written, fast-paced, and presents an unconventional character and underlying case for women's rights without being preachy."},{"Title":"Riding Freedom","review":"Many books entertain, and many teach, but few can do both well. This outstanding book is one of the few.The main character is Charlotte Parkhurst. She grew up in an orphanage in New England during the late 1810's. She loved horses. Though she enjoyed working in the stables, she did not like having to work in the kitchen \\"where girls belonged\\". However, her troubles really started when she rode a sick horse in a race, when she thought he was okay. The horse later died. As a punishment, the owner of the orphanage said she could no longer visit the stables. Heartbroken, Charlotte decided to run away, disguised as a boy.She found a job in a stagecoach company's stable, where she took care of horses and drove stagecoaches. When two other workers in the stable decided to move to California and open their own stagecoach company, Charlotte went with them. When she got there, a number of wild horses that were going to be stagecoach horses had to be shoed. Charlotte was trying to shoe one when it kicked her in the eye. Consequently, she went blind in her eye.After her accident, the owners of the new stagecoach company refused to let her drive their stagecoaches. But the determined Charlotte practiced for months, then persuaded her boss to let her try driving just one stagecoach. Though it was foggy and raining, Charlotte was able to drive well, because she had learned to tell what road she was on from the sound of the horses' hooves. When she reached a dangerous bridge, she forced her passengers to get out of the coach and go across the bridge before her. She came after them, driving the stagecoach. When she reached the other side, the bridge broke. The passengers realized that Charlotte had saved their lives. Afterwards, she became famous in that area as \\"One-Eyed Charley\\" who could drive a stagecoach over a gold piece using only \\"his\\" good eye.When she was fifty-five, Charlotte, still disguised as a man, voted for the President in a small town in California. She was the first woman to vote in the United States, and that was before the amendment to the Constitution that allowed woman to vote. You'll have to read this amazing book to find out how Charlotte's lifelong dream came true, though.Ryan did an excellent job of masterfully mixing pleasure and information into an exciting book. I was surprised to find out that this masterpiece was her first novel. I highly recommend this book to anyone wishing a fresh, pleasurable read."},{"Title":"Riding Freedom","review":"What a fabulous character Ryan has put into words in this kid's novel of the life of Charlotte \\"Charley\\" Parkhurst!

She chose to live her whole life as a man -- the \\"Mountain Charley\\" of California lore -- which either speaks to her inner strength or to the contortions she had to endure to survive in late-1800's America. Whichever it is, Pam Munoz Ryan doesn't \\"take sides\\", but weaves an engaging story of a girl who loves horses, the people who befriended and helped her, the difficulties she faced, and the amazing events of her life.My 10-year-old son got this book at an event where he met illustrator Brian Selznick, but hadn't read it until he picked it for a book report this week. What a fine choice it turned out to be. After he read it (much of it aloud to his mom), we all became interested in the true history of Charlotte \\"Charley\\" Darkey Parkhurst. It turns out that he spent the last days of his life not too far from us on what is now Freedom Boulevard in Santa Cruz County, CA.

Reading a story that had real people made the story more captivating. It made me feel like the events of the past came to life.

It inspirational to me because of the main characters triumph over a corrupt country, and also because she controlled her own place in life. She also had the courage to do so when she was young and inexperienced. The story made up about this girl though is almost too amazing. Of course i understand that dreams can take you a very long way. But to be the first woman voter , have your own dream ranch , and be able to work at what you love almost brings out the truth of this book. The fact that it is a fictional book.I did like the book, but i thought that the plot was to much along the lines of a fairy tale. She was brought up in an orphanage as the only girl besides the cook, lost an eye, and should not by rights been able to do the things that she did. Charlotte got everything she dreamed of.

This authors writing,Riding Freedom, is a timeless tale that flows into the means of goals and the strain to accomplishing them.Made an orphan by a tragic accident, Charlotte Parkhurst lives in a world filled with privilege and wild days. Charlotte was born and now proudly owns a unique talent for taming horses, but after ten years of this life in addition to a horrid loss, she yearns for what lies beyond the orphanage. Her role as a mere female has somewhat limited her and her dreams. So she devises a clever plan to be free. As this character puts it, \\"I... I need... a pair of scissors.\\" Scissors? Scissors for some master plan? What could scissors do? How could they help? They cut hair of course. And girl's hair can be awfully long, but if it's short, you can look amazingly like a boy...In her discrete disguise, she runs away to the northern state of Massachusetts. Led by fate and destiny, she meets the man Ebeneezer. Under his talented wings, her almost abnormal skill with horses is sharpened. She learns and her life continues with a slight ease. Despite this, Charlotte, now Charley to the public, shakes hands unreadily with tragedy.

But how far into her new methods of existing will she go until her world is destroyed by her new weakness? Will she be forced back to the orphanage? And what goals can she achieve to win her destiny?Pam Munoz Ryan is a profound author and has written many other stories besides Riding Freedom. Her works have received several awards.

She writes most of her books for young adults. The book Riding Freedom won the national willa Cather award. Pam wrote Riding Freedom as a realistic fiction book. Th major theme throughout this book is freedom is never too far to grasp. She ran away and got a boy disguise just so she could be with horses. That was freedom for Charlotte. In mid 1800's there was a girl named charlotte Parkhurst. She was an orphan because her parents died in a wagon accident. Luckily she was thrown and brought to safety. \\"Kirkus says that this story flows along effortlessly\\". He thinks Riding Freedom is credible and entertaining.Brian selnick the illustrator shows a great illustration on the front cover. This picture relates to the story because there's a picture of charlotte and her horse called Freedom. Pam Ryan connects pictures to words in her book Riding freedom.Charlotte wasn't like most girls her age. She had wild hairspring out of her brown braids. She wore a ribbon tied around her waist. Ebeneezar Balch was one of the major characters throughout this book. Charlotte lived temporally in ebeneezars barn. Charlotte was to work for him everyday. Then there was Mr. Millshark.

The other event was that she wantedto run away from the orphanage.I think she should't run away because she will get caught sooner or later. Then she will have to stay at the orphanage past sixteen. She had never got adopted because Mrs.Williams and Mr. Boyle would tell people it's there neice. I don't know whty they would do that for.In this story there are many main characters Charoltte and Hayword were best friends in the orphanage. Williams is aboy that hated them two for every single thing. Mrs.Willams was the supervisorand Mr.Boyle was the person in charge of everything ther. Vern was the person who had to take care of the horses there. Also there is Freedom whom was the the horse Charltte rode in races. The problem was that Charltte wanted to runb away with Hayword gotten adopted. So there plans where more difficult they had seemed.After Hayword got adopted Charltte ran away and took a pair of scissors and cut her hair like a boy's hair. She went to a river and took her clothes and put on boy clothes. She put her old clothes in the river so when people came looking for her they would think she had drowned.

The really cool thing I like about the book is that Charlotte changed her name to Charlie so when she voted no one knew that she really was a she. It turns out that she was the first woman to vote before any other woman. Riding Freedom is one of the most fasinating book I have ever read."},{"Title":"Riding Freedom","review":"Riding FreedomATTENTION ALL HORSE LOVERS!!!!!Riding Freedom is about a girl named Charlotte that is a orphan that is at a boy orphanage.But that doesn't bother her a bit!

I finished it within three hours because I too couldn't put it down. The author pulled me completely into Charlotte's world and I felt her joy, sorrow and anger.

She gets teased.\\"In the mid-eighteen hundreds, when the East was young and the West was yet to be settled, a baby was born, named Charlotte. When she was nothing more than a bundle, she surprised her parents and puzzled the doctor by surviving several fevers. Folks said that any other baby would have died, but Charlotte was already strong. She walked before most babies crawled. She talked before most babies babbled, and she never cried. Unless someone took something away from her.\\"Riding Freedom is a fictional biography about a girl, Charlotte Parkhurst, who was an orphan. She was taken to a boys orphanage because there were no girls orphanages back then. She had to do many chores because she was the only girl there, apart from the cook. She always got back at the boys for teasing her though because every Saturday there would be a horse race at the orphanage and no matter what, Charlotte won the race. Charlotte loved horses. Her favorite horse at the orphanage was called Freedom. Charlotte liked her life at the orphanage until something bad happened to Freedom. The story goes on to describe Charlotte's life at the orphanage and then as she grows up.The book is full of exciting and unexpected events that keeps the reader wanting to keep on reading.

It is about a girl named Charlotte Parkhurst going out to make her dream of living in a big house on a big ranch come true. This is not only a great book but it has historical facts. I think kids around 5 and up would like this book. This story is about a girl who pretended to be a boy all her life, that's why nobody knew she was a woman. She was the first woman to vote.

Running away from the orphanage changes Charlotte's life from cooking and slaving away in the kitchen in a boy's orphanage to running and pretending she is the new kid in town who says his name is Charley.Charlotte loses her parents in the first few years of her life and turns out tougher than most boys. She has to work in the kitchen in a boy's orphanage run by a hateful and uncaring man named Mr. Milshark.Charlotte loves horses more than anything else in the world. Ever since she learned how to ride a horse she wanted to run away from the awful orphanage and earn enough money to buy land and start a ranch with her younger friend Hayward, At the orphanage she only has two friends, other than the horses. Vern, the watcher of the stables, and Hayward, a younger boy who is kind of a tag-along.After Charlotte runs away from the orphanage she makes some new friends. The first person who helps her is a man named Ebenezer, a stock tender who keeps her secret and teaches her to drive a six-horse team. Years later she joins some friends in California and finds some property that could be hers.I was reading Riding Freedom in a book group with some of my friends and each day we could only read to a certain chapter. I think it was most difficult to only read to that chapter because this book is so good I didn't want to stop reading. Once you pick this book up you won't be able to set it down.Riding Freedom is partly sad but mostly exciting. It has a lot of adventure in it and will suck you into the pages. Charlotte's story is based on something that really happened in early California history. This book is good for all ages, but would be highly recommended for 4th to 7th grade."},{"Title":"Riding Freedom","review":"RIDING FREEDOM is a very good book!

They were sent there because her parents had died in a stage coach crash during a storm, and nobody wanted to take her in. She lived with her friend Howard, a boy much younger than her. She always visits Vern and his horse stables which houses her favorite horse, Freedom. She always raced with William, a boy who always bullied her, and she always won. She spent most of the day assisting the orphanage cook, Mrs. Boyle, who yelled at her for the littlest things. Suddenly, three tragical things happened at once. Freedom, her favorite horse, died, she wasn't allowed in the stables anymore, and Hayward was getting adoptedCharllote was so frustrated that she decided to run away. She asked Vern for stage coach money and asked Hayward for his clothes before he got adopted. After he was adopted, she went on her way to the nearest stage coach station.She was seated between two plump women who asked for her name. She called herself Charlie, and she soon fell asleep. When she woke up, she was way past her stop, Concord. She got off immediatley, and she found a horse stable to hide out in. She hid in the swtable and slept there for three days until the stage-coach driver found out. Charllote asked for a job, and she became a stable-cleaner.After a while, she became a stage coach driver who drove a four-horse coach but later went on to a six-horse coach. She drove folks all over town, and she became popular. She moved on to California, and her reputation grew there, too. Once, while she was trying to tame a wild horse, she got kicked in the eye. She became blind in that eye, and people referred to her as one-eyed Charlie. She soon owned a property, a ranch with a horse. Once, Hayward met her as a grown young man, and he told her of his life. They stayed together but seperated once more, and Charllote tended the ranch. Her horse gave two foals, and Charllote named one Vern's Thunder and the other Freedom.I think that this book is exciting and adventurous, especially for a girl. This book really fascinates me about what a girl could do, and how she fearlessly disguised herself as a boy and encountered many dangers. I enjoyed this book very much, and everything that Charllote did amazes me."},{"Title":"Riding Freedom","review":"This book is my absolute favorite.

Or have they all been incredibly boring? Riding Freedom was a very exciting adventure story based on a true event. You will most definitely fall in love with this story and not fall asleep. Most of the time you think of history as being very dull and boring but when Pam Ryan tells history, it is a different story.Riding Freedom is the story of a teenage girl named Charlotte who became an orphan at a very young age and has lived in an orphanage for many years where she is the only girl. No one wanted to adopt a girl because they thought that young ladies could not do field work or other things around the house. So Charlotte is stuck in the kitchen helping the cook do chores. One thing about Charlotte is that she has always loved and cared for horses and is very good with them, too. She rides very well and many boys dislike her for her riding abilities. One day Charlotte receives bad news from several different friends and is forced to change her life or be stuck doing chores for an overweight cook forever ."},{"Title":"Riding Freedom","review":"This is one of the greatest horse stories I have ever read!

Working as a stable boy then a coach driver Charley (Charlotte) works towards her dream. To have a ranch of her own far from the orphange. She goes to Californa because coach drivers were needed.

Any horse lovers should read this book!"},{"Title":"Riding Freedom","review":"I recommend this book to anyone who likes to read because it tells about friendship and it has to do with things that happened back a long time ago. It was a very interesting book and a good story about friends and how they come together once again. Charlotte and Hay were friends and then drift apart and eventually find each other. The friendship they first had is redeveloped again. This is a good example of a lasting friendship as Charlotte said, \\" Good-bye Hay. I'll find you. We're gonna have a ranch, remember? With a big ol' sign that says Private Property. Remember?\\" Another example is when charlotte was talking to Vern and didn't want to run away from the orphanage because she thought she would be loosing a great friend. \\"I won't forget you Vern.\\" I also learned that when Charlotte got her own place she got to see her best friend again because he came to live with her.

She then goes with two young men to a new land to seek better business and land for herself. She finds her land and buys it.

I remember that there was mild critical disappointment when these collections first appeared. The problem was not with the quality of the stories-- which were quite good-- but over the fact that most of them were \\"recycled Bradbury\\". That is, they were tales that had been previously published in other collections. Nowadays, this doesn't seem to be an issue of great importance.\\"The Pedestrian\\" is here, one of Bradbury's best. It's the short, tight little gem about the last pedestrian who one night encounters the last police car. The world of this story, with shadowy figures glued to their television sets, is the world of _Fahrenheit 451_ (1953). The story was first published in _The Reporter_, a news weekly that deserved a longer life than it had.\\"Pillar of Fire\\" is a novelette length manic tribute to Edgar Alan Poe and fantastic Romanticism. A hate-filled madman rises from the dead and wreaks havoc on a rational, ordered, emotionless society. Ask yourself with whom you identify.\\"The Man\\" is the one about the spaceship captain searching from planet to planet for the second coming of Christ. James Blish (1964) pointed out a theological flaw in the story. An omnipotent God could arrange for a second coming simultaneously on all planets without requiring His Messiah to travel from one planet to another by rocket. But I think that Bradbury's main point still stands: There will always be people who are looking for a grail over the next horizon.There are two stories from _The Martian Chronicles_ (1950): \\"Dark They Were, and Golden-Eyed,\\" about the Earth colonists who go native; and \\"The Million Year Picnic,\\" about a family's encounter with the \\"new Martians\\" that closes the chronicles.Bradbury has a love-hate relationship with flying machines, and this is demonstrated in two fables: \\"Icarus Montgolfier Wright\\" and \\"The Flying Machine\\". The first was made into an excellent short movie animated by Joseph Mugnaini and narrated by Ross Martin.When I was in high school, a classmate of mine was nicknamed (for reasons that I have long since forgotten) The Fungus. When he entered a room, he would cheerfully say, \\"There's a fungus amungus\\". \\"Come Into My Cellar\\" is a story about fungi. They may be among us even now.Other stories include \\"Crysalis,\\" one of Bradbury's earliest solo stories (his very earliest pieces were colaborations); \\"Time in Thy Flight,\\" a reflection of Bradbury's love of Halloween; \\"The Smile,\\" a nod to Leonardo da Vinci and a savage attack against American anti-intellectualism; and \\"The Trolley,\\" an exercise in nostalgia. Here in Chattanooga, there are still places where we have tracks where the old trolley cars used to run. Every so often, somebody talks about bringing them back. But so far, nothing much has come of it. Too expensive. The economy won't allow it. We'd have to raise taxes. Maybe next year, you betcha.These are stories representing Bradbury at his best. Many of his later tales would have the style and the sentiment as these-- but not quite the same substance or sparkle._Reference_: Blish, James. \\"Cathedrals in Space\\". In _The Issue at Hand_. Chicago: Advent, 1964, 57-58."},{"Title":"S is for Space","review":"I'll start with mentioning a couple forms of reading I sometimes do NOT like. I sometimes don't like short story collections that are written in a fashion requiring excessive reader \\"work\\" in constructing the environment. You figure out what's going on . . . and it's over and time to start the next story (I know this sounds lazy, but I do often read for relaxation). And, I sometimes do not enjoy science-fiction that is overly technical, or overwhelms me with bizarre foreign names, terms, and political systems. This book is none of the above.This is a wonderful collection of easy reading and imaginative sci-fi short stories. Fit for readers of any age, it is the kind of stuff that makes one hunger for more science fiction (or more Ray Bradbury, anyway).I found myself looking forward to the world to be found in each successive story, and certainly was saddened to reach the end of the short book.There is a sister work, \\"R is for Rocket\\", which is more of the same good stuff.I promise you'll enjoy this."},{"Title":"S is for Space","review":"I believe that S is for Space is THE best book I have ever read.

This particular copy arrived in very good condition; I would say better than as described, considering the age of this edition.

Zero Hour is the tale that made the most impact on me and I still re-visit the story and stories in this wonderful book today."},{"Title":"S is for Space","review":"Viewed in the context of modern sci-fi, there's something almost childlike about Ray Bradbury's stories. They are so important and brilliant and fundamental that they've acquired the strength and power of fairy tales: something so central to the future development of narrative fiction that they MUST be reckoned with. \\"S is for Space\\" is my favorite of his collections, but they all have stories to make you smack your forehead from feelings of inadequacy."},{"Title":"S is for Space","review":"\\"S is for Space\\" by Ray Bradbury, 1966This is a nice collection of stories. Like \\"Dandelion Wine,\\" these are not 'science fiction' stories herein, or rather some are, some are not. It is interesting how he seems to use phrases that sound so elegant, but after reading different ones for the third or fourth time in different stories, you get to expect them and are not so interesting, more, \\"ho, hum, here's another.\\"'Chrysalis' - Poor Smith has become a chrysalis. Rockwell has been taking care of him and dimly understands what is happening. Hartley has been around, but is not happy about it. Smith scares him as some sort of unknown, or just something that could take over the world with out much trouble. In the end they are both right and Smith just goes somewhere else.'Pillar of Fire' - This is the oddest story in this book. A fellow come back to life and goes on a killing spree because he can and it just makes him mad that in the future world he has come to, death is not a problem. Seemingly, people in this future world, are not bothered by dieing, nor by others dieing. No one gets upset that Lantry is killing any number of people for no good reason and wholesale at that. In the end he is barely found out, and reasonably, there being not much a society can do to punish a dead man, they just put back to being dead.'Zero Hour' - The invasion is coming. The children are playing at something they do not understand. The parents get the idea too late.'The Man' - Christ has come again to some other world. Captain Hart has landed on a new planet, looking for some business for his profit. He gets confused with who has been here before him, by a few days. He thought it was some competitor or other, but as they land later on dead or hurt, it could not have been them, so who had been there? He aims to find out somehow or other. Some of his crew decide to stay and he goes off. The oddest part is the civilized way he tries to get the information he wants, no torture or beatings, just questions and answers, and wailing that he is not getting anywhere. Than, when his crew abandons his ship, he just says, \\"Okay, bye.\\"'Time in Thy Flight' - A school trip gone bad. The kids travel back in time to 1928 and do not want to leave. Maybe improvement is not really an improvement.'The Pedestrian' - Mr. Leonard Mead likes to go for walks, but he is the only one in this future world who does. He gets picked up by the automated cops for not being normal.'Hail and Farewell' - Willie is an odd boy of twelve or so. He does not age. After staying for a couple, three years, folks start to talk and wonder about him. He moves on to another town, to another pair, or person, for parents who would like to have him as their own. He gives comfort and love to those who have not had their own children. They give him a place to stay.'Invisible Boy' - Old Lady is a witch who can not do any tricks. Charlie is a little boy she would like to keep her company, but he wants to go home. He does get away, and she is sad.'Come Into My Cellar' - An odd fungus is going to take over the world, maybe.'The Million Year Picnic' - A fantasy of living on Mars. A young family takes a trip, actually the last trip made to Mars from Earth, for a picnic. But in the first couple of days there, the Earth becomes unreachable because of some war or cataclysm. They are stuck on Mars for the foreseeable future. This is no surprise to the parents. The children are amenable to staying, though they do wonder about what has happened to Earth. This is an odd story of hope and moving on and the destruction of the world.'The Screaming Woman' - This is a detective story. A little girl hears a woman screaming from under ground. Apparently her father and anyone else around there does not hear the screaming as well, wrong time to be listening or something. She goes around to find out whose wife is missing and finds that out, but still no one is trying to help her get this screaming woman out of the ground. The last thing is the woman sings a song only this little girls dad knows. Finally, he goes to help her dig up the woman and solve the mystery.'The Smile' - In the future, people will be mad about how the past has bought them to such a poor present and they take it out on remnants and artifacts from the past. They destroy what reminds them of a glorious past.'Dark They Were, and Golden-Eyed' - Another Mars settlement story. The settlers explore and live and become Martians. Eventually they 'channel' old Martian knowledge: names of places and things; and grow to look like Martians.'The Trolley' - A nostalgic story of a trolley that was being replaced. The trolley picks up kids on the way to a picnic, to relive the days of old glory when people used the trolley to get to the park for holidays or weekend outings, on last time.'The Flying Machine' - Military fear of new innovations in old China.'Icarus Montgolfier Wright' - It is amazing what some people can get published. This is something that seems to be about flying, but it gets all wrapped up in one person who gives the story it's name."},{"Title":"Utopian Legacies: A History of Conquest and Oppression in the Western World","review":"Rather than argue with the Christian semanticist reviewer, let me say that I found compelling Mohawk's premise and evidence that our most vicious behaviors, from ethnic cleansing to enslavement and genocide are often deeply rooted in the highest aspirations of the Western world.Of course this book was written before the onslaught of the recent spate of Muslim, Christian, Sikh, and state terrorism, so we cannot limit vicious behavior to the West. The issue is who is it who defines \\"highest\\" and what do they do as a result.Utopianism may refer literally to the absence of all conflict, peaceful co-existence and so on, but human beings are human beings and when utopianism takes hold, true believers are either spat upon or spit upon those outside themselves. On the positive side we have the Oneidans, the Shakers, and other such peaceable groups, many quite small and short-lived, although that is certainly not always the case. On the other side, we have many historical horrors.From the Puritan's (and Ronald Reagan's) \\"Shining City on the Hill\\" to Hitler's Aryan nation to the Crusaders' \\"salvation\\" of Jerusalem (the original 'shining city on the hill'), to the Muslim vision of paradise, to the apocalyptic vision of the \\"Rapture\\" -- wherever a powerful sense of exclusive idealism, religious or not, has taken root, believers frequently have behaved savagely toward those they deem \\"not worthy\\" of experiencing that ideal.These \\"others,\\" whether Jew or Christian, Hugenot, Hindus, Muslim, black, women or indigenous peoples of colonized lands, have been systematically and often brutally excluded from experiencing idealized human and religious glory both in concept and in fact.It is in his description of this process as it regards native peoples that Ifound Mohawk's book an excellent, if disturbing read."},{"Title":"Utopian Legacies: A History of Conquest and Oppression in the Western World","review":"I have to disagree with the previous review. Although Christianity, in theory, may not carry a utopian view, it certainly conducts itself thusly. This book targets many important issues and explains the many \\"whys\\" associated with our history. It is an important contribution to anyone's collection of Native American history. It outlines quite clearly how objectives based on religious beliefs often foil themselves and result instead in calamitous outcomes."},{"Title":"Utopian Legacies: A History of Conquest and Oppression in the Western World","review":"I greatly looked forward to this book but couldn't have been more disappointed. The author correctly identifies Utopianism, the belief we live in a perfectable world, as the dominant source of mischief and tragedy throughout history.Utopian zeal shapes nations, political parties, education, law and people's lives, on a moment to moment basis. From Darwin to Marx to Freud to Stalin to Hitler to the 60's culture to modern hate groups, socialists and activists. All these things share the belief humans can &quot;progress&quot; to a perfect world.The book's failure is in identifying Christianity as Utopian when it has actually been the primary force opposing Utopian impulses throughout history. I don't know where the author could have gotten his understanding of Christianity (or history), but &quot;The Kingdom of God&quot; he describes Christians as referring to is something to be established by God, not people.Because of the existence of sin (specifically, Original Sin), Christians recognize no human action can possibly create Utopia. We do not live in a perfectable world. Christians see human thought as being so corrupted by sin, people cannot even IMAGINE a perfect world. All attempts will lead to ruin. Further, Christians view the Utopian impulse of humanity as evidence of and reflecting the desire of a fallen mankind to return to fellowship with God in the Garden of Eden -- something no human action can bring about, only the Grace of God.Thus, Christians, and those operating under Christian thinking, have been the historical force OPPOSING Utopianism. The author's scholarship and understanding is so wrong, he misidentifies the only historical solution to the problem he is talking about.[The Puritan intent to set up an example of a shining &quot;city on the hill&quot; wasn't Utopian -- no group was more conscious on a moment-to-moment basis of the unavoidability of sin than Puritans -- but rather a demonstration of what could be done when adhering to God's given laws for a fallen, corrupt people]Recently, Utopian idealism, the denial of human sin, has been reformulated on the assertion humans are only mechanically derived animals; complicated bits of matter to be manipulated to a higher state by an elite which believes it has higher vision (replacing God with their own desires).Modernity is Utopianism, made scientifically plausible by Darwin whose Victorian-era studies seemed to eliminate God, thus Original Sin. The result was predicted and predictable (by Christians): Karl Marx quickly folded Darwin's science into communism and the attempt to perfect human nature scientifically, to create a Worker's Paradise (60 million killed in Russia, 50 million killed in China). Then the Nazi's (National Socialists) trying to create an Aryan super-race, also based on the science of Darwin (20 million dead &amp; Holocaust). And eugenics and abortion: the modern world.Utopianism, rationalized as science, has killed 200+ million and enslaved billions in the great secular socialist states we live in. This is why Christians advocate decentralization of power; to avoid its concentration in the hands of corrupt humans. And why the Utopians seek to centralize it, so the elite can shepherd us to Utopia. The modern Left are INTERNATIONAL Utopians while the Right are NATIONALISTIC Utopians (my country, my race). Same thought process, different implementation. Christians oppose them both; WW II, Cold War, etc.The author barely discusses socialism and Marxism while attacking Christianity. For this reason, the author's error makes the book perverse. Wrong history, wrong analysis, wrong conclusions. Just wrong."},{"Title":"Education: Opposing Viewpoints","review":"For a book less than two hundred pages long, this took me a long time to finish (and not only because I mislaid it for two weeks). The subject is interesting and relevant, and each viewpoint is short enough to finish easily in one sitting. But as with the previous book that I read in this Opposing Viewpoints series (on Islam), I felt that the viewpoints were addressing various aspects of the issue without answering the points made by other writers.Partly that is a result of these books being compiled from previously written materials, rather than essays written for the purpose of the book. The best books I have read that present opposing viewpoints allow each author to directly address the points made by other authors in the same volume - and better yet, to respond to their responses. One article did directly criticize the views expressed in the previous one, which had been written by then-President Clinton and was no doubt widely distributted. But its objection was that too many people would jump on what Clinton said to do without noting that he said one had to go about it the right way.That probably applies to just about everything written on the subject of education, and accounts for a great many of the problems in the system at all levels. It is folly to take any one recommendation about education and try to apply it across the board, without consideration for how it will work out in a specific situation, and often without heeding the cautions that accompanied the initial recommendation. The best piece in the book, I think, is one that emphasizes the need for each local community to have authority for and take responsibility for implementing educational programs that meet their needs and their goals. That author also stressed that it is a long, difficult process, with no quick or easy fixes.There are some places where bilingual education is done well (as one essay points out). One of them happens to be in a community near ours, where elementary students (whose parents choose to have them participate in this program) learn to be fully bilingual, regardless of whether their first language is English or Spanish. Other bilingual programs have been found to be dismal failures (as another essay emphasizes in arguing against the concept). It is a mistake to say that bilingual education is best based on the success in West Liberty. But it is even more mistaken to say that the whole idea is flawed because of the places where it has been done so badly.There are schools that shy away from rote memorization because they want students to learn to think rather than just regurgitate facts. There are schools that react to that by making rote memorization a focus of their programs. But good teachers have always known that it is a necessary part, but only a part, of the learning process. There are any number of good ideas that people latch onto as the answer to problems in our schools, but none of the ideas are capable, in themselves, of fixing what is broken.Some communities provide an excellent education and spend a lot of money on it. Some communities have a very small budget and do very poorly. There is ample evidence that merely spending more does not guarantee a successful program. But those wealthy communities that do have good schools would hardly want to slash their spending, because money does help - when the rest of the pieces are also in place.Those pieces include parental involvement (the biggest factor), community support, competent and caring teachers, and effective discipline. Trying to fix only one of those areas may bring improvement, but only to a limited degree. No amount of money, standards/testing, or models of what has worked elsewhere will work without those essential components. (In the case of private schools, community support is not an issue, but public schools, by definition, depend on it.)Reading all the viewpoints will give a good idea of some things that work, and the folly of simply trying to export ideas and programs from one place to another without getting the foundation right first."},{"Title":"Education: Opposing Viewpoints","review":"I used this book on my college research paper for Government, and it practically wrote the paper for me!

Phyllis Brighton tells Shayne that she is getting crazy and that she will kill her own mother. Shayne visits the Brighton house at that night, but Phyllis's mother is already killed. And what is worse, Phyllis's hands and clothes are red in blood...This is definitely one of the best Shayne mysteries. The story is very well-plotted and it harmoniously contains many elements; fair-play detection, psycho-suspense, humor, hard-boiled violence and romance. And Michael Shayne is very attractive. He is a tough and ruthless guy, but humane and decent at heart. I particularly like the way he treats Phyllis. He does everything he can to help her, even breaking the law."},{"Title":"Ghostlight","review":"I have to agree with the previous reviewer. This book was quite boring and there was no real action until the end...and even that wasn't great.If this is the first time you've read anything by Marion Zimmer Bradley, don't let it keep you from reading her other books--Mists of Avalon was one of the best books I ever read."},{"Title":"Ghostlight","review":"On Beltane Eve 1969, Truth Jourdemayne became an orphan when her mother died and her father disappeared while performing a magickal ritual. It is now 25 years later, and as Samhain Eve approaches, Truth finds herself in her father's Hudson Valley mansion, where a group of initiates are trying to re-create that same failed rite. Stranger and stranger things begin to happen around the house, is it haunted or is it caused by the macigkal dabbling of the inhabitants?Black magic, haunted mansion, sounds interesting, right? Wrong.I feel awful saying this because I love Bradley's Darkover novels, but I couldn't even finish this horrible book. It was BORING, ssllooooowwww, and the character development virtually nonexistent."},{"Title":"Ghostlight","review":"I've read everything this wonderful lady has written.OK, I might have missed ONE. Ghostlight is a spiritualadventure involving the gates between worlds - only thistime the gate is on Planet Earth! The heroine is unaware ofher personal powers until it's almost too late.

Well worth the money even ifyou're not familiar with her works."},{"Title":"Ghostlight","review":"Marion Zimmer Bradley masterfully develops the mystery and suspense in this believable tale of Truth and her quest to uncover her past. Truth is a strong, intelligent female character and a refreshing change from the frail, helpless \\"heroines\\" in many modern novels. The scenes are vivid, and the characters deep. Ghostlight will keep you on the edge of your seat until the very end. As Truth discovers, it is our choices which determine who we are, not destiny."},{"Title":"Ghostlight","review":"This book was really amazing in the true Marion Zimmer Bradley fashion. She uses such vivid imagery in all of her books that the characters and scenery come alive. I had scenes from the book stuck in my head for days as if it were a movie. I've also read Gravelight, which I thought was better quality, but this was definitely a thriller."},{"Title":"Ghostlight","review":"What can I say- I loved this book! It was one of those books I just couldn't put down. Marion Zimmer Bradley's detailed descriptions make you feel that you're really there. The characterizations are so deep and realistic, and the plot is a definite page turner. This was the first Bradley novel I had read and it has inspired me to read many more. Though the events of the story are definitly not the kind of thing that tends to happen every day the book portrays them so realisticly that you almost belive that they could. I would make a definite recommendation of this book to anyone who enjoys fantasy novels or books that are intensly descriptive."},{"Title":"Ghostlight","review":"I enjoyed Ghostlight very much...but I enjoyed reading Heartlight, which was written later but set earlier (a common occurance in MZB books, I think !) even more so ! I think that I would have enjoyed Ghostlight even more if I'd known 'the rest of the story' as ahead of time. As with all the books in this series, you must feel comfortable with MZB's acceptance and usage of occult terms. Overall, this is a page turner of a book, a wonderful read for a 'cozy night' and gives the reader food for thought regarding the occult world."},{"Title":"Ghostlight","review":"Usually when Marion Zimmer Bradley is mentioned most people think of MISTS OF AVALON, fans of her work may also think of other books in that trilogy or perhaps in the prequels set in Atlantis. The 'Light' series, of which GHOSTLIGHT is the first is set in the modern day and concern Truth Jourdemayne, a researcher at an institute investigating the paranormal. It sounds so exotic but Truth is not a field researcher tracking down ghosts or even one of those who interview and evaluate would be psychics. Truth's specialty is statistics, she does the necessary but tedious work of establishing whether or not the findings of her colleagues is anything truly out of the ordinary. An unusual occupation for a young woman, particularly for the daughter of one of the most infamous men in the occult world. He at least he was twenty years ago when he disappeared after her mother's mysterious death.Truth had spent her life avoiding everything about her father, but when her aunt gave her information that set her digging into her father's life, back at the estate where her mother was killed. While there Truth was drawn back into her heritage, a heritage that might go back much further than Truth had ever imagined.Fans of MISTS OF AVALON might be a bit disappointed in this series. Bradley does a much better job of bringing characters from the distant past to life than she does with those in the present. Truth is not nearly as strong a character as Morgaine from the 'Avalon' books or even the sisters from the 'Atlantis' series. Still, Bradley at less than her best is still better than most. The premise of this series is imaginative, the plot full of twists that will keep the reader guessing until the final pages and eager to pick up the next in the series, WITCHLIGHT."},{"Title":"Ghostlight","review":"Whelp, it seems that MZB will be wallowing in the reputation of Mists of Avalon for the rest of her career. I must confess that I stayed up until 6 am to finish reading this book - and I was greatly disappointed. This is standard MZB self discovery crap, with a few standard fantasy elements thrown in for good measure. Vague Arthurian mentions, Aes Sidhe connections and lost magic all mixed together with pseudo parapsychology and ghost appearances to hook the reader. If you enjoy cheap horror novels, this book might be a bit of a lark"},{"Title":"Ghostlight","review":"Very good atmosphere, but a few too many jokes at the genre's expense that fell flat. The radical empiricist confronted by the paranormal made me, at times, scream &quot;Scully&quot; to myself. But the complete plot collapse at the climax really hurts this book. If her writing is deft in MISTS OF AVALON, a gentle tour director directing the eye towards all the best parts, she stumbles at points here, resorting to some awkward hand waving at points. At any rate, it was entertaining if occasionally annoying."},{"Title":"Ghostlight","review":"Marion Zimmer Baradley once rejected a story I submitted to her magazine on the basis that it was too occult. After reading two of the books from the **Light series I am convinced she knew what she was talking about. Witchlight revolves around the child of a magickal leader whose character reads as a cross between Crowley and Leary. The occultism is very accurate, and the story is nearly perfect. There are a few times you want to slap Truth for her stupidity, but feel you can't really blame her. She's falling under a spell, after all. I read this book straight through in one sitting. If you like the Darkover books, yo'll enjoy the expansion of Bradley's occult themes into our present reality."},{"Title":"Ghostlight","review":"I liked all of marion Zimmer Bradley's *.* -light novels a great deal.

Rather paltry after the mists of avalon, but, heck, anything looks paltry after it."},{"Title":"Ghostlight","review":"Yes, it was interesting. The subject matter is exceptionally unique. I've never read about anything like this before. The characters have groovy names - Truth, Light, Julian....etc. However, its not something I would read again and its not something I would reccommend. If you've read Zimmer Bradley's Mists of Avalon, you'll find this book extremely poor in comparison. However, once you get over expecting it to be as phenomenal as Mists..., its an enjoyable story. There are a few too many characters for my taste, and they aren't very developed. Don't buy it; get it from the library"},{"Title":"Ghostlight","review":"I would have liked this book a lot better if I hadn't read &quot;Mists of Avalon&quot; first.

A familiarity with the occult is recommended, but notabsolutely necessary."},{"Title":"Ghostlight","review":"... I rate this book such because the book lacked humor or appeal. The main character was so prudish and emotionally closed that it was a bore reading three hundred pages of her \\"rationalizing\\" and closed off views that became soooo predicatible. Speaking of predicatable the ending was about as predicatible as could get. Don't get me wrong... I love a good predicatible everything turns out the way you thought it would including a little side love-storybut NONE of the characters were developed to get attatched to... so it was an empty ending yet exciting ending (especially compared to the \\"haunted house\\" story angle it came from).If you think you want to buy this for any occult content then I would recommend you look elsewhere as there is little to relish upon.On the possitive side... I enjoyed the mystery, most of the side characters, and the background story.The book would have been a 4 or 5 stars if it was edited out 100 pgs and if the main character wasn't so prudish. It would have been an exceptional book in my opinion if then had 100 pgs more details and REAL character developement."},{"Title":"Ghostlight","review":"This book is awful and should be avoided at all costs. The plot is thin and has huge holes in it, I skimmed the last hundred pages just to get through it. Nothing annoys me more than when a female writer gives her female characters every negative female stereotype there is. Truth is supposed to be highly educated and working in the paranormal field but knows ABSOLUTELY NOTHING about it...she misses such obvious things that it is amazing she can tie her own shoelaces without help.If this is a real exampe of occultists in the modern day they deserve all the bad press they get as none of these people has any intelligence of their own and blindly follow whatever \\"cult\\" leader is convenient."},{"Title":"Ghostlight","review":"This book reminded me of when you are watching a movie and you constantly yell out"},{"Title":"Ghostlight","review":"It's one thing to have a book co-written by two authors. It's one thing, perhaps, to have a book ghost written for some famous person who has never written a book and is telling their story to a ghost writer -- though even those people are often honest enough to indicate the book is 'told to' in the authorship.But it is quite another to have an author who has written many books have someone else write a series authored under her name, copyrighted originally under her name and sold with the assumption that they are solely the author's work. I never could understand why I could never read anything but the first couple of pages of any of MZB's 'light' series before putting them down, convinced that age really had destroyed her writer's voice. Turns out I had a reason to think that as they were not written by her.I remember purchasing the 'light' series in hardback because I had loved the authors other works and wanted to give them a chance. And being so puzzled not just at how bad they were, for I had read all her early pulp works and knew she could be clumsy at plotting and rushed and sloppy in finalizing manuscripts, but shocked at how they had nothing of her voice or intrinsic themes. After you have read dozens of an author's books, you know the authors voice, style and themes. They were missing here.Now apparently, the truth is out that these books now have another person's name on the copyright, (though my original copies, bought when they were first published, have MZB) and this is the person who actually wrote them.I look at the dust jackets, which proclaim \\"written by the author of the Mists of Avalon\\" and have MZB's name on them and nothing of this other person, who did more than \\"prepare the manuscripts for publication\\" as MZB writes in one forward, and I really think both TOR who published them and MZB are guilty of both fraud and deception. All it would have taken to be honest would have been to put the other author's -- call her co author if you like -- name on the books. I wouldn't have bought them -- I hate collaborative works, they usually are terrible -- but most people probably would have. I wonder at the sheer fraud involved in this practice and how what was done can be legal. I feel like I deserve my money back.All I can say is if you are looking for books by MZB, don't buy this series. And you might not want to buy any of her books at all. By condoning this fraud, she certainly didn't show any respect or honesty toward her readers in her later years. And this is from a former fan of her work."},{"Title":"Ghostlight","review":"It's too late for me to read HEARTLIGHT first because I didn't find out that it existed until after I'd read GHOSTLIGHT, WITCHLIGHT, and GRAVELIGHT. I've never gotten around to reading my copy of MISTS OF AVALON, so I won't be making comparisons. My previous acquaintance with Ms. Bradley's writing was with her earlier Darkover novels. Yes, Truth is almost as annoying as The X-Files' Scully when it comes to denying the existence of magic. Yes, Truth often acts about as dim-witted as many gothic romance heroines were back when heroines were expected to be innocent and helpless. Yes, there were times when I wanted to reach into the book and shake her and scream out the obvious truths she was missing, but... This was still a gripping novel. I didn't suspect the whole truth about Thorne Blackburn's fate. I loved the house and its grounds. The occult trappings were very interesting. The characters came alive for me and I found myself impatiently waiting for each new twist to be revealed. One final note: My compliments to Carol Russo and Mark Hess. I LOVE a cover that accurately portrays the characters and surroundings in the book. Don't let its beautiful serenity fool you. This book is far from serene."},{"Title":"Ghostlight","review":"Something of a mystery here with the authorship. The cover only references Bradley, but the copyright is held by Rosemary Edghill (at least according to my copy of the book). I assumed that they collaborated on the book, but I wasn't sure why that hadn't been more broadly mentioned. Google turned up the following bit from an interview with Edghill:\\"Working with Marion was great fun. Because of her serious health issues at the time of the books, it was a different situation than working with Andre and Misty, and much more than in either of those cases, I was not only trying to re-create Marion's own style without intruding anything of my own, but to re-create her style from about 20 years ago, which involved immersing myself in her gothics, so I could not only pick up her style, rhythm, and word choices, but her ideas and her motifs. I was working from some unfinished manuscripts that she passed on to me for source material, and I used a lot of elements from them. Along the way I dug up some pretty obscure Bradleyana, like her \\"Sixth Sense\\" media tie-in, \\"In The Steps Of The Master\\", and a novel called \\"Can Ellen Be Saved?\\" which I think was based on a TV movie. Marion was a journeyman pro in the grand old tradition, who wrote anything that had a paycheck attached.Of course she oversaw everything I did, and when I finally got to meet her at the Fantasy Worlds Convention out in Berkeley, she told me how delighted she was with Heartlight, saying it was exactly the story she had always wanted to tell.\\"So apparently the book was not as much of a collaboration as much as a kind of premortem posthumous completion. Just in case you were like me, and curious about how it fit together. If I've got it wrong, and someone knows better, then let me know in the comments.Anyhow, mysteries aside, I was kind of dreading reading this based on how much I roundly dislikedThe Inheritor (\\"Light\\")which was loosely set in the same world. (I had bought it before I read the other book.) In that sense, I was pleasantly surprised. I'm not sure if it's the influence of Edghill or if it is just a better book, but I didn't hate it. It kept me reading and engaged and there were some really nice touches. There were even some nods to her Atlantis novels, if you were paying attention.It isn't a Darkover novel.

The protagonist's actions are frequently illogical and convenient. Much of the plot hinges on a book Truth inherits from her father, which her half-brother Julian needs to complete a dark ritual. So where does she hide it? Under her mattress, even though her room has been tossed a couple of times. When she finds a &quot;lost&quot; item in her half-sister's room, she decides it's a dandy hiding place for something else. Or she locks something in her car for safe keeping.

It is disappointing to see her so gullible in personal matters, so lacking in judgement, so devoid of simple logical reasoning powers, and so, well, flakey.If you're an avid MBZ fan, you are likely to either love this book or be thoroughly exasperated by it.

Thorn disappeared years ago after one of his famous occultist rituals went terribly wrong, and Truth's mother died. Truth, who does not remember the evening, went to live with her mother's twin, Caroline. Being raised in his shadow breeds a profound loathing of the man she barely remembers. Because of that, Truth devotes her life to proving that everything her father stood for is false - she becomes a parapsychologist whose duty it is to prove the paranormal false. Thirty years after his disappearance, her meek and complacent aunt reveals a secret on her deathbed - there were others...Caroline leaves some of Thorne's belongings to Truth to look through, and Truth takes them before Caroline can explain their history and returns home. Once there, Truth decides to finally write the book that everyone has asked for - the one of Thorne Blackblurn's life and history. She begins her research at her father's estate, Shadow's Gate, in upstate New York. Once there, she finds much more than she ever expected.Thorn had claimed to have magical powers, and when Truth arrived at Shadow's Gate she found a group living there, led by Justin Pilgrim, who hoped to continue Thorn's work. There was a library where Justin kept his collected works that contained everything of Thorn's or that mentioned Thorn or his work. Against her better judgment, Truth decided to begin her research using Justin's library. The more she researches and learns, the more she questions her own past and beliefs, especially when she finds that many of Justin's followers were followers of her fathers. Were they the others? Or did Caroline mean something else entirely?I seem to be hitting on a lot of the urban fantasy books out there and my taste seems to be hit or miss. This one has some romance and horror mixed in with it, but I usually like Marian Zimmer Bradley's work - that that I had read in the past, I had enjoyed. I cannot say that about Ghostlight. I really had a very difficult time getting into the story, and I had issues with Truth and her character. She was a very inconsistent protagonist who couldn't make decisions - which some say followed her growth and development - but that wasn't how I perceived the character. I was too aggravated with her changes in levels of education from one moment to the next and her emotional immaturity to connect with the character.

This shortcoming makes shopping for a specific herb difficult, as the more reputable plant suppliers rely on Latin names to organize their inventories. Although some plant catalogs group plants by colloquial names, if you are seeking a specific plant for a particular ailment, the search may prove confusing without the exact identifier, and the plant you finally select may be ineffective at best and dangerous at worst. (For example, the Bergamot that gives Earl Grey Tea its distinctive scent is probably the essential oil (Citrus bergamia) which comes from Asia, not the flower in my perennial bed (Beebalm or Monarda didyma sometimes known as Oswego Tea) native to the Eastern US, or Monarda citriodora the Lemon Bergamot native to the US West. Telesco does not discuss Bergamot, which might be just as well, but she also fails to mention Oregano (Origanum -- sometimes known as wintersweet or Majoram. She mentions the latter, but not all Oreganos are Oreganum majorana so she needs a crossreference as a minimum).As I mentioned, the author almost always provides one Latin name per entry, however, often several different species names are often involved. For example, \\"marigolds\\" are listed as Marigolds or Calendula in her book, not Tagetes, which is how many botanists classify them. If you want to add Marigold to soup or use it to rinse your hair, you probably want Calendula Officinalis. But if you want to deter nematodes in the garden, you want Tagetes. Similarly, Chamomile may be Chamomile or Matricaria - one an annual and the other a perennial (the annual is thought to taste better). Tarragon may be Artemisia or Tagetes, which takes us back to Marigolds.Other than horticultural confusion and lacunae, this book includes some interesting \\"spiritual\\" claims, but I have not read the ancients, so I do not know which herbs were preferred by which Gods and Goddesses or Spirits, with the exception of Asclepias who left little doubt, and Venus with her Dittany (Oreganum dictamnus) who is pictured at Pompeii bringing the wonder drug to the wounded Aeneas (I know this from other sources).Apparently Ms Telesco located various reputable and questionable sources that link various flora with ancient deities, so her claims are not unfounded. She provides a comprehensive bibliography, though I would have preferred to have seen footnotes linking her sources with her text. The book includes no photos or drawings to help the confused. You would do better to lay out the $$ and purchase the Van Wyck and Wink book on MEDICINAL PLANTS OF THE WORLD."},{"Title":"The Herbal Arts: A Handbook of Gardening, Recipes, Healing, Crafts, and Spirituality","review":"This is a good, concise herbal book containing history, folklore, recipes &amp; cooking tips, and more. There is also a decent appendix at the back, listing herbs and their corresponding planets, spirits/deities, magical correspondence (or use), and element.

Who outside of Europe ever knew that the greatest and most feared army of Europe in the Renaissance was that of a small Confederacy of city-states and forest cantons in Switzerland, the Helvetic Confederacy or the so called Old Swiss Confederacy (even while the most powerful Navy at the same time was that of the Republic of Venice).These people who invented modern warfare, also took democracy to another level and even ELECTED their military leaders on the very eve of crucial battles. Based on the contempt people have for Democracy today you would assume that this would be a recipe for disaster, but the Swiss met the best Armies of Europe, including that of the mighty Austrian Hapsburgs and Charles the Bold (along with his contingent of the allegedly undefeatable British Longbowmen), and annihilated them time and time again. With each sub-unit retaining it's independence and operating under multiple elected (and unelectable) leaders, one might expect the Swiss armies to be disorganized and parylized with indecision, but the Swiss showed how democratic organization can work when people want to work togehter; the Swiss Reislauffer were characterized by their fearless courage, tight battlefield discipline, and hair trigger boldness in battle.Tables in this Osprey book show ranks of pikemen and halberdiers made up of a bakers guild, a butchers guild, a cobblers guild and the like. The history of all of the battles, from the first victory by three tenuously unified Cantons over an invading Hapsburg army to the defeats of Charles the Bold two Centuries later. Reading this book will make you want to learn more about the Old Swiss Confederacy, and about the History of Europe in general.Emperor Maximillion of the Holy Roman Empire invented the Landsknechts in a conscious attempt to mimic the success of the Swiss. The Osprey book Landknecht Warrior contains yet more detailed information about the Swiss at War."},{"Title":"The Swiss at war, 1300-1500 (Men-at-arms series)","review":"I felt that Osprey's treatment of this subject was quite good. The plates, as usual for an Osprey title, are very good. The story of the rise of the Swiss armies is an interesting one and worthy of greater depth that Osprey obviously cannot provide.Coverage of weapons and tactics is good. Coverage of the history of the formation of the Swiss confederation that became modern Switzerland is brief, but covers the pertinent facts.One must have a certain amount of admiration for the men of little valleys and villages, as well as large towns, who band together to fight thoroughly professional, noble armies. Like most great revolutions from below, they are men who make their own laws, govern their own land, and fight their own wars - on foot, with long spears in formation with others like themselves, and on their own ground. At a time when armored, noble cavalry dominated, these men defeated them.This Osprey title is definitely worth the money. Kudos to Douglas Miller, Gerry Embleton, and Osprey for one of the few English-language titles illuminating the tough Swiss halbardier and pikeman."},{"Title":"The Swiss at war, 1300-1500 (Men-at-arms series)","review":"After the defeat of the Macedonians at Pydina by Rome's legions, one might have thought the days of the pike were over. True, some armies after Pydina used spear formations to stop cavalry such as the Scots at Bannockburn, but it ironically fell to the tough people of what is now Switzerland to really start a pike revolution in Europe. Originally famous for their Halberds and the ambush warfare that led to victory at Mortgarten, the Swiss realized their tactics needed improvement so they adopted the pike. Soon they would become feared by forces all over central and western Europe. The crowning achievment of the Swiss was likely their rout of the proud and powerful Burgundian army at Morat. Decades later, the Swiss were still respected and feared though on the fields of Italy, their time in the spotlight was running out. Overall an interesting and consice book on the rise of Swiss warfare."},{"Title":"The Swiss at war, 1300-1500 (Men-at-arms series)","review":"I think Switzerland is an example for everybody who wants to be free!"},{"Title":"Practical Atlas for Bacterial Identification (Sustainable Well Series)","review":"The book begins with a decent 6 page chapter on the &quot;Initial Stages to the Identification of a Bacterial Culture,&quot; then has a condensed version of Bergey's manual, which theoretically could allow identification to the species level, provided the information is correct and complete. I got this book yesterday, and found an error on the first thing I looked up. (in table 7.1 - Streptomyces does produce aerial hyphae.)A quarter of the book is &quot;The Atlas Concept,&quot; in which a map of bacterial genera is shown, organized so that &quot;the countries are families and the cities are genera.&quot; This atlas is then repeated thirty or forty times with shaded areas to show gram stain reaction, aerobicity, morphology, flagellation,catalase reaction, oxidase reaction, pigmentation, various biochemical reactions, etc. This may be somewhat useful, but in my opinion, not worth buying the book for.Approximately 20% of the book is useless unless you use the author's commercial BART (TM) identification system, which it appears is only used to identify iron-related, sulfate reducing, and slime forming bacteria. If using the BART system, this book may be worthwhile, although one would think that the package inserts for the BART system would contain the same information.Overall, I'd say get a introductory microbiology lab manual if you need to know how to read gram stains, determine aerobicity, and do biochemical testing, and use Bergey's Manual of Determinative Bacteriology for your identifications."},{"Title":"The day on fire","review":"I first read this while in college in the 50s.

Rimbaud wrote all of his poetry before the age of 19, and spent the rest of his life doing an amazing assortment of travels that anyone at the time would have been crazy to do.

Ullman has pulled off a major tour de force with this one. The story of the brilliant young poet Rimbaud (renamed Claude Morel)and his fiery relationship with the poet Verlaine(also renamed)unfolds with passion and fascination. Rimbaud's drug use is also frankly portrayed. Then the novel reimagines Rimbaud's lost years away from France in exotic Africa.

Rimbaud's life had every bit as much effect on me as Holden Caufield's and the free-wheeling lives of the characters of On the Road and The Dharma Bums. I think what affected me most was Rimbaud's incredible ability to adapt to extreme circumstances and his need for new experiences, much facilitated by his unusual ability to learn whatever language was placed in front of him.That I grew up to have some pretty incredible experiences of my own was due not in small part to the influence of this book.

The first time I read this book was 25-30 years ago and I wasn't Catholic. I thought the character of the villain (Monsignor Thompson) was grossly exagerated. Now I am older, wiser, and Catholic. The little excursions into possible plots bothered me at first as they did the other 2 reviewers, but it didn't take me long to see what Mr. Kienzle was doing. It is unfortunate that there truly are men like the aforementioned Thompson in the Catholic Church who probably do make victims want to gain vengeance, and there probably isn't anyone better than a former priest to write about them. I like the insights into canon law, Church history, Catholic humor, etc. that are part of this series. It saddens me that there is truth in the thought that priests, ordained ministers, elders, deacons, imans, and other religious leaders have been found to be just as human as the rest of us; however, I would rather read about it in good fiction like Kienzle's writings than read about in in the newspapers or see it on TV. Also I have met way more good men in the priesthood, like Fr. Koesler, than egotistical narcissists like Monsignor Thompson. I recommend the books to Catholics and non-Catholics alike to get a view of the Catholic Church in the U.S. in modern times."},{"Title":"Mind Over Murder","review":"Like most of Kienzle's books, this one has an interesting twist to it, but the plot becomes hard to follow due to the &quot;alternative plots&quot; contained within."},{"Title":"Mind Over Murder","review":"This book was certainly a unique one.

Now divorced, she's finding success running her own art gallery in a small town. Only Nick seems to be back in her life, and when he takes one look at three year-old Jonathan he sees that there can be no doubt that the child is his son, something he had not believed for one second years before. He wants his son. Knowing Abby's loyal heart, he threatens to financially ruin her friends and community, unless she remarry him. Abby knows that Nick needs an heir as his grandfather is ailing and instead of turning control of the family empire rightfully to Nick, he would turn it over to Nick's sister and her children. So she agrees to the marriage making it clear that when the old man dies, she will be free to take her son and move on. Nick spells it out clearly that their marriage, however long it is, will be a full and normal one.Ms. Baird grabs your attention and quickly your heart right from the beginning pages. This is a very powerful story of a deep love that should never have been broken. Nick's behaviour to Abby is quite ruthless, but we get very real glimpses of the immense pain he feels. Abby is a woman to admire, and through her reflections of their fairytale marriage and it's sudden demise, we can see how strong Abby has become. Both are incredibly passionate people who feel so deeply, yet allow their pride to keep those deep feelings from the other. Nick's regret and guilt for the years before, and Abby's fear that she will this time not be able to survive, make this a very intense and powerful story. Bravo to Ms. Baird! This one will be read over and over again!"},{"Title":"Shattered Trust","review":"I have read a lot of Harlequin Presents and other Harlequin books but I must say this was the first one that really made me mad and upset that a woman would take all the abusive treatment this woman did. The hero in this book, no I won't call him a hero because he was nothing like a hero, he was more a vicious, egotistic, maniacal, insult-sprewing, man that took every advantage of his ex-wife. He wouldn't acknowledge his son because he \\"thought\\" he couldn't have kids and then for some reason which I never caught in this book he decides he wants them back in his life and pulls every dirty trick to get them there. What bothers me most about these weak-willed women is they will suffer all the verbal abuse and emotional abuse their partner can dish out but the minute he looks at her or in this case holds her hand or brushes against her thigh, she melts and she falls into his arms. Where is the back-bone in some of these women? Some of these books have them but this one was really the worst that I have read to date, hence the 2 stars. Sorry, but that's the way I saw it."},{"Title":"Shattered Trust","review":"Perhaps it's because it's my third Jacqueline Baird book in a week, but this book was fairly disappointing.Abby and Nick were married and when they finally got to the stage of trying to have a baby, Nick stopped sleeping with her and openly started seeing other women. Eventually Abby left him but not before she got pregnant. Nick denies all claims to the child and divorces Abby charging her with abandonment.Four years later Nick is back in her life claiming that he was stupid to have lost her all those years ago and wanting his son and to be married to her again. According to his secretary/girlfriend who he'd been sleeping with before during and after their marriage, Nick needed a son in order to inherit his father's controlling shares in the company. He needed one before the old man died, a near event, and what better than a ready-made one?Abby winds up blackmailed into marrying him again but despite the fact that Nick couldn't remain faithful, was it possible for them to have a relationship?The answer is yes, because even though Nick is the dregs of the male species, she loves him and she wants it to work.I wanted to like Nick, I liked all the heroes in Jacqueline Baird's previous books, but I just couldn't like him. His reasons for the other women were so stupid. He found out he couldn't have children so stops sleeping with his wife and pretends that he's sleeping with other women so she'd hate him and leave him? All because he knew how much she wanted children? It's more believable that he stopped sleeping with her and went out sleeping with all the women he could just to prove he was still a man. He then has the nerve to call her out about sleeping with all sorts of men, and is pissed at her for not trusting him.There is really no insight as to why Abby would stay with him or why she would try to make it work, and there was nothing about Nick that really made you believe that what he says happened is what really happened.When she thinks that he might remain faithful to her because it was becoming too dangerous *see STDs* to be sleeping around all the time, it went from maybe it'll have some redemption to nothing will help this book.I gave it three stars because the beginning of the book had a lot of potential and Jacqueline Baird has a really good writing style."},{"Title":"Shattered Trust","review":"This was the first book I had read by Jacqueline Baird, and I have to say it was an absolute pleasure. I have to disagree with the other reviewer, I didn't find anything melodramatic about the couple's past.Nick is an Alpha male who gets what he wants.

Now he knows differently and blakmails her into marraige. How they resolve their differences is rest of the story.It is an interesting book with storng chemistry between lead characters. But the hero seemed callous in his attempt to distance the heroine. And the reason for the earlier divorce seemed too melodramatic. However it was an overall good read."},{"Title":"Shattered Trust","review":"Actually, I liked this book except for the treatment of the secretary. If not the heroine of a book, secretaries are always painted to be after the boss. No exception here.

I've read many German histories, but this was the one that left me feeling as if I understood the German soul. Especially valuable is Barraclough's illumination of Rome's, and a series of Popes', retrograde influence on Germany's early development. If you can only read one German history, this should be it."},{"Title":"The origins of modern Germany,","review":"I'm enjoying Barraclough's book, but the potential buyer should be clear what it is and isn't.Starting in the year A.D. 800, Barraclough traces the political development of Germany, and the book is indeed excellent for its handling of the early Holy Roman Empire, the Investiture Controversy, and the rise and fall of the Hohenstaufens.The accession of the Habsburgs inaugurates \\"the Age of the Princes,\\" which the author treats with a jaundiced eye. The unstated assumption is that Germany fell behind England and France by failing to come together as a unified state.Then one gets 100 pages on, brace yourself, 1519 to 1939. (The book was published just after WW2.) I haven't gotten there yet, but it seems safe to guess that the treatment will be on the cursory side, presumably with an emphasis on the continuing repercussions of the medieval background.So I would hesitate to call this *the* book to read on German history. Holborn's 3-vol. survey is probably better, but Barraclough's incisive analysis makes this a good one to have for the earlier period."},{"Title":"The origins of modern Germany,","review":"I purchased this book, in print, to help me understand the area that my paternal ancestors emigrated from in 1854.

Lawrence is better known for his various novels, i.e., Women in Love; Lady Chatterly's Lover; and Sons and Lovers than for his travel writing. With that said, I highly recommend this book. Personally I love Lawrence's writing style and this particular book is exceptional even for Lawrence. You will feel as though you are there with him experiencing the moment he is describing. The people and places of Italy come alive through his prose. His writing moves, at times, from reality and physical descriptions to abstraction and philosophy, but it is so wonderfully written, you will cherish every word and never question the move from one to the other. Images abound in this work and the scenes he describes are beautifully sensual. I have read this work twice and plan on reading it numerous other times throughout my life."},{"Title":"Twilight in Italy, (The travellers' library [19])","review":"I found myself reading, rereading, and rereading aloud, passages from this beautiful work.

I tried again and got to the town, whose name I forget, and walked along a road until I found the site of the Etruscan tombs and went down the stairs to see several of the tombs, which are now sealed behind clear plastic to preserve the painted walls inside. The paintings have faded since Lawrence described them but are still quite impressive, with flocks of birds and happy, plunging dolphins, people having what appears to be sado-masochistic sex or just smiling and eating.

This story was originally published in the Oxford American and was copied over and over by bluegrass fans and mailed all over the world. It was such an underground hit that it was published in book form along with some additional musings by the author. Piazza recounts a visit he and Martin made backstage at the Grand Ole Opry. It's the kind of thing you will never read in Bluegrass Unlimited. It is just too real! If you've ever seen Jimmy in person, you know what an outreageous character he is, and you'll love this book. Don't miss it."},{"Title":"True Adventures with the King of Bluegrass- Jimmy Martin","review":"I'm so tired of music biographies where the subject is either villainized or practically canonized; none of us are perfect saints, nor are we completely evil. That's why I always find it refreshing when a writer presents the true person, most of whom are a little of both. Piazza has done that here.Martin is something of a tragic figure; a mad genius. In candid interviews, Piazza has found all the good in the man, as well as peeled back some of the bad. He shows that if Martin had been born in another era, or been a king of another genre, he would have been a hero, but in the holier-than-thou bluegrass scene, the hard-living Martin was considered something of a black sheep, despite his obvious brilliance.This is a great book, and definitely one of the best music biographies ever written."},{"Title":"True Adventures with the King of Bluegrass- Jimmy Martin","review":"Tom Piazza has written a piece which captures with photographic detail several hours spent in the company of the Mad 3-chord Genius (as Marty Stuart writes in his forward) and Self-Proclaimed King of Bluegrass, Jimmy Martin. This &quot;book&quot; is essentially a fleshed out magazine article, but it's a good one. Less than 100 pages and written in a style that moves right along while giving you a &quot;you are there&quot; first person sense, it's an enlightening way to pass an hour or two.Mr. Piazza has a keen and insightful sense of Jimmy Martin's musical genius and place in Bluegrass History, and to me the most poignant moments in the book are when the writer is moving to shield or protect the intoxicated, loud-mouthed King of Bluegrass from injuring his already mussed reputation. As he observes, much of what makes Jimmy Martin &quot;great&quot; also dooms him to the edges of the limelight and that Grand Ol' Opry Membership that Jimmy Martin yearns for so badly will likely never happen, exactly for the reason of his unwillingness to back down or compromise.This isn't a &quot;biography&quot; so much as a thumbnail sketch of who Jimmy Martin is framed in a skillful depiction of a few volatile hours spent with a prime example of the &quot;Tortured Artist&quot;.I can't help but wonder if a well-written first-person account of a weekend spent with Van Gogh would have been eerily similar."},{"Title":"True Adventures with the King of Bluegrass- Jimmy Martin","review":"What a great little book!Jimmy Martin, arguably the greatest bluegrass singer who ever lived, is one of music's most colorful and fascinating studies. I've seen films about him, and even wrote a song about him (\\"Jimmy Martin\\", recorded by the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band recently), and listened to many recordings. This book gracefully captures the absurdity of the singer's life, a wry yet sympathetic document.Marty Stuart's introduction is fabulous and makes me want to read his book as well.This is one of the few books I've ever read where I'm audibly laughing. It is a hilarious, frightening, and sad ride. I just wish it was longer."},{"Title":"True Adventures with the King of Bluegrass- Jimmy Martin","review":"Double thumbs up to Tom Piazza.

The article that takes most of the room here is rambling and somewhat amateurishly-written (and poorly edited: \\"alright\\"? \\"Try and arrange...\\"?) The long sequence backstage at the Opry is interesting and cringe-inducing, but does little really to add any depth to the personality--just a longer look at a tiresome drunk, very sad.Jimmy Martin is a fascinating, larger-than-life figure, to be sure, and this does give a taste of that, but it's an article, not a book. There's a possibly useful overview of Martin's recordings at the back."},{"Title":"True Adventures with the King of Bluegrass- Jimmy Martin","review":"The book was informative but a bit disappointing in that it did not cover Mr. Martin's early life.

The information in the book talks about teams of people including transcribers, editors and final typists all working on a document that is edited and indexed to be used by historians, writers and other researchers.There is no info about conducting the interview. I suppose if I was involved in creating historical documents, I could have told that from the title, but I am not. I was dissapointed when I found out that the whole book is about converting spoken text to a hard-copy format and deciding what to include, whether to edit or correct the words spoken, etc.The book also needs some serious updating as it is still in the typewriter age with references to using XXX to mark incorrect text, using copy ribbon and carbon copies.If you work for an organization that is attempting to create historical records, this book might be useful but for the amateur, it is not going to help very much."},{"Title":"Transcribing and Editing Oral History (American Association for State and Local History)","review":"Fabulous 'how to' book.

Sorry to say there are a lot of mistakes (spelling, punctuation) on every page, too.As for the colloquial language: this style of speech is fitting for heroine Madison and her friends, but not for elders/grown ups as it does not put any distance between characters of a different age.The main character Madison could have been quite likeable, but she is too perfect and too powerful with hardly any flaws at all. This applies to her friends as well: they try so hard to be special and different, that they meet stereotypes from the other way round.The story developes so fast that there is almost enough story for at least two books, which is a plus on the side of the author's imagination but more of a minus on the side of the reader, as too many things happen in too little time.Despite all this criticism it can be seen that Elizabeth Ashe is a talented writer, who has a quite creative way with language and a really great sense of humor.The characters, the story - everything is there but went quite a bit over the top with 'In Shadowside'.I give the book three stars and add another as it is a first publication.All the best wishes for the writer.P.S.: My hopes for this book were high enough to have it imported to my country ;)"},{"Title":"In Shadowside","review":"This is a fabulous story.

I've actually been checking everyday this week just so I could order this book.I read \\"In Shadowside\\" when it was posted on Echo's website. It was so good, I sat for HOURS at my computer reading. Now I've ordered the book, so I can read it whenever and put it on my bookshelve with all my other beloved books.It's a MUST BUY for sci-fi readers into snarky redheaded witches!"},{"Title":"In Shadowside","review":"I remember reading this story forever ago on the internet, and eagerly purchased it when it was first published. I loved it then, and recommended it to a couple people. Then, after a couple years, I decided to pick it up again and dive back into the world. I don't know what happened between then and now, but I found the third rereading unbearable.Characters keep secrets... just because they find it interesting. Also known as a plot device. There's no reason to keep half the secrets from Madison (other than the whole her \\"needing to go about her own way\\" which made little sense) except to keep up tension and make a mystery. It proved incredibly frustrating instead of interesting. Also, at the risk of a slight spoiler, there was a huge action scene near the end- that we didn't get to see. We just saw the aftermath of what would have been an impressive and interesting scene.Furthermore, I counted maybe 10 (maybe more, I didn't really keep track) instances in the entire novel where Ashe used dialogue tags. It was incredibly off-putting, since there was such a large cast of characters. I've seen authors can pull this off all the time, but as all the characters had very similar ways of speaking (very inspired by -but not quite- Whedon-esque at that), I sometimes would have to go back and reread a scene to figure out who was speaking.Getting past this, there was a good plot somewhere in there, with interesting characters and the potential to be great. However, the novel was hurt by unexplained character motivation, pointless actions, and scant editting. I hope Ashe gets a better editor for the next one, as I do believe she has writing talent, it just was portrayed poorly in this book."},{"Title":"In Shadowside","review":"The imagination and attention to detail as far as the story and characters go was amazing in this book. I know I did not even catch all the popular culture nods in it. I think Ms. Ashe has the potential to be a very beloved writer due to her unique style. She has the imagination and wit to do so. All she needs is a better editor. There were plenty of typos in this book that could have (should have) been caught by the editor. Despite the typos, the story still held my attention. I think it's an excellent first effort by a new writer, and I hope to see more from her."},{"Title":"In Shadowside","review":"This book brings a quirky sense of humor to the otherwise been-there-read-that genre. The characters are endearing and quickly break out of their molds, while the underlying universe is solid. As the heroine grows into herself, she learns what she's capable of and I can't wait to see what she does next. I'm really looking forward to the next installment to this series to find out what she does next."},{"Title":"In Shadowside","review":"Although I enjoyed the book a bit, I must say I was sorely disappointed. I wounldn't say the book gave off incestous vibes as one reviewer so queerly pointed out. The only problem I had with the novel was Madison Leonine. As other reviewers stated...she is 'way' too over the top. Half the time I was hoping for someone to take A cheap shot at her and knock her one her rear. All the times she did wind up on it was her own doing. But alas, it is not my imagination and I have no right to devle into Elizabeth's at all.On the up side....I enjoyed the characters names :D."},{"Title":"In Shadowside","review":"I had the pleasure of reading the final edit of this before it went off to the printers... and I must say that it was fantastic. Anyone who is familiar with the author's work will know that her humor, sarcasm, and snark are some of the best out there. The book is filled to the brim with magic, vampires, and an assorted cast of supernatural characters that are unique and well-written."},{"Title":"In Shadowside","review":"I had the pleasure of reading \\"In Shadowside\\" when it was posted on Liz's website. It was amazing then - and it's amazing now. For those of us who have read her work over the years, seeing this book in print is a dream come true - though not nearly as much for us as for her.Liz's writing is always intense and detailed. Everything about her characters, from their names to their clothing, even to their tattoos, are chosen with deliberate intent and are rich with meaning. There are no throw-away characters and no throw-away lines - everything has been burned down to the very essence of her story. And the story is intense. Nothing is ever quite what it seems in the beginning.\\"In Shadowside\\" is the story of Madison Leonine who discovers, upon the death of her grandmother, that her life is not what she believed it to be. She enters the University of Transylvania at Shadowside and is introduced to her heritage as a born witch.On the surface, this would seem to be another in a line of books following in the heels of Harry Potter. Don't let that dissuade you - this is not a children's novel. \\"In Shadowside\\" transcends most genre designations; it has action, adventure, humor and romance, all wrapped in a supernatural package.Fans of Joss Whedon will appreciate Liz's writing, as her snarky voice and pop-culture references are similar to, and influenced by, Liz's own love for the Whedonverse.This is a writer not to be missed and one that I expect we will be seeing much more form in the future."},{"Title":"In Shadowside","review":"The complexities of the characters, whether purely dominate in nature or a simple subtext, draw the reader into a fantastic world that is similiar to our own. The romance is a kind of poetry in itself. No one falls for each other immediately, leaving the story more believable than most \\"typical\\" romance novels, as this isn't what this book is solely based on. This book, from beginning to end, is a journey that the reader takes with the heroine and is almost as surprised as she is when her own personal mystery is revealed to her. This book takes many of classical aspects of a mystery novel, laces it with the supernatural, throws in a bit of a \\"tugging of the heartstrings\\" and gives the reader a new and interesting look into a world similiar to our own. Witchcraft not included."},{"Title":"In Shadowside","review":"I adore Elizabeth Ashe's stories normally, and In Shadowside definitely has a good plot (if a bit too high-fantasy-like). However, if I hadn't been sick with a terrible cold while reading it for the first time, I wouldn't have had a choice but to take a red correcting pen to it. It feels like a rough draft of what could be a wonderful novel."},{"Title":"In Shadowside","review":"In Shadowside is a wonderful book. Anyone who has read anything by Elizabeth Ashe would agree. I will admit that there are some spelling errors, but that should not be looked at as a fault of the author, that is why author's have editors. I love the story, the vivid characters, and the plot. I can't wait for 4th Corner to come out. :)"},{"Title":"In Shadowside","review":"While I'm glad this was published I wish there hadn't been a rush because the same typos I remember from reading it online were still there in the supposed to be edited version. Despite that it was so worth ordering it (wish it was in stores) because it's a great story but almost to great because sometimes the characters are just too perfect and that can be annoying. It's nice that everyone has a role though, it seemed like everything was there for reason in the end. It's also long, almost two books in this one plus all the action/drama/ness that goes on can be overwhelming but still just gotta love this little world created in shadowside by the so talented author even if it get's too perfect."},{"Title":"In Shadowside","review":"This is just such a fun read.

I am so happy that Liz finally got this out, I've been a fan for years.This book will blow your mind, the twist and turns keep you turning the pages never knowing what's going to happen next. The action and romance are in perfect balance, off-set with Liz's sarcastic wit this makes for an incredible read."},{"Title":"In Shadowside","review":"I felt compelled to review this myself after buying the book based on the reviews posted here. Almost all of them were glowing, save one, which is the one I should have paid attention to. The fact that this writer was compared to Tolkien is a crock, thank you very much. In her(and any other fantasy writer's)dreams. Let the buyer beware.Although this was not a terrible book, it didn't stand out enough for me to consider it a \\"good\\" book, either. I found it to be derivative of Anne Rice, Harry Potter (without the whimsy) and any given Anita Blake novel. Elizabeth Ashe hasn't done anything new with her story: the main character, Madison Leonine, is an annoyingly archetypal heroine; beautiful, smart, sassy, perfetcly perfect, but with a dark secret. What a shocker."},{"Title":"In Shadowside","review":"While snarky and fast-paced, the book comes off as a race, rather than a pleasant stroll. I love Echo, and I am really glad that she was published, but I feel the nature of the story being posted one chapter at a time online added to the too-much-action-never-a-plot feeling.While I do enjoy the characters, there are too many. Too many names to remember, with each main character having at least 4. Smacks of Mary Sue, which I know Echo hates, so I'm slightly confused by the Mary Sue-esque actions of Madison. Too perfect, in my opinion.Also, When does she explain the concept of getting to the School? At least in Harry Potter we know that the young wizards get there by train and are still in this dimension. Ashe never really explains the world she's created.Now, as I have said before, I love Echo and her work, and while I feel that the story has many flaws, it also has its strong points. Interesting characters with unique abilities abound, but if Ashe just toned down her characters, cut a few of them, and quit with the Mary Sue-ing, I think this could actually get picked up and start selling to people who DON'T know Ashe from her internet days."},{"Title":"In Shadowside","review":"I fell in love with this novel after reading about it online. I was shocked to discover Books-A-Million didn't sell it, even though it was listed on their site, and was forced to wait while they ordered it. I understand it had/has some typos, but overall this is an amazing story. In my opinion Elizabeth Ashe combined the magic of Harry Potter and the sexual tension of Twilight (which didn't exist when this book was published) to create an amazing story. The only disappointment I have is that due to an illness in the family a sequel was postponed and it seems that a sequel will never be forthcoming. I personally contacted the author and received a message saying her mother had some type of illness and she had to care for her. Years have passed and I know the illness probably isn't a factor anymore. I suspect this brilliant author has gotten writer's block or has lost the inspiration she once possessed. I hope that I am wrong and that she will one day release another thrilling novel, but I am sad to say I doubt it. I am still addicted to this story and reread it often, but it only makes me hunger for more. I warn you if you can't handle a cliffhanger don't read this novel, otherwise you will have an amazing time stepping into this mystic realm known as Shadowside."},{"Title":"In Shadowside","review":"This book is an amazing read. I suggest it to anyone interested in the genre. My favorite part about this story is the characters and their relationships with one another.

I was not at all disappointed with the book. Elizabeth Ashe is truely an amazing unbelievable writer and her book just shows how much of a genius she is. I became totally caught up in the book and the characters. She make everything from the setting to the diverse character real and almost tangible to thr reader. I hope she continues to write so that I may continue to read."},{"Title":"In Shadowside","review":"I received this book as a gift and must say I truthfully enjoyed it.The style of the writer is refreshing and the words really flow into each other. The writer has a way of stepping into detail without it becoming boring or annoying which you don't see very often these days.The characters are nicely \`rounded' and securely put together, you can easily imaging them as real people and even link them to people you know! After reading the book you will even find yourself thinking; Hey that sounds like something Madison (or any other character) would say!Another plus of the story is that it's never as predictable as some top selling books like the \\"DaVinci Code\\". But here you never quite get what you expect!The Shadowside is a very believable alternate universe and is has the potential of Tolkien's Middle-Earth universe.In my book Miss Ash in a few years will be named in one breath with famous others like JRR Tolkien, Marion Zimmer Bradley, JK Rowling and many other great \`fantasy' writers.Elizabeth Ash I salute you and wish you the best of luck!And sincerely hope your future books and of course this little pearl will soon be translated to Dutch so I can force my friends to buy it."},{"Title":"In Shadowside","review":"I read Elizabeth Ashe's stories when she was still writing fanfiction and liked them very much for the entertainment value and her talent to write hilarious dialogues for characters e.g. from a TV series.Unfortunately it turns out that Ashe, as soon as she leaves these established characters behind, doesn't have what it takes to spin original characters that are engaging and believable.Sure there are still oneliners which made me chuckle but all in all these original characters are anything but and simply appear hilarious in their bigger than life, pompous and often predictable overdramatization.To read about a heroine who bit by bit turns out to be a super powerful witch, lost (grand)daughter of a unique couple, loveinterest of no less than 4 beaus and BestPossibleFriend is just plain boring.What makes heroes so engaging is our attempt in finding a bit of ourselves in them or emulating them. Madison Leonine and her friends are much too perfect to engage the reader in this fashion.Also, many elements seem to smack of Ashe's wishful thinking: Madison's uniqueness in her fashion style, the Gothic lifestyle in Shadowside, Tattoos which have a deep and spiritutal meaning, kisses that silence the world, inexplicable but irresistible attraction between characters (very handy, because it erases the need to explain why characters become close, the attraction being inexplicable and irresistible and all), exhibition of phenomenal, cosmic powers... I could go on.I am truly sorry, but IMHO Elizabeth Ashe has no talent for original fiction."},{"Title":"In Shadowside","review":"I have read this book several times over since I bought it, and every time I read it I like it more and more. The characters are unique and memorable, and E. Ashe manages to make us live the action as if we were there. In vivid detail.A terrific action / supernatural / romance / humor mix. Can't wait for the book number 2 !!!"},{"Title":"In Shadowside","review":"This book had a great ensemble cast! Every character was fleshed out and believable. I love the author's writing style, it's like she's sitting in your living room telling you the story. I will read anything she puts out!"},{"Title":"In Shadowside","review":"The first time I read this story was when it was published on the author's website nearly 10 years ago. At that time, I greatly enjoyed it. The author is/was a writer of Harry Potter fan fiction and since I enjoyed her works so much, I fell into her original world.Cue nearly a decade later where I get an instant message from an old Harry Potter friend telling me about the book. In all my excitement and nostalgia, I purchased with my Amazon gift card and received my book soon after.Elizabeth \\"Echo\\" Ashe has the tools but not a single idea what to do with them. The author who I at one time thought had such talent that exceeded my own proved that she is still nothing more but a writer in desperate need of a beta -- or a new hobby.Madison E. L. Leonine is nothing more than a Mary-Sue straight out of Harry Potter and a blatant self-insert on the author's part. Beautiful, perfect, \\"special\\", \\"one of a kind\\", it was a chore to read through her first days at the Hogwarts/The Covenant private university in another dimension. The beautiful love interest of a large majority of our main cast of men, not to mention the odd and rather unsettling interactions between Madison and her grandfather, Spider, which makes me wonder if the author had at one time a notion to pursue an incestuous sub-plot.There is no logical reason for the majority of \\"secrets\\" being kept from the main character except to only provide a reason to keep writing.The story was all too familiar of what I've read of Laurel K. Hamilton's Anita Blake and the worst of chick supernatural fiction on the market today. Ashe probably should have waited a few more years, worked the story a little more, because this premise would have been PERFECT for the Twilight-loving audience we have today (and I eagerly await for these days to be over). The too-perfect heroine whom everyone wants? Bella Swan, meet your new best friend.Since I really can't return this, I've taken to going through the book with my red pen and a small notepad. The second draft of this is coming along nicely.(two stars for actually going ahead to get this published)"},{"Title":"LAMB","review":"Folks, this is the real deal. This book pulls no punches.

Not only does it show the battle between good and evil as it manifests itself in all our endeavors here on this earth, but it also told me a lot about the author, Zeph Daniel. There are a multitude of characters and plot lines, enough to keep the reader entranced for a long, long time that flies by, however, like just a heartbeat. Mr.Daniel has a great command not only of the English language and literary style, but he speaks knowingly of things and areas that often are hidden from public view. His knowledge of the dark side and its minions are not just what he learned from a book or picked up from casual conversation. You can tell that he knows of these things from personal experience. An experience, that is both frightening yet reassuring at the same time, because he has overcome them.Mr. Daniel's novel, LAMB, was most intriguing to me as a fellow writer of such things as this because of what it told me about Zeph Daniel. I could feel in the spirit as I read this novel, the battles that Mr.Daniel himself has gone through in reconciling his sordid past with his new found freedom in Christ. I too led a life soiled by associations with Satan's minions. I too know what it meant to be set free from this and thinking that I was not deserving of such mercy and grace. The characters in LAMB express these feelings so eloquently. Their conversions are so miraculous. Their repentance is so sincere. Yet all I saw in my spirit was Zeph Daniel himself (and myself as well).LAMB is a great piece of stream of consciousness Christian fiction. It just flows from one battlefield to another, leaving the reader sometimes exhausted but always wanting more. I am sorry that it had to end. I would recommend it without reservation to anybody seeking the Truth. It is a sometimes difficult ride but you will not be let down. LAMB is a novel that needs to be experienced by all. It shows us the great redeeming power of a loving, merciful Savior.

It was very hard to put down once I started reading it. I can not recommend this book highly enough! It is as the author says only fiction writing, but much of what he has written has come to pass as he suspected it would. It is not for the fearful or faint of heart. The depths of satanic roots run deep into every aspect of society even the so called Christan church. A warning to those who are churchian types who hold their denominational doctrine as high as or above the word of God: You will most likely not like what you read here or pooh-pooh it as being new agey. This book is a soul mirror and you will see what is in your heart good or bad.

There is SOME Biblical truth. But when you mix that in with much error, and add in a false prophet's ego, you have a poisonous stew spiritually speaking.This book is supposed to expose satanism? It IS satanism! When you don't deal with the total Word of God, but you add in your own imaginings, that is satanism. You lead people to spiritual ruin. All satan did in the Garden of Eden was ask a subtile question, then suggest the entire Word of God wasn't true. What Lamb does is slyly work in things that are not Biblical. If you don't know your Bible, you will not be able to tell the difference. The author is very skillful and you will be drawn in by many of the characters. But please don't be drawn in by half-truths. This is where cults begin."},{"Title":"LAMB","review":"I just read &quot;Lamb,&quot; and I wish every single pastor and every single politician would read it and weep. The truth should not be shocking and outrageous. Daring. Explosive. A real knockout."},{"Title":"LAMB","review":"LAMB is a compelling book about the raw human spirit. It reflects how man can really screw things up if his way is not the Lord Jesus Christ's way!LAMB's characters come to life. It's 3-D without the pictures! There is a character with which every reader can relate. The inner dialog of the character's shows the silent workings and struggles of the human spirit. The struggle of good and evil.BEWARE, even though LAMB is fictional it exposes a lot of truth: How evil looks good and how those &quot;good looks&quot; deceive many.In the end, it leaves the reader glad to know that God's grace is perfect and in His love we have Hope.LAMB's a must read! Just can't put it down!"},{"Title":"LAMB","review":"I have read LAMB several times and the story is one that sticks with me, and continues to comfort and inspire. I love the authority with which the author exposes and condemns the evil and clearly upholds the meek and God fearing, whether they be rejected in society or functioning within a world which continues to startle them until they hear the call of the Lord.I think this book can be helpful to many lost on all spectrums, from the highest to the lowest, showing God's merciful love and His protection of His own and also informing many lost what they are connected with if they do not serve the Living God, and also that they too can turn to the Lord for forgiveness and salvation, and escape the wrath of judgement.The story has such delightful good guys and such despicable bad guys, that you absolutely love the victorious overcoming by the \\"lambs\\". The actual style of the writer is very refreshing in it's depth and poetry, treating all manner of spiritual insights with great dexterity. I hope that the author writes a followup, such as LAMB II or something, the further adventures of our remnant. A must read, this one will hopefully wake up alot of the fence sitters. I'm sure that Satan hates this book, and the fact that it is published...it shows how evil evil is, and it also shows how impotent the evil is against God's sovereign plan."},{"Title":"LAMB","review":"Lamb is a book about a cult. But with a twist. The cult is anyone who is a loser in the world system is a true Christian. This is the premise of this book. But this is NOT Christianity! A Christian may be a loser by the world's standards, but not every worldly loser is a Christian. Check it out in this book,find the pattern here. The character of Casey is totally new age. Angels born as humans, but don't know it until they reach a certain age then bring judgement on the world? Where in the Bible is this taught? There are so many things like this, I would run out of room here reviewing them. Not every church in the USA is run by satanists, but after you finish reading Lamb, you will think so! If you took Lamb seriously, you would be a heretic. Lamb is an interesting story, but so are many of the new age novels out there. Lamb should be listed as a new age story, and then I would write a review saying it was a very good new age story, except that as a Christian, I find little interest in that kind of book. I read Lamb because I thought it was Christian.True Biblical Christianity is a difficult, narrow way to follow. It is day to day, moment by moment giving yourself to Jesus Christ. Letting Him be Lord. Jesus doesn't need our eyes to look through as the book Lamb implies. He is able to see all just fine. If you want simple entertainment, Lamb will entertain you. If you want something to enhance your Christianity, Lamb will quite likely lead you astray, into the cult of thinking that if you can't hold a job, or can't cut it in politics, or as a Hollywood writer, that automatically makes you a Christian. What about following the narrow path that Jesus said was necessary? According to Lamb, all you have to do is not be able to function in life. Again, this is not Biblical"},{"Title":"LAMB","review":"I gave this book two stars just for some writing style and building some suspense. The author does an okay job with that. But if you know anything about the Bible, I would suggest you read something else that sticks closer to the Bible. If you want science fiction, Lamb is the book for you."},{"Title":"LAMB","review":"Today's society likes to flaunt its ability to dictate what is entertainment and what is factual. Zeph Daniels has managed to accomplish a stellar example of what should be advanced as intelligent entertainment. Get ready for a bumpy and memorable ride into the dark side and into the light. He has stripped away popular misconception about the darker side of what passes for religion these days. HURRAH!"},{"Title":"LAMB","review":"In a world of secret societies and hidden agendas Lamb comes as a breath of fresh air. Although a fictional story, it clearly depicts a hidden world of evil which exists among us. I found it very hard to stop reading once I had begun. Zeph Daniels takes us on a journey and shows us through the eyes of various characters their exposure to the evil that lurks among us today. It clearly illustrates the desire for power and how human life has no value to the elite of the world and how people will sell their souls for the love of power and wealth. He also comforts the reader by showing the truth about how Jah protects and guides his flock from the forces which seek to destroy them. A well written story I would recommend it to all who wish to see the truth though fictional eyes and gain a clearer understanding of the New World Order and their evil agenda for global enslavement of the world."},{"Title":"LAMB","review":"When I first started reading this book, I just couldn't put it down. One of the things which really impressed me about this book was Zeph's amazing writing style and prose: Everything flowed from scene to scene in a beautiful fashion. Why this book never made it to a top-10 list is beyond me?? Perhaps, it's too controversial, poignantly honest and hot for most people to handle, accept and deal with?? This book will show you how the Spirit of Jesus works through people via the Holy Ghost and Holy Spirit. If you ever wondered what spiritual warfare is all about, then this book is for you.. If you ever wondered and pondered about supernatural protection from/by the Lord, then this book is for you too..."},{"Title":"LAMB","review":"Warning: Zeph Daniel's \\"Lamb\\" is a novel that will capture you the very second you start reading.No, not just because it is a breathtaking tale that will take you around the world, and into bizarre situations. Even though it is a first-class thriller full of spectacular events and interesting personalities.And no, not just because a part of the story takes place in the Carrib and has Rastas involved. Even though it's a detail that can't be overlooked and causes a smile of spiritual recognition that will be confirmed throughout the book.In over 400 pages, the author takes us straight to the battlefield of the war between good and evil. We'll meet angels in disguise, working undercover by helping out the \\"lambs\\": those that are rejected by society but protected by His Majesty, JAH.\\"Lamb\\" starts with a lot of dead bodies. They turn out to be sacrifices to the forces of evil, slaughtered, like innocent lambs. The sacrifices are performed by powerful people in satanic rituals, intended to delay the second coming of the King of Kings: Jesus Christ, the Ultimate Lamb Who will return as the Lion and break the power of evil.These powerful people are the ones that run society, and on the outside they look like philanthropists and idealists working to make the world a better place. But when they're in their inner circle, their true nature is revealed.As the story progresses, the battle is getting hotter too. Supernatural events, natural disasters, psy-op's and the occult are revealed to be more than related. Hollywood, Churchianity, secret societies and agencies are all connected as well.Sound familiar?Indeed.The climax in the end, which won't be revealed here, contains a serious warning for each and everyone of us: prepare for the second coming of Jesus, for nothing will stop Him from returning!But no, this is not your average \\"Christian alternative\\" to Stephen King.In fact, we'll see how the \\"Christian Church\\" plays it's part of the side of evil, while persecuting those on the good side. And unlike Stephen King, Zeph Daniel is much more than a skillful story-teller because this is a story wrapped around the-way-things-really-are!Those who are truly born again in Jesus, are usually found in the gutter, in prison, in strange mental hospitals. Or working for a semi-superfamous band that runs on speed and cokane. Or living under terrible conditions in the Carrib.Sound familiar also?Indeed, it does.\\"Lamb\\" is fiction, but rather impossible to read without being touched in some way. When you love the truth, you will find some things to be rather revealing, especially when you might think Jesus Christ is all about $atan and $lavery.Zeph Daniel describes people and situations in such a way, that it becomes clear what the real Jesus Christ is all about: putting an end to evil and uplifting those that suffer under Babylon System!And that is the strongest aspect of this book.A book that should be read by those who (think they) are \\"Christian\\". A book that should also be read by those who (think they) know all about \\"Christianity\\"!"},{"Title":"LAMB","review":"Multi-characters keep the reader reeling in intense turn the page to see whats next in this true to life story.

Now I am no English lit major and I am not going to try to impress you with how educated I am. I liked it,plain and simple. This book isn't about style or english lit classes. This isn't the book to impress your friends with. This is a book about TRUTH.I would recommend this book to people who are sick and tired of listening to the religionists expound while they grow callouses on their buttocks from sitting on church pews. This book is for the people of the street. These are the people who are getting kicked in the teeth and told to like it. This is a book for people who aren't out to impress others with by search for status. This is a book that exposes the system and gives it a big, fat, black eye.I never met this Zeph Daniels but I think he must be one really cool dude.Thank you."},{"Title":"LAMB","review":"Okay, you could buy Lamb and plunk down 20 hard earned dollars, and what will you get for your money? A book loaded with questionable theology, silly plot lines, long stretches where you will get bored, and have trouble remembering who all the many characters are and how they tie in together. Lamb is loooooonngg, and tiring, and way too choppily written to be enjoyable or easily understood. I have a feeling the author is attempting to write a screenplay here, and it does not succeed. If this book ever gets made into a movie, I will not waste more money by going to see it!!!!So what is my better idea? Take your $20.00 and go see The Passion by Mel Gibson instead. Here is a movie that will explain the sacrifice for sin made by the Lord Jesus Christ in a way you will never forget. Mel Gibson has taken the hatred of the unchristian world for making this movie, and trying to stay true to the Biblical account. I have the feeling Lamb was written by someone who was unsuccessful in Mel's world and is now trying to find a way to be artistic. He has not succeeded. The taste I had after reading Lamb was sour grapes."},{"Title":"LAMB","review":"The author's website made Lamb sound wonderful, which is understandable, but in reality, I was disappointed. The author has talent, so it is sad to say the book is a terrible mish-mash of theology.Now, I agree with the author to a certain degree. By all means, it is true the down and outers of society are the ones who the Lord Jesus went to, and those were the main ones who accepted Him. But, that is NOT the qualification for the Christian walk. Nicodemus and Joseph of Arimathea are two who come to mind from scripture who were not down and outers who followed the Lord. My impression from reading Lamb is that the author is confused and seems to think that it is an exclusive club, that you must be poor and a dreg of society for the Lord Jesus Christ to accept you.The author needs to learn that it is giving up the world, which in in the control of satan, and following Christ, admitting we are sinners, repentence, and accepting His sacrifice for sin, that is the qualification for salvation. Do I think that there are many more of the poor and hurting and downtrodden who accept Christ? Absolutely. I'm one of them!But there are the materially blessed who belong to the Lord, as well. Just start with Abraham! It is your heart the Lord examines. The Bible says in Romans 4:3 \\"For what does the scripture say? Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness.\\"I noted on the author's website that he frets that he has trouble selling his books and CD, and believes it is because he is an outcast and persecuted because of his belief in Jesus. But I think it is not because of that at all. It is that his work is not touching the spirit of the true Christian, where the Holy Spirit dwells. He needs to study and understand the scripture, to seek the deep things of God, to desire humility and meekness so that he can feel the Lord's leading. Crudely ashing out at people will not bring them to Christ. This young man should study how the Lord Jesus Himself talked to average people. Then he may be able to write a book that touches the heart and soul of those who walk the narrow path with Jesus Christ. It is a difficult path of self-sacrifice and \\"be ye holy, as I (God) am holy\\". Poverty, alcoholism, drug abuse, etc., are weapons satan uses to destroy and are not the things that equip one to walk the arduous way. It is the Lord Jesus who seeks to deliver us from such things.If the author learns these things, one day there may be a much better book come from him, if he lets the Holy Spirit lead. In closing, it came to mind that it is not just the televangelists who can find publishers and sell books. I find most of those to be cotton candy, and some of them even poisonous. They are not the spiritual meat Christians need either. The Lord brought to mind many of the greats, such as J Oswald Sanders, R A Torrey, Andrew Murray, Oswald Chambers, Merrill Unger, D L Moody.......the list goes on and on. All of these wrote wonderful, deep meaningful Christian books and were able to find publishers. Why? Because they had something to say, something to edify the body of Christ, the true saints of the living God, wether rich or poor, walking closely with the Lord or just starting out and struggling. These books have stood the test of time!I think if Mr. Daniel reads books like these, and studies the scripture with Holy Spirit guidance, with his talent he could write a book that has something to say to the Christians who are tired of Purpose Driven, Laodecean fluff!"},{"Title":"LAMB","review":"Is anyone else tired of books that supposedly reveal something but are just long, boring diatribes from some would-be authors imagination that in the end say........nothing?My English Lit class would have a field day with this book, shredding it from cover to cover. Where is the technique, the writing style, a bit of art form? Show me a single lit device used in this whole book? I read this book as a favor to a friend. We are still friends after I gave him my opinion of the book and now he is taking a second look. From what he had said, I expected some wit and style and form. I think he was so hung up on the subject matter, that he didn't see the structure flaws until I pointed them out.As to the subject matter, I have studied it before I read this book. First in church, then on my own. I believe in The Lord Jesus Christ, believe in Him as my savior, know there is no other way for the forgiveness of sins except by the washing of His precious blood shed on Calvary's cruel cross. He is my redeemer, my Lord, my friend, my everything. I expect Him back soon, but have no use, and definitely no need, for the self-proclaimed prophets among us who think they are going to show all us dumb folk who carry a simple faith in Christ Jesus what it is really all about. They always go afield, always add to as well as subtract from the simple truths of the Bible. If you know the truth about what the Bible says about the endtimes, you will know what I am talking about.I think this book is supposed to read like a screenplay. Please don't let it be coming to a screen near me anytime soon!!!!!!!There are enough lousy movies out there as it is. This author is no Mel Gibson."},{"Title":"LAMB","review":"This is a scary book. It's all spiritual warfare. It really shows how man brings about his own destruction through obediance to evil. Nuclear war and earth shifts. How God uses his lambs and angels to destroy wickedness. Very trippy and prophetic. Kept me going till the end, especially with what's going on."},{"Title":"LAMB","review":"Anything but meek and mild, Lamb is gritty and real the way too few Christian novelsare, and it makes them look like the puffery they are.

All you can dois hang on...and pray."},{"Title":"LAMB","review":"This book is as cutting edge as it gets.It shows how so many in the church today are just playing church.An exposes the enemy in the church today,an the satanic forces whose ultimate goal is to kill every christian on earth during the rein of the Anti-Christ.So that Jesus will not have a bride to return to.This is a wake up call.A sounding of the alarm to all who have an ear to hear.The church an all it's denominations today are more concerned about being politically correct than walking the walk.All they care about is their rituals,traditions,an relgion.Not about a relationship with JESUS.They only care about a performance.Not the presence of the Holy Ghost.They only care about their place on the board,or the band.An not the lost an the needy.This is a book for the remnant.An to wake up an ... off those who have strayed away from course,an followed themselves instead of their savior.Those who profess to be men an women of God,but are actually worshiping themselves an their ego.This book tells me to come to the end of myself,an let it all be about Jesus.To let my ego die,so Jesus can live in me.An then I can serve him an save souls for the eternal kingdom.This should be mandatory reading for every church except the thin skinned who will of course take offense.They can be bitter, or better.It's their choice.The truth really does hurt.And it will also set you free...."},{"Title":"LAMB","review":"If you believe the bible, the world does not like, and cannot accept, The Truth, plain and simple. Jesus is not of the world, just as His followers are not. Truth is persecuted. That's why for example, the world has really taken in \\"The Passion of the Christ\\". Number one in the box office, so much $$$$$$. It came from the world through Hollywood. It has some lies mixed in (\\"The Dolorous Passion of the Christ\\"- the movie's main motivation- totally unbiblical- check out Rev. 22:18) yet it is proclaimed as gospel truth. It is not from God. Know ye not that a little leaven leavens the whole lump? If you are a true seeker of Jesus Christ, you know that He is alive. You know that He will be returning in a time of great deceit. This book, Lamb, portrays this exactly, and is filled with the truth of God's love of the \\"little man\\"- the meek, the mournful, - the last shall be first. Not worthy, never perfect, but forgiven. The ones who will suffer persecution, the same as their Lord. The ones who will not be deceived. The ones who come out of the Lie. Let go of the world. Fully trust the Saviour. The ones who truly know that they are forgiven, and as the parable of the creditor tells us, those who have had more forgiven will love Him more. It is a story, a parable if you will. Not proclaimed as truth, as other big, worldy man-made productions dare to claim. No one has it right, not one is righteous. But some have more love than others. And some stand out and DIVIDE, as Jesus said His truth will do. This story is an outpouring of love from one who seeks to reach the lost, for the very reason that Jesus reaches out to us- to bring us out of this evil world through His forgiveness and into the kingdom of God. That is where we really are when we give ourselves to Him. Reading Lamb was quite encouraging, and is a humble labor of love. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"LAMB","review":"Great read. This would make an awesome movie. The characters are real people, not pablum. God raises up the meek, the unlikely, and the poor to do His Will--angels exact God's judgment against a hateful, evil world. The characters are simply unforgettable. Each very different, as the author weaves a story of hope in God and not in man. Real angels, not fairies. The only book I've read that exposes satanism for what it really is and puts all hope in God's victory. The lambs are like David to Goliath, the little guys win! You really root for them. Excellent."},{"Title":"LAMB","review":"Intriguing. That's the first word that came to mind, as I was reading several pages into the story. As I continued into chapters four and five intriguing, changed to, wow.As a writer I tend to look at the sentence structure and continuity of a story as I'm reading. I try to overlook things, but I can't. It's just in me to critique as I'm reading. I've often penned in changes in spelling and punctuation in various books I've read. Not that I'm perfect in my writing abilities, just ask my editors! But having read many books and written some of my own I've learned to look at things differently. So I would like to share now about the book \\"Lamb, by Zeph E. Daniel.\\"There are many characters and plot lines going on at the same time in the book. At the beginning it is somewhat hard to follow. Once you are introduced to everyone though, the flow of the story takes over and you are plunged into the rapids on an exciting ride.You are first introduced to Officer Bauman. He is an overworked, unappreciated policeman with the LAPD. His story takes you to the street people of LA. He knows there is more to the homeless vagabonds than society gives them credit for.Next, there is Ted Gunderson. He is a pastor of a small church near LA. He knows there has to be more to a relationship with the Lord than what is commonly taught in the churches. The problem is, the majority of his church members don't agree with his \\"new\\" philosophy on life.Cal Wilson is a pilot for hire from the coast of Florida. He's led a hard life and often flew the wrong type of cargo for what he thought were the right reasons. For him, the government gives his reality an interesting twist. Or does it?Stephen J. Petchick is a mechanic and former prison inmate. He seems to be just your common run of the mill guy. Just the kind of man the Lord could use in a mighty way, if he is willing.Another character is Arles Dubailles. He's a successful man. Wants to provide for himself and his family. He's moving up the ladder of influence with all the right people. But, who is he really? Is he willing to sacrifice his family to continue up the ladder?These are just a handful of the many characters within \\"Lamb.\\" A plethora of personalities combined into many individual adventures within the realities of their lives. What are their stories? What really goes on behind the scenes of the elite in this world? What is the truth? Will it be revealed?Zeph has an interesting style of writing. I can see the words he writes come from a very creative mind. Sometimes the paragraphs had run on sentences. But within the style of the story this seemed to fit. Like, there was much to be told but so little time.The overall writing style has a sense of urgency and wild abandonment. At first the reader sort of, stumbles along, trying to figure out the many characters and plot lines in the story. Even within that stumbling, you are drawn in, wanting to find out more. You are silently encouraged to want to learn more about each character. What story do they have to tell? How will events pan out for each of them? Who will survive? Who will die, if any?I found this book to be insightful, creative and intriguing. A definite breath of fresh air among the thousands of books published each year. I highly recommend this story to anyone who loves adventure, and mystery. Even though this story is fiction, the truth of our heavenly Father, Yahweh is shared throughout its pages."},{"Title":"LAMB","review":"I have read LAMB several times and the story is one that sticks with me, and continues to comfort and inspire. I love the authority with which the author exposes and condemns the evil and clearly upholds the meek and God fearing, whether they be rejected in society or functioning within a world which continues to startle them until they hear the call of the Lord.I think this book can be helpful to many lost on all spectrums, from the highest to the lowest, showing God's merciful love and His protection of His own and also informing many lost what they are connected with if they do not serve the Living God, and also that they too can turn to the Lord for forgiveness and salvation, and escape the wrath of judgement.The story has such delightful good guys and such despicable bad guys, that you absolutely love the victorious overcoming by the \\"lambs\\".

This book really made me want to study Gods word more diligently."},{"Title":"LAMB","review":"Lamb is the kind of book for people who say they don't want to put God in a box. Great, but then they go and make Him into something they like. Sure there are people in churches who are hypocrites. But to write off churches in general is totally ridiculous. Check out the website for the author of this book, check out the archives for his messages. The author seems more concerned about the war in Iraq, seems to determine a person's Christianity on their view of the war. Supporting President Bush on the war appears to make one a satanist, which makes me leary of the theology presented in his book. As for literary style, I found it interesting, but a bit confusing in parts, and somewhat boring in others."},{"Title":"LAMB","review":"This is a ficitonal book with very plausible scenarios and characters showing how we do not battle against flesh but against principalities. (Eph. 6)It's so easy to live in this world and be a part of it; but christians are told not to be a part of it. This book shows us why. This book makes very real the ways that the &quot;spirit&quot; of the world can be operating in our everyday lives - especially in our churches. (1 John 4:3 And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God: and this is that spirit of antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world.)The book in grounded in the truths of Scripture without being another dead Sunday morning sermon. I wish the sermons I hear would have me sitting on the edge of my seat as this book did. I wish the sermons I hear would be such a call to action as this book is. It's a wake up call - I've got to go put on the &quot;whole armour of God&quot;, now.Michelle"},{"Title":"Secrets of the Amazing Kreskin","review":"I bought this book on a recomendation. The vast majority is entertaining,informative, & Honest. My only complaint is that after he has explained the mechanics of how he does his illusion, he sometimes tries to sell us on the idea that he occasionally can do feats that he can't explain. This is simply not true. He DOES know how these feats are done, as does every mentalist on the planet. My guess is that he has a following of \\" Believers \\" and so feels obligated to include just a little mysticism in the text. His section on hypnosis, and what actually occurs is lucid & revealing. One explanation on how to do an effect made me laugh out loud. Not because it was silly, but the explanation was so simple, I was caught off guard. Certainly worth the price of admission."},{"Title":"Secrets of the Amazing Kreskin","review":"Really a well written book. Very insightful about the world of one the most well known mentalists.

Written in a very readable fashion."},{"Title":"Secrets of the Amazing Kreskin","review":"This is a great little book and makes very interesting reading. The illusions alone are worth the price of the book. In fact, I tried several of them and they are easy to perform with little to no preparation.I found the writing to be excellent and the overall flow was great. I do believe he did a little too much \`name dropping' but then again, if I had traveled in his shoes, I might drop a name or two myself. What's the harm?I did find the parts of the book that talked about getting more in tune with your own senses to be of interest and thought provoking.My only caveat which prevents this from being a five star book is Kreskin's adamant assertion that ESP is fraudulent and then going on to give examples of his own ESP (all the while insisting he doesn't know how it works). I suppose he was leaving some room for those true believers that attend his shows to believe he really has harnessed powers that elude the rest of us. The way it was presented just rang a bit of disingenuous to me.Overall, a good book and recommend for mentalist fans.I hope you find this review helpful.Michael L.

This edited collection shows that the approach he has been working on for the past several years, has finally come of age.The first synthesis of law and economics took place several decades ago, based on the seminal work of Nobel prize winning Chicago economist Ronald Coase. The synthesis was based on the so-called &quot;rational actor model&quot; (often called homo Economicus) that can be derived from certain axiomatic, mathematics-like principles, based on the notion of self-interest and utility maximization. This was a major breakthrough in social theory and policy.But the &quot;rational actor model&quot; has been shown to be systematically violated by real human beings, and behavioral economics arose to ammend the &quot;rational actor model&quot; to fit the reality. It's not that people are irrational, but rather the concept of rationality used in the traditional theory is seriously wanting. If you're interested in this larger backdrop to the present book, there is a marvelous new book on the subject edited by its creators, Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, called &quot;Choices, Values, and Frames.&quot;The introductory chapters of Behavioral Law and Economics are refreshingly clear and free of jargon. These are followed by some of the most important articles that have been written on the topic over the past several years.Behavioral law and economics is not just some academic field. It is absolutely, front and center, critical to political philosophy and the policy sciences in general. This book is for both expert and layperson alike---a real tour de force."},{"Title":"Interrupted Marriage (Silhouette Romance)","review":"Laurey Bright does another excellent job of presenting a realistic portrayal of a marriage and its problems.Jade and Magnus Riordan had begun their married life with financial and family problems--Magnus' father had died and left a demanding and invalid wife, three younger and difficult teen-agers, and large but struggling sheep and cattle farms in New Zealand to be maintained.These and other stresses became too much for Jade, resulting in a nervous breakdown for her and a resulting 2-year stay in a mental-care facility. She was also left with a spotty memory, unable to recall much of the last three years.The real story for Jade and Magnus begins as Jade emerges from the institution, ready to resume her life with her husband but finding many difficulties to overcome.Laurey Bright does an excellent job of characterization, creating realistic, likable, and empathetic characters in an interesting setting and intrigueing plot. Her writing style is easy to read and readily draws you into her story. She has drawn a realistic portrayal of a woman trying to resume her life and marriage after a traumatic interruption."},{"Title":"DARKER","review":"Everything I've ever read about Santa Fe has clearly been through the eyes of people who didn't grow up there. This book paints a real picture of what living in a tourist town can cause for those who have to survive amongst the hype and out of control cost of living in such a place, as I've always read about. Jaramillo paints a picture of reality one can find in many cities throughout the country, but not expected in a city like Santa Fe.

I've got loads of fish cookbooks, but this one sounded particularly good for a beginner. Well, she's never gotten the book because I'm using it. The detail on types of fish, for instance, and cooking methods, provides a good balance between too much and not enough information. The clear, easy-to-follow recipes are sophisticated, yet simple.

In Voices, we meet people who live in fear, in awe, in tradition and history that we here in the US have almost no connection to, and we are privileged to take a glimpse into their lives and passions.

All the poets included live and work in Israel but write in English. They come from all parts of the country and from many walks of life and backgrounds. This gives the anthology a quite extraordinary variety and depthpoems range from the reflective to the sardonic, from humor to tragedy, from the intensely personal to the generally philosophic. Although the poems were mostly chosen for their focus on the experience of living in Israel, the concrete imagery, the intellectual richness and sheer intelligence found on every page, give the book a much more general significance, andmake this New-York produced volume a must for every lover of poetry.Margo Tepper"},{"Title":"Lady of Ch'iao Kuo: Warrior of the South, Southern China A.D. 531 (The Royal Diaries)","review":"This was a very enjoyable book to read, and one of the best of the Royal Diary Series books.

She knows that if the Hsien and the Chinese could only become allies, they could fight together against their common enemy. But is an alliance between two very different peoples even possible?

Usually by that point in the books, something interesting has happened. Not so in \\"Lady\\". If you feel you have to read it, try to get it from a library or a friend first to decide whether or not it's worth it to buy it.

Perhaps if the length of the book had been shorter, it wouldn't have seemed dull. Yep seemed more interested in war strategies then the life of Princess Red Bird. I was disappointed he did not give more detail of her schooling and life at her palace. Another major disappointment was finding out nearly all the characters in this novel were fictional. This statement should have been brought up in the beginning before one begins to read, rather than after the book is finished. The final disappointed was in the epilogue - it was very un-detailed. I do not recommend."},{"Title":"Lady of Ch'iao Kuo: Warrior of the South, Southern China A.D. 531 (The Royal Diaries)","review":"When I first got this book I expected bamboo, chopsticks, honorable monks and all that other stereotype Chinese stuff. But I saw that life in sixth century China was not that way. The Chinese were beyond bamboo but the Hsien people to the south weren't.

The Hsien send their Princess Red Bird to become a liasion and makes a clever plan to defeat the Dog Head Elephants. This Clever Book-loving Princess records in Five Scrolls her life living with her Father the king and then later her brother King Little Tiger who was a royal pain like this other Chinese rich colonist girl who ends up living with Red Bird.

As she is the only one in her family who can speak and understand chinese, she is imperative for diaplomatic missions as an interpreter. As the Dog Heads, an enemy people of the Hsien and Chinese, start attacking, Princess Red Bird must help her people survive. She wants to join two cultures in an alliance, the Hsien and the Chinese. With her effort and wise, natural leadership skills she will shape her people.I might be biased when I say I love this book as I am from Southern Asian descent. However, Laurence Yep gives his smooth historical fiction effort as usual and if you have a penchant for his books, it's a definite read. For everyone and the Royal Diaries fan, this shouldn't be a miss. It is far more longer than most of the other Diaries and has more plot incidents than many of the others.

Princess Redbird has to collect the broken pieces, defeat the Dog Heads, and uncover the traitor. During all this she finds time to read. She reads about Master Meng and how he describes peace, though it doesn't seem real to her. In her reading she was able to come up with an idea to defeat the Dog Heads. All she needed was careful planning and a little bit of magic. You must read this book to see how the brave princess defeated the Dog Heads and bring peace to her people and the Chinese. I never knew there had been a South China monarchy. I also didn't know there had been feuding tribs in South China.

It could also be about how she helped win the war with the Dogheads. The theme could be about the Dogheads because they are scattered through the entire book. But, the moral lesson could be how she helped the Hsien win the war.The main character's Hsien name is Lady of Ch'iao Kuo. She also had a Chinese name, Princess Redbird. Even though this is a fictional book, the Lady of Ch'iao Kuo was a real person. She lived during the sixth century AD.Some supporting characters are her Mother and Father, and her siblings, Little Tiger, Hibiscus, Drongo, Begonia, and Barbet. Of the Hsien people, there are the royal steward, Peacock, a potter, Auntie Goral, Little Tiger's best friend, Coconut, her nursemaid, Kumquat, her guard, Uncle Muntjac, the royal chef, Toad, her maid, Francolin, Little Tiger's advisor, Great-Uncle Sambar, and Lord Leopard who ruled Big Rock.

It is set in China in the Hsien tribe. Also it is partially set in the Chinese colony near the Great Forest. They are in the middle of a war with the Dogheads.The major problem in this story is the war with the Dogheads. The Hsien and the rest of the tribes as well as the Chinese were having trouble with the Dogheads invading. When the Dogheads would invade, they would set fires and brutally beligerantly behead innocent bystanders. The Dogheads were malicious.All of the tribes as well as the Chinese banded together.

I felt that this book by Laurence Yep was one of the best written even though long at times. He writes about the real person Lady of Ch'iao Kuo, Warrior of the South, in Southern China in A.D. 531. I don't know much about Chinese history but this book was filled with details about her life centuries ago.The Royal Diaries series is an excellent gift for girls and even boys. Laurence Yep writes in detail and specific about understanding the time period. There were wars and violence that threatened the Lady of Ch'iao Kuo's life which was not all sweet, innocent, or free even though she was privileged. She was targeted as well for her position in Chinese royalty.Still the historical fictional diary offers some insight into her life during this time period as a middle school girl just like any other girl. I think that's what is the purpose of these diaries is to connect students today to historical time periods. I think students and even adults will find it fascinating.I don't think you can read it just once. There is too much going on. The back of the book is filled with the actual information about Lady of Ch'iao Kuo's life and achievements as well as explanations of Southern China's history.Laurence Yep has become an expert on his Chinese heritage by studying it for over 20 years."},{"Title":"Lady of Ch'iao Kuo: Warrior of the South, Southern China A.D. 531 (The Royal Diaries)","review":"I had read some of Laurence Yep's other books before finding this gem, and I have been nothing but impressed with this author. He has a passion for his culture and a gift for writing - what better combination could you ask for?I purchased this book almost immediately after it came out because, frankly, I had all the other Royal Diaries up to this point and wanted to add the latest to my collection! I think it is the longest one in the series, and, in my experience, the most difficult. I read it when I was 13 and struggled a little through it even though I was beyond my years at that age. That being said, I think the label \\"9-12\\" should be ignored.The story contains rough material - lots of war, lots of death, lots of emotion. Laurence Yep does a fabulous job at communicating sentiments the average reader would not personally know. The character herself shows great character development, which makes her a strong candidate to be inspiring. Although the book is ficitional, it contains plenty of historical fact and should encourage the reader to research for him/herself, too.While many of the Dear America books are very much aimed at teenage girls, I think the fact that Laurence Yep wrote this may have helped it be a little more neutral. In fact, my dad read it and enjoyed it as well.I would recommend this book to older teens and adults, although I would not rule out the possibility of younger children (i.e. 11-12-year-olds) being able to read it. Yet I think part of the beauty of this book comes with experience that only years and life can give, so I plan on reading it again soon to see what I missed out on last time I read it when I was 15."},{"Title":"Lady of Ch'iao Kuo: Warrior of the South, Southern China A.D. 531 (The Royal Diaries)","review":"Lady of Ch'aio Warrior of the South, by Laurence Yep, is an amazing story that will take you through the diary of a Hisen princess.

Set in sixth century China, this book is everything you don't expect it to be.Princess Redbird is the oldest daughter of the ruler of one of the many tribes in the Great Forest, on the boundaries of the Chinese empire. Though she is Hsien, and therefore considered barbaric by the neighboring Chinese, her parents have selected her to attend a special Chinese school in the nearby border settlement, in order that she might learn the Chinese language and customs, and act as an interpreter for her people in their dealings with the Chinese.Redbird may be a young princess, but she is no delicate swooning maiden. She is considered by her people to be clever and wise (although she fears she is neither), and she is called upon regularly to settle minor disagreements between neighbors. She hunts for game in the Great Forest, and can walk a steady pace with the soldiers who escort her along the difficult journey to her school. She is compassionate, protecting the old soldier who leads her escort from the shame of his growing weakness, and seeking to form some kind of peace between the Chinese and the tribes of the Great Forest. Most of all, she hungers for learning, and loves the books which have been given to her by her kind teacher.When her tribe is forced to go to war, Redbird is recalled from school to find her world turned upside down. Her older brother, unwise and unready to rule, must be prevailed upon by his advisors and their people to listen to Redbird and her wise advice as they are set on all sides by enemies. And even as Redbird prevails upon her rash brother to listen to her, she worries that her advice may be neither wise nor effective, and she struggles to find some kind of balance between her desire for revenge and her yearning for peace.This book is a quick and fascinating read and is nothing like what I expected from a novel telling the tale of a Chinese princess. I expected something sedate and quiet, with minor 'battles' between women over points of ceremony and decorum. Instead, 'Lady of Ch'iao Kuo' is an action-packed adventure with war, intrigue, and danger. Though Redbird is young, she is brave and loyal, willing to take up her hunting bow in defense of her Chinese friends. She is wise enough to know when to disobey her royal family, and her people are strong enough to know when to back their clever princess in her plans. And though she takes justified delight when her advice leads to triumphs for her people, she still mourns over the futility of war and yearns to bring her people a peace bought with kindness instead of cruelty.I heartily recommend 'Lady of Ch'iao Kuo' to both children and adults. The story is compelling and entertaining, and this fictional portrayal of Redbird results in a realistic young woman worthy of admiration and respect.~ Ana Mardoll"},{"Title":"Lady of Ch'iao Kuo: Warrior of the South, Southern China A.D. 531 (The Royal Diaries)","review":"I really enjoyed this book.

The story is fantastic."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"The book came in perfected condition as it said on the review of this book. It came just in time."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"About two thirds through this undeniably great work, I began to question everything I thought I knew about this book. Kicking off in high drama and then barrelling on in that fashion with not even a stop for air, the twists and turns in Hardy's tale of morality, regret, and character seemed to occur due to the faults and failures of the principal actors, and not thanks to any plot contrivances on the part of Hardy. Which ever the case, this is a great testament to Hardy's writing abilities, but as the story progressed, the idea that Hardy was pushing the limits of \\"fate\\" and \\"tragedy\\" to its extreme seeped in. By the time I finished the book and sat puzzled over the complete change in tone for the last two paragraphs, I realized that Hardy had written one of the greatest pieces of satirical tragedy ever.Based on an actual inicident Hardy read about in a local newspaper, a husband, travelling on the road with his family, gets drunk and auctions off his wife to the highest bidder. After being offered a considerable amount of money, the wife is sold and she willingly leaves with the highest bidder, daughter in tow, as the drunken husband stays behinds and drinks.End first scene, cut to 18 years later. The man has become a teetotaler and has so righted his life, he has become the Mayor of Casterbridge. The wife enters the town, beautiful now older daughter in tow, looking for her former husband now that her husband-by-auction has died. They meet, work out a plan to remarry, and set about doing that.We then discover that the Mayor is already engaged to another woman. We discover that one of the Mayor's enemies is interested in wooing his daughter. We discover that the girl he believes is his daughter- has been told is his daughter!- is not actually his daughter. Discovery after discovery rain down upon us, each one forcing the characters to react in ways that while always consistent with their characters, creates further drama and eventually, tragedy.Hardy is an incredible author and even if this was nothing more than a tale about character and ethics, it would be an incredible read. When viewed as a satire of such tales, however- like an updated Job story without the God aspect, with the Mayor being Job- the work rises to another level. Hardy is funny, and even in the context of obviously serious works, there are occasional lighthearted moments. But once one grasps this complex work as a satire of similar works, Hardy verges on being hysterical. The Mayor of Casterbridge is a living character with obvious faults, but the heap of abuse that Hardy piles upon him in no way corresponds with his initital heinous act. Unless, of course, you're trying to be funny.Regardless of whether this is meant to be taken seriously or not, it is an underrated (as far as Hardy books go) classic.(And those last two paragraphs I alluded to above: their tone, syntax, vocabulary all sound like they come from a different book. To me, it sounded like Hardy was having one last laugh, foolishly trying to validate all the tragedy that occurred with two \\"intellectual\\" sounding paragraphs. One last bone to throw to those so absorbed in morality tales that they couldn't see that this whole journey was a farce.)"},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"Fast delivery and was able to enjoy with my daughter on a cross country trip. It came just as I thought."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"Nineteenth century literary classic, details a man seeling his wife and daughter and the long term consequence. It's a pretty powerful and deeply ambitious story, one that makes up for a couple feeble plot stimulators with a powerful psychological representation. What's most interesting is the protagonist, the titular individual. A man so committed to drunk and evasion that he will sell off his own family. Also a man that works across the rest of the novel to redeem himself from this moment, but not without much backsliding and fresh egotistical mistakes. He's also capable enough to claw his way up into a position of wealth and authority, but then later lose that fortune, and the book is quite effective in showing the degree to which his admuirable qualities are tied in with his core defects. He's far from a monster, and for all the damage his pride and spiteful rejection cause to other lives there is much to admire about him, his strength of character, his general optimism and the way he's able to come forth with strong ethical choice at the most surprising moments. He's an intriguing, complex and overall plausible character, most notably in the way that none of his grand transcendetal moments lack, the way he continually reverts back partially to his earlier ways.More generally, the work shows an engaging cynicism about the status of class, gender and hypocrisy in contemporary England. There are some very strong critiques in here against Victorian society, to the extent that I'm surprised it attained the popularity it did in its own time, and these are always coonected to an engaging novel. It makes me a lot more interested in reading the other nineteenth century literary classics I've so far neglected. And more Hardy, of course.Worse than: Crime and Punishment by Fyodor DostoevskyBetter than: A Tale of Two Cities by Charles DickensAlso better than: Jude the Obscure by Thomas Hardy"},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"The story of a man who ruins his life by doing the right thing at the wrong time, both in business and in his relationships with his wife, a potential wife, and his stepdaughter.

Hardy came after Dickens and before James, and his style intrigues as you connect parts of it to the former, parts to the latter.His plotting is sort of Dickens \\"lite.\\" There are mysterious benefactors, sudden tragic deaths, reversals of fortune, paternity mysteries, ect. His prose is cleaner and easier to read than both Dickens and James; \\"Casterbridge\\" scans better than \\"Bleak House\\" or \\"The Wings of the Dove.\\"The story begins when a pastoral laborer, in a drunken rage, sells his wife and child one evening (I hate it when that happens...). When he wakes the next morning, abhorred at what he has done, he swears off liquor and decides to make something of his life. The novel truly begins eighteen years later, when his wife and daughter come back to present themselves to him. In the course of the rest of the novel, we witness the fall of the now Mayor of Casterbridge, brought about by his own character flaws and the interventions of fate.Henchard, the main character, is a facinating combination of hot-spirited volition and turn-on-a-dime repentance. He is quick to do things which damn him but just as quick to admit his guilt. He is a wonderful character and a precursor to the later \\"psychological\\" novels of James and Forster. The satellite characters remind one of Dickens, but they are not nearly as startling and interesting, but of course, a character such as Henchard never existed in all of Dickens.The novel proceeds to its forgone conclusion inexorably, albiet with a few melodromatic touches, yet it sustains its tone and readibility due mostly to Henchard, and the dramatic situations Hardy puts him through.Well worth a look."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"Since I have decided to dedicate part of my time spent reading in 2003 to the classics, I started first with The Mayor of Casterbridge, not the most famous of Hardy's works but seemingly a good place to start. I will definitely read the other works by this author since I was so captivated by this book.The novel begins with the sale of Michael Henchard's wife and child to the highest bidder at a local summer fair. Henchard is drunk and his wife, tired of his habits, decides to leave with the sailor who bids on her and her daughter. Henchard wakes up the next morning, somewhat remorseful for what he has done and vows not to drink for twenty-one years.The very next chapter picks up the story nineteen years later, with the return of the wife and child into Henchard's life. Henchard is now quite wealthy and is such an important man in his community, he is now Mayor of Casterbridge. From here, a series of wrong decisions and misunderstandings lead to the devastating conclusion.Hardy is well known for his tendency towards gloomy endings and this book certainly fits the mold. But he is also well known for his lyrical descriptions of the English countryside and describing a way of life which had disappeared even in his own time. There were beautiful passages about the hay carts being driven through town, loaded so high that people on the second floor of homes could reach out and touch the top of the hay. Small details abound, describing the sound of rain on trees and the smell of the local foods. But perhaps the most significant aspect of the novel for me was the feeling that Henchard had wished for everything that had happened to him, and all of his wishes came true, and thus ultimately his downfall. These wishes were almost all made in a rash moment, when perhaps a minute or more of reflection could have produced a clearer head. Yet Henchard lives by his instincts, since for almost twenty years they seemed to serve him well.I would recommend this book to any serious literature lover and I believe it serves as a good introduction to his other works. His books serve as a bridge from Victorian literature to modern literature, with no happy endings guaranteed."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"At first I was forced to read &quot;The Mayor of Casterbridge&quot; in school more than 12 years ago. Reading it slowly made an impact on my life. This book always served a special purpose in my life. It introduced me to the wide world of Literature. It sort of enlighten my interest and liking for English literature. Now re-reading it not only brought back fond memories of my yester school days but also renewed my liking to one of the greatest writer of all time Thomas Hardy.Through this novel I came to the understanding of Irony and oxymoron. Hardy totally wrote with a sense of awareness of human characteristic and he had a amazing style of mixed humour with tragedy.His protagonist,Michael Henchard's life was under the microscope of Hardy.I love the way the story began I quote:&quot;ONE evening of late summer, before the nineteenth century had reached one-third of its span, a young man and woman, the latter carrying a child, were approaching the large village of Weydon-Priors, in Upper Wessex, on foot. &quot; I love the Englishness and the sense of intriguing events that would follow...In brief, Michael Henchard was a drunk who sold his wife and daughter at the fair. Later he realised his mistakes he work real hard and eventually became the mayor of Casterbridge. His life took another twist 20 years later when his wife and daughter came back to his life plus a few more other characters adding on the complexity of his life.Soonafter events unfolded and many things became to go against his way and then came his downfall. Indeed Michael Henchard's rise and fall were filled with compelling details and his encounters with numerous intestering people.What I love most about this novel was the way Hardy depicted Henchard's behaviours and thoughts and totally enhanced his weak character and irresponsibleness with dashes of ironies. His sardonic literary style were brilliant and at the same time he also vividly described the scenery and situations. Another greatest of Hardy was his ability to create innovative characters still account for in modern contemporary days and he was a pioneer in analysising human's weakness and blended it into his creation. It's a vintage classic,psychoanalytic and intriguingly written ,a must read for all books lover."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"I'm re-reading this book that thrilled me years ago and thrills me today. Now, however, I realize just how &quot;modern&quot; it is, even more so than the works of Dickens, whom I also revere, but whose writing had a quaint quality that actually makes him the lesser artist, in my opinion. Hardy's writing is spare but nothing is left out. You feel it, you taste it, you live it. It has the firm, sure quality of a minimalist work of art, and yet the twists and turns of its plot are dizzying. I detect its influence on novelist Toni Morrison, I might add. I'd be willing to bet she's a Hardy scholar. I read many passages, many scenes, that reminded me of her &quot;folksy&quot; conceits. And I was amazed at Hardy's contemporary understanding of addiction, in this case alcoholism. In fact, Henchard is a &quot;dry drunk.&quot; He abstains from liquor for 21 years, but his character defects and lack of spiritual awareness catapault him right back into his disease when he begins drinking again. In fact, his life spirals out of control faster and faster with his first return to drink, showing that alcoholism, like all addictions, is a progressive disease. A reviewer here said the book was depressing, and that Hardy is dark. However, the &quot;light&quot; in Hardy comes with his wisdom, not unlike Faulkner's, of human nature. There are so many themes of the enduring truths that one is uplifted just by the reading. Sometimes I mourn for the writers I will never meet, the ones who have passed on. Their teaching is so important to my own spiritual and artistic growth, that I have experienced a great love from them and for them. Hardy is one of those for me. Wherever he dwells now, I send him my appreciation."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"The Mayor of Casterbridge is not Thomas Hardy's most famous or acclaimed novel, but in the opinion of this die-hard fan it is his best. The later Tess of the D'Urbervilles and Jude the Obscure are generally considered his masterpieces, but while this lacks their epic grandeur and sociopolitical relevance, it is more immediately arresting, has a more conventionally interesting plot, and features one of literature's best tragic heroes. I give it the highest possible recommendation not only for fans but for anyone even remotely alive to literary greatness.Hardy in his day was nearly unique in mixing high literary elements with what would later be called pulp factors. Hard as it is to imagine, he was like William Faulkner and Stephen King in one - a true artist with mass appeal, both critically acclaimed and bestselling. However, his early nineteenth century rural English settings, heavy dialect use, eccentric vocabulary, and other characteristics make many current readers think his books slow going. The Mayor is the obvious exception, beginning almost immediately with one of the most arresting and unforgettable scenes in all literature - nothing less than a drunken man selling his wife and child to a stranger out of anger and disgust. As often with Hardy, it is based on a real incident, but he dramatizes so vividly that we cannot help being enthralled. The drama indeed reaches such a fever pitch in these first few pages that even those normally averse to classic literature can hardly help being pulled in.Such a beginning sets a very high standard, and it is a testament to the book's greatness that it never disappoints - and, indeed, hardly lets up. The popular aspects of Hardy's fiction made him more influential on later writers, especially mainstream ones, than nearly any other classic author; it is almost impossible to exaggerate his impact, which is such that even many who have never read him have been greatly influenced without knowing it. These strengths are present even in his earliest fiction, but The Mayor is the preeminent example. Supremely engrossing and intriguing, it is full of plot twists that will keep even the savviest readers guessing and ends in one of the most spectacularly memorable conclusions ever. One could not expect more from even the most entertaining pulp novel - and The Mayor of course has a wealth of great artistry to boot. To be sure, this Hardy aspect has always had critics bemoaning apparent overreliance on complex plots and melodramatic coincidence, the implication being that Hardy was unable to make a story without them. However, anyone even remotely familiar with him knows that he was intensely interested in coincidence, chance, and fate, using them deliberately to dramatize what dominated his thought. Those aware of this can see how well his writings work out the implications of his bleak impressions: that humans are near-laughably insignificant on the cosmic scale, that no force sympathetic to humans or generally benevolent controls the universe, and that human life is essentially miserable with little chance of success at love or other happiness. More specifically, his work illustrates what he called the Imminent Will - an unconscious force controlling human action. What seems luck or chance may thus be very much otherwise, though we can do nothing about it. Many have said that he has an almost malevolent attitude toward his characters, plotting so that things work out in the worst possible way and cause them the greatest possible suffering, but this is simply Hardy's view of the human condition. The Mayor's complicated plot is an essential example - perhaps the preeminent. Hardy was later somewhat unsatisfied, thinking that it suffered more from serialization's effects than any of his other novels. He worried that he included too many improbabilities and twists in an effort to include an exciting event in every installment but noted with satisfaction that the events arise naturally from the story, and so they do. Those who do not like this feature elsewhere will be unconvinced - or even have their view cemented -, but those for whom Hardy's tragic vision speaks powerfully will be in awe of the masterful execution.There are several keys to its success. Hardy reiterated over and over again that probability of character, not of action, is what matters, and this proves it. The book works mainly because its characters are so believable and often identifiable; we care about them in spite of - or arguably even because of, such is Hardy's skill - the highly-wrought events. It has one of Hardy's largest casts, and the four main characters are some of his most fully realized and memorable. Three are unsurprisingly doomed to near-constant suffering: the admirably strong-willed and hard-working but fatally impulsive Michael Henchard; Elizabeth-Jane, who has great empathy and love potential but is so passive that others constantly step on her with impunity; and the dignified but overly passionate Lucetta. The fourth, Donald Farfrae, is one of Hardy's most original and interesting. He was not one to champion a creation, but Farfrae is probably his most thoroughly positive and genuinely likable. Other characters are drawn to him almost irresistibly, and so are we; intelligent, industrious, and positively infectious, he is drawn with a good humor almost never seen in Hardy and gives much of the book's appeal. He is also notable as a sympathetic and nuanced Scotch character from an English writer.But this is of course mainly Henchard's story, and what a story! Hardy based his tragic fiction on ancient Greek models, but Henchard is his only true example of the tragic hero central to those works - a character who is in many ways admirable but imbued with a flaw that proves his downfall. \\"Impulsiveness\\" perhaps sums up his and is manifested in various ways; many know such a person, but the far more important thing is that we can see ourselves in him. He is in some ways an Everyman despite obvious flaws and has several admirable qualities, not least how he raised himself from extreme poverty to relative wealth and prominence by sheer force of will. However, his fall is even greater than his rise - in fact, one of the greatest and most affecting ever imagined. It is a true testament to Hardy's artistry that he makes us care for Henchard despite him being in many ways despicable; for him to win our hearts after the opening scene seems not only impossible but perverse to even conceive, yet Hardy pulls it off. There is much to dislike, but he is fully and thus frailly and tragically human. Whether or not we think him redeemed, he is more sinned against than sinning, as even those he has wronged eventually see. Yet he also undeniably caused his own demise; what seems like bad luck or wretched fate is really his bad decisions' delayed consequences. His end is one of the most highly tragic and sympathetic ever written; he dies miserably alone and fully broken, denied even the last ray of light that a guilty conscience and sincere repentance could have potentially given. The scene with his final note - complete with misspellings belying the lack of education and humble background that made his rise more remarkable but that he was in many ways unable to overcome - is one of the most moving I have ever read. It is the culmination of what is a highly emotional work throughout; Hardy runs us through a gamut of feelings as only he can. The pathos is at times almost unbearable, and few readers will not cry at least once. Indeed, aside from Les Mis&eacute;rables, which I believe is unquestionably the greatest creation of all-time, no other book out of the hundreds or thousands I have read has moved me so often or deeply. Other than Victor Hugo, Hardy has no equal at conveying emotion, and this is his supreme example. Later works, particularly Tess, show the tragedy of the human condition on a grander scale, but only Oedipus Rex itself even rivals this as a supremely moving depiction of individual tragedy. Indeed, I can say without hyperbole that nothing else I have ever experienced - artistic or otherwise - has driven home life's profound tragedy with such conviction or force.This alone is of course more than enough reason to read the book, but the work is also notable for other reasons. Chief among these is another perennial Hardy strength - great sense of place. Perhaps no one equals him in making place so vivid that it is essential to the story; setting is never mere background with him. He is of course best-known in this regard for Wessex - the part-real, part-dream country based on his native Southwest England that he made world famous. Setting is not as important here as in some other works, but the Casterbridge focus is particularly noteworthy. Based on the real-life Dorchester, Casterbridge is Wessex's largest town; nearly all Wessex stories and a considerable number of the poems mention it, and many take place there in part. However, this is unique in being almost entirely set there, giving both a fascinating glimpse into Southwest England's early nineteenth-century hub and filling in much of the background to other works. This is invaluable to fans and of considerable interest to historians and others.Relatedly, Hardy's work is well-known for showing modernity's ache, i.e., how technology and other advances were rapidly and drastically changing a society that had been essentially the same for a thousand years. The Mayor in particular portrays its effect on agriculture and other business aspects, depicting all with realism and human interest. Some current readers may think this makes the book drag somewhat, but it will be a big attraction for others, especially those keen on the background to the book and its importance to Hardy's life and thought.I simply cannot praise the novel highly enough; it is one of the all-time greatest artistic achievements, a supreme creation of artistry and, more fundamentally, the human heart. Suffice it to say that anyone sensitive to the unforgettable final two paragraphs, which sum up Hardy's grim but eminently practical view of existence in his fine inimitable style and conclude by calling happiness \\"the occasional episode in a general drama of pain,\\" will not find the sentiments more vividly dramatized anywhere. This is enough - perhaps even all anyone could ask for."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"When Thomas Hardy penned The Mayor of Casterbridge, he brought to life a very authentic character in Michael Henchard. He is possibly the perfect tragic character. The only other character I can think of to compare him to as I struggle to describe him and the story - for he is so much the story - is King Lear. But where Lear was a King who was foolish, Michael is the common man, a simple hay trusser, with several character flaws ... most notably shortsightedness and a desire to \\"be on top\\". He at no point feels something that most people don't but where we restrain our first rash and selfish actions (most of the time), he goes full out until he has cost himself everything and too late finds redemption. His flaw is insidious and all too common, so we relate easily even through his most outrageous misadventures.In a fit of drunken despondency, feeling that he is being pulled down by the responsibility of being a twenty-one year old husband and father, he jests that he would gladly part with his wife and daughter for the sum of five pounds. After having sworn this so vehemently for the entire evening, he has little recourse when someone takes him up on it and his wife, in shame and anger, agrees to go with the purchaser, taking their daughter with her. When sobriety brings full realization, it also brings a vow of temperance from Michael who in the following fifteen years builds himself up to a position respectability and public admiration in the nearby town of Casterbridge.Though he seems to have learned his lesson, we are only on chapter two and his story is just beginning as his wife and child return and his friendship with a trusted friend and critical advisor becomes a bitter rivalry. Time and again he demands allegiance when he need only ask it and return it in kind.Hardy's writing style is direct and straight-forward with no flourishes like you might find with Dickens or Twain. He has a story to tell and he tells it - no swashbuckling adventures like DeFoe or Dumas. However you feel about that, the character of Michael Henchard continues to skulk around in my head. He represents to me a very real possibility of personal failure and haunts my mind now just as Scrooge's deceased partner haunted him in A Christmas Carol. I would have given this book a fun factor of three stars when I first read it. Now I give it five stars because I have had the time to realize what a masterful job Hardy did when he created Michael Henchard."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"Having thoroughly detested Tess of the d'Urbervilles for its overload of melodrama and odious characters, I was hesitant to It often seems that to be considered a classic, a work must be both lengthy and tragic. Mayor is indeed a tragedy, but unlike start on another novel by Hardy. It was then a happy surprise to find that The Mayor of Casterbridge, though less famous than Tess, is an infinitely more enjoyable work.Tess, it succeeds in drawing sympathy from the reader. Thomas Hardy's irony is also much in evidence, and he comes across as quite witty. The result is a concise and interesting mixture of humor and tragedy in which characters are reasonably likable. Henchard is impetuous and comes to his end almost entirely through his own actions, but his actions are always motivated by realistic emotions and there is nothing overblown or melodramatic about his downfall. Because he is so human and flawed, it is far easier to feel sorry for him than it was for Tess, Hardy's embodiment of the perfect woman.There are, of course, elements in Hardy's style that do not change from novel to novel. His writing remains very Victorian and therefore rather ornate and longwinded. Nor is the melodrama absent from Mayor-- events often take on such an absurd turn that the reader is left momentarily with the impression of a soap opera. The plot relies heavily on coincidences, reminiscent somewhat of Dickens, and things work out so neatly and implausibly that incredulity must be firmly restrained.It is worth it, though. Beneath the superficial plot lie careful writing and hidden parallels. The elaborate Biblical Saul and David parallel with Henchard and Farfrae throughout emphasizes the unchangeability of human nature (the love/hate relationship between Henchard and Farfrae) and the cyclical rise and fall from power. Hardy also uses limited third person narration that allows the reader to know the characters and events only through their actions and conversations, further evidence of a meticulously constructed novel. In a refreshing change, Mayor moves along quickly with virtually no extraneous events.The Mayor of Casterbridge is an unusual book, and one that can be understood on multiple levels. On one, it is the simple story of the fall of a proud man; on another, it is a retold Biblical story, updated but not deprived of its original power. And though I never thought to say this about Hardy's novels, The Mayor of Casterbridge also does pretty well as entertainment...Ailanna"},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"The first book I read out of Thomas Hardy's many works was \\"Far from the Madding Crowd\\" back in my secondary school days. I immediately fell in love with Hardy. Reading \\"The Mayor of Casterbridge\\" only confirmed that my liking for Hardy's works was not misplaced. The Mayor of Casterbridge is absolutely brilliant as the author uses his perceptive insights into the human nature to create very realistic characters with complex personalities. For example, Henchard is an alcoholic who suffers from many of the accompanying afflictions that include low self-esteem, shame, guilt, self-castigation, self-punishment, loneliness, a death wish, and a tendency to depression.The book starts in the first chapter with a dramatic masterpiece that perfectly sets the tone and theme for the rest of the novel. A young man named Michael Henchard and his wife Susan and baby daughter Elizabeth-Jane enter a village where Henchard hopes to find work. They go to a country fair where Henchard, an alcoholic, gets drunk and sells his wife and baby to a sailor. Once Henchard sobers up, he realizes his mistake, and searches, in vain, to retrieve his family. Abhorred at what he has done, he swears off liquor and decides to make something of his life. The story unravels nineteen years later, when his wife and daughter come back to present themselves to him. In the course of the rest of the novel, Henchard who was now the Mayor of Casterbridge falls from grace, this being a result of his own character flaws and the hand of fate.I enjoy reading Hardy's impressive prose, which is strong, sharp and descriptive. The various scenes the author describes are filled with vivid and compelling imagery that leave one wanting to read more and more. Thomas Hardy is especially adept at describing the environment which he has a deep seated love for. The ironic twists of fate provide a setting that demonstrates the brilliant writer that Hardy is where he expertly weaves a plot that shows the themes of the balance between fate and individual choice. That makes The Mayor of Casterbridge very pleasant to read despite the sad story.For those who wish to study English Literature, The Mayor of Casterbridge is on the top of the recommended list. The book provides exceptional descriptions of England and its culture as well as exposing the student to themes of profound gravity and importance. The book provides clear and concise explanations, dialogue and emotional energy. It is well-written, is easy-to-understand and to follow."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"Having never read Hardy before, I picked this book at random off a list provided by my Western Civilization teacher. I can't help but attribute my choice to destiny; this is quite possibly the best book I've ever read, written by the single greatest English author in history. While some other reviewers have classified his descriptive passages as somewhat dull, I thought they were rather intoxicating; I don't know how one could not enjoy the superbly vivid style Hardy employs. It's impossible to really describe his writing to one who hasn't read it.The plot in Mayor of Casterbridge is compelling throughout. I read somewhere that the book was originally published a few chapters at a time in a literary magazine, and this is quite evident, as every many sections seem individually complete with rising action, climax, resolution, etc. Hardy still manages to integrate these individual sections without flaw and create a wonderful composition of the life of Henchard. As everyone else has testified, the conclusion of the book is moving beyond description- without a doubt the most affective book I've ever read. Be forewarned: this is a book that will surely leave the reader in a depressed and brooding state. Going by Kafka's standard, that a book should be &quot;like a suicide... an axe for the frozen sea within us&quot;, The Mayor of Casterbridge is surely one of just a handful of the great books in English literature."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"I can understand the polarity of opinion about this book. And you certainly don't want to be reading Thomas Hardy while listening to Leonard Cohen. Don't dismiss the negative comments out of hand - Hardy is probably not for all tastes.In my case though, as a student disinterested in reading, this novel turned me into a reader. It has a \\"heavy\\" style, but I think it was this depth that appealed to me most - that, and the obvious devotion Hardy felt toward his beloved Wessex (strange how this passion of the author for his countryside seems to me more forcefully written than most other stories where passion is thematic). Of course I have since read all the Wessex novels but this remains my favorite, and probably my favorite novel of all.Still, not an easy recommendation."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"Mayor of Casterbridge is a tale about a man named Michael Henchard and the mistakes he makes in life. It is really well written, Hardy has a skill for great storytelling. There are so many surprises and details, which you at first think at irrelevant turn out to be the turning factors of the entire book. Hardy is not one who puts in a lot of useless text, everything has to be thoroughly read or you will not enjoy it.

Thomas Hardy was a master writer, and look no further than the fact that he makes a story about a person that buys and sells corn interesting. But, the kindle edition is, like the title of the review says, missing a chunk of the text. There might be other parts omitted, but that's the only one I've caught.Perhaps this is evidence that you get what you pay for."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"Rather than repeat tired platitudes about this established literary classic, I'll simply describe my reaction to 'The Mayor of Casterbridge'. It made me nervous and stressed, dreading the next awful event that would follow the painful scene I had just finished, and sure enough, another calamity would promptly occur. Foreseeing its approach, I would want to put the whole novel aside, but morbid fascination led me to continue reading. That's the way it is with thrillers. At least most of the disasters befell the main character, a loathsome individual who, unfortunately, reminded me very much of someone in my own life. I thought I had read this book in high school fifty years ago, but if I really did, it affected me less then than it did now. Finishing the last page with a sense of relief, I gratefully turned to Anthony Trollope for my next read."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"\\"For my part I don't see why men who have got wives, and don't want 'em, shouldn't get rid of 'em as these gipsy fellows do their old horses.\\" ---The Mayor of CasterbridgeAnd with those words (and the act they inspire), Michael Henchard brings a lifetime of misery down on himself. The Mayor of Casterbridge is widely considered to be Thomas Hardy's greatest novel. It is a classic tale of the spiral and eventual demise of an essentially bad man. The story is rich with personal intrigue... sins, lies, cover-ups, love triangles, secret identities and so on... making it a continual pleasure to read. The regional dialect (spelled phonetically throughout) can be a bit cumbersome to wade through at times, though it certainly lends atmosphere to the novel.The characters are interesting and easy to relate to and Hardy did an admirable job of making most of them distinctly human: Michael Henchard is \\"bad\\" (as evidenced by the sale of his wife and child in the opening scene) but is also carefully drawn as essentially flawed and insecure, rather than a flat parody of evil. Donald Farfrae, who is as good as Henchard is bad, is also flawed in his own ways which adds depth to his character too. Hardy was obviously better at creating men than women because the women are a little more \\"Victorian stereotypical\\": the good ones are pictures of chaste virtue who can actually take ill and die over a nasty shock (puh-lease) and the bad ones are fat hags in bawdy houses. The women are certainly less interesting than the men in this book.The plot is nearly impossible to adequately discuss without writing a book of my own. After the initial unforgivable act, the book fast-forwards 19 years and we soon learn that the previously down-on-his-luck Henchard has made a success of himself in the rural town of Casterbridge, where he is a wealthy merchant and mayor of the town. At the same time that he takes on a quick and capable apprentice (Farfae), his wife and daughter reappear in his life. Farfrae proves to be better at Henchard's business than Henchard is, Henchard has to abandon another woman in favor of doing right by his wife and the daughter's paternity is quickly called into question. Intrigue, twists, turns and surprises ensue. And all the while, Henchard's selfishness, quick temper and poor-decision making contrive to bring about his eventual fall. It all makes for a very satisfying read... not as satisfying as say, reading about the Count of Monte Cristo dealing out his brand of justice... but it is interesting to see how things unravel for Henchard nonetheless.The Bottom Line: a very entertaining and complex story from the Victorian era. Worth a read whether you're plowing through the 1001 Books list or not.This review originally appeared on my blog. See my profile for details."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"\\"The Mayor Of Casterbridge\\" captures a lot of what makes Thomas Hardy resonate with people today: hard existential truths playing out amid pastoral splendor; naturalistic descriptions of fantastic events; an agnostic worldview that centers around a sense of Christian guilt and loss. The countercurrents create a lot of creative tension.But what makes \\"The Mayor Of Casterbridge\\" so powerful more than a century after its 1886 publication is its multifaceted, emotionally conflicted depiction of the central character. Like King Lear and Ibsen's Solness the Master Builder, Hardy's Michael Henchard has no one but himself to blame for most of the misery that befalls him. Still he compels sympathy and a growing sense of investment from the reader.We meet him, in one of the all-time great openings of noveldom, selling off his timid wife and child in a fit of rum-tinged pique. He regrets this almost immediately, but fails to relocate them. Instead, he swears off liquor and remakes himself years later as a prosperous leader in a town he chances upon in his travels, Casterbridge.Alas the dark spikes of his id are never far from the surface, especially after his wife and her daughter come to Casterbridge. \\"Though under a long reign of self-control he had become Mayor and churchwarden and whatnot, there was still the same unruly volcanic stuff beneath the rind of Michael Henchard as when he had sold his wife at Weydon Fair,\\" Hardy writes.Henchard is a portrait in grayscale, nothing too black or white. In one scene, Hardy shows him mercilessly humiliating a lazy farmhand, then tells us Henchard keeps the farmhand's mother stocked with coal in winter. When the wife returns, Henchard has a romance brewing but puts it aside to do right by the woman he wronged. He's definitely not happy about it, and prone to self-pity and lashing out, but Hardy's intuitive narration keeps you identifying with Henchard, never leading you too far from his point of view.For a character study the story moves fast, even if the prose style is ornate. Hardy's descriptive abilities are on constant display, with scenic rides through the country. There's much local Wessex color (Hardy's own quasi-mythical kingdom, where most of his novels are set) and a chorus of memorable townspeople, like a fellow whose theft of coins from the eyes of a corpse is excused thus: \\"Money is scarce, and throats get dry. Why should death rob life o' four pence?\\"Death is omnipresent in \\"Mayor Of Casterbridge\\", but Hardy justifies the novel's gloomy tone with a memorably powerful, courageously bleak conclusion. \\"Casterbridge's\\" greatness lies at its two ends. In between, the story keeps your interest but keeps hitting the same notes, with some sketchy melodrama and improbable coincidences amid brighter moments. Hardy even gets maudlin with a dead goldfinch metaphor.Most problematic of all is the absence of interest in the main characters beyond Henchard. Except for a jilted lover who forces her way back into Henchard's life with minxish self-possession, they are an entirely boring crew, existing only to be contrasted with Henchard's more forceful personality.\\"Casterbridge\\" may leave you wishing you chose something else to read in a lighter vein, say \\"The Painted Bird\\" or \\"The Bell Jar\\". But it's worth reading for that same emotional toll, a reminder of life's harder truths that may leave you sad but perhaps a bit more conscious of the truth behind the line: \\"There but for the Grace of God go I.\\""},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"In some ways this is a hard book to get into since it is set in a totally different culture from ours -rural England of the mid-nineteenth century. You would think that that is close enough in time to not be a problem. But to me the things like their courtship customs, or what is considered scandalous/honorable behavior, are really at a variance with the way we act today that I found it hard to relate to. Add to this some of the implausible melodrama and coincidences that make up the plot and I almost ended up putting down the book.However I kept reading and in the end I thought it was an excellent story. This is because it illustrated a truth about life that I could empathize with. How a man through pride, anger, stubbornness and alcoholism could end up destroying his relationships with all of the people he is close to and in middle age end up being alienated from everyone who was important to him in his life. Since this story was written there have been millions of guys like Michael Henchard. The details of their lives are different, their endings may have been different.

That aspect of the story is timeless."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"this is the first book ive read out of thomas hardy's many works, and i thought it was absolutely brilliant. he uses his perceptive insight into the human nature to create very realistic characters with complex personalites.each scene he describes is filled with vivid imagery that leave your senses tingling.i highly recommend this book to anyone that loves a well-written, easy-to-understand classic."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"I have not read any of Hardy's books before - and chanced upon this one, and found no regrets.

Traveling by foot with his stoic wife and baby girl, hay-trusser Michael Henchard arrives in Weydon-Priors during its annual fair. Having drunk too much laced furmity he makes an astounding offer to those gathered in the tent: he will auction off the unvalued females to the highest bidder! Fate protects poor Susan and Elizabeth Jane as the only bidder proves a decent sailor named Newsome. The simple-minded woman does not realize that such a contract is not binding, but remains with him--even emigrating to Canada for 18 years--until his reported death at sea.Somewhat sobered the next day Henchard feels deep remorse--to the extent that he enters an empty church and swears abstinence for 21 years in penance. Arriving in the major city of Casterbridge-site of ancient Roman ruins and some lugubrious customs-he works his way up in Society until he becomes a respected grain merchant and eventually the mayor. Though unwed he had a dalliance on the island of Jersey with a local girl named Lucetta, who nursed him through an illness--thus compromising her own reputation.The wheels of fate are grinding away when Susan and Elizabeth Jane-who may not be his daughter after all-arrive in Casterbridge. The latter has been raised in ignorance of the auction and Henchard's role in her life, but her mother is nervous, desiring to appeal to him quietly before deciding her next course of action and residence. On the eve of a big feast in town another newcomer arrives: a young Scotsman named Donald Farfrae, en route to Canada himself. Taking an immediate liking to the smart young fellow, Henchard convinces him to stay on and serve as his manager. Thus Hardy sets in motion the literary mechanism of a complicated plot: two men courting one woman; two women who are attracted to one man and eventually two men claiming to be Elizabeth Jane's father.There is a sense of fatalism in many of Hardy's novels; his characters strive against their destiny (the result of poor choices, as well as untoward coincidences) but they seem compelled to play out their dismal roles. Tragedy perhaps, pathos definitely. Hardy highlights the often unfair role of women in his society, set against a backdrop of snobbery, poverty, a strict class system and an undercurrent of superstition. A bit grim but satisfying for devotees of 19th century British literature."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"The Mayor of Casterbridge, Thomas Hardy's great novel published in 1886, is a classic of English Literature.

The characterisation are excellent and the descriptive writing is superb. I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"Thomas Hardy's \\"The Mayor of Casterbridge\\" seems to be a moral allegory. In a moment of drunken callousness, young Michael Henchard sells his wife and daughter to a genial sailor. When he awakes from his drunken stupor Henchard sinks deep in regret, and swears not to touch the bottle again for two decades. He searches for his family, and unable to locate them he stumbles into the town of Casterbridge where he develops a successful farming business, becomes mayor and the pillar of the community. Eighteen years later, when his wife and daughter find him the single and temperate Mayor of Casterbridge makes haste in reclaiming his lost family, and it seems it's all well that ends well.At the same time a young dashing Scotsman Donald Farfrae enters Henchard's life, and the Mayor is determined to make Donald his acolyte. It seems that the two have much in common, but Donald proves he is in fact the Mayor's polar opposite. Whereas Michael can be both generous (he pleas with Donald to remain in Casterbridge to work for him) and stingy (he fires Donald after dancing with his daughter Elizabeth-Jane), loving and brutal, brooding and quick to anger, Donald is the model of the proper Christian businessman and husband. Donald understands, forgives, tolerates, and endures all of Michael's impetuous insults and attacks, and he is finally rewarded with Michael's lover, daughter, business, and mayorship.But ultimately Michael Henchard is the protagonist of the novel, and while he is certainly petty, provincial, and proud his fall is both epic and poignant. Michael had eighteen years of quiet prosperity in Casterbridge, but the novel makes no mention of it at all, and Michael must endure one tragedy after another. It seems that Michael's undoing is that he thinks and feels too much. He is quick to anger and proud of mind because he is first to love and steadfast in his loyalty; in comparison, Donald Farfrae seems cold and calculating, slowly and methodically building his reputation at the cost of Michael's. Yes, Michael did fire Donald, but Michael had urgently pleaded with Donald to stay in Casterbridge and given him experience, connections, and a reputation: if Donald had truly been good and loyal he would have left instead of staying to compete with Michael. And then there's Lucetta who was engaged to Michael but eloped with Donald: this one act proved the irreversible destruction of Michael's fortune.If this is a moral allegory, and ostensibly it is nothing but a moral allegory it is not certain what is being said. Should we really aim to be like Donald Farfrae who is cold in his generosity and calculating in his fair-mindedness? And yes there really isn't much to be said for Michael Henchard's pride and anger, but there was also something concretely good and stubbornly noble about the man. He was also capable of reflection, and in the end he sought to do what was good, even if it meant disappearing forever. Look under Donald Farfrae's smooth handsomeness, and you'll discover guile and duplicity. Look under Michael Herndon's rugged vehemence, and you'll discover love and goodness. Michael Herndon has wronged so he seeks to do right. But having never done wrong does Donald Farfrae know the difference between right and wrong?\\"The Mayor of Casterbridge\\" marks a revolution in rural England, as the Enlightenment and Industrial Revolution finally begin to set in. Calculating reason and Christian piety seek to overturn the rural tempers and superstitions that have dominated the England countryside for so long, and so Donald Farfrae must inevitably triumph over Michael Herndon. Yes, with Michael Herndon's departure, the world has become a calmer, more reasonable, more enlightened place. But \\"The Mayor of Casterbridge\\" leaves us with a hanging question: are we better for it?"},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"This was an ok novel.

Like the plays of Sophocles, Hardy's novel proceeds directly from one mistake and misunderstanding to the next with very little padding in between. As a result, the plot can seem unlikely (as several below have commented). It's sad, however, if people reject it for that reason.This novel contains one of the more fascinating characters in literature. Michael Henchard is a man of the &quot;old school&quot; who conducts business on a hand shake and who constantly acts and reacts to the visible world. Despite this, he is often aware of his mistakes after the fact, yet is unable to use this knowledge to avoid future pitfalls.He's contrasted brilliantly with Donald Farfrae, who is a &quot;new man&quot; who trusts in the future. Ironically (and I suspect intentionally) Hardy make Farfrae seem a far shallower man than Henchard. Yet, the &quot;new man&quot; ends up on top.The end of this novel is one of the bitterest in all of literature. Henchard's will being an almost total negation of his existance. What could be more tragic than that for a flawed, but essentially good man?"},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"I loved the irony. I mean, how much worse could life get for the Mayor?

What follows afterwards, for Michael Henchard, is a life tinged by regret, even as he finds himself prospering in all other manners. \\"The Mayor of Casterbridge\\" is a compelling story of how falsehoods and regrets can overshadow one's life if they are allowed to do so.After selling his wife and daughter, Michael Henchard vows that he will not touch alcohol for twenty-one years and manages to build himself up to the position of a prosperous businessman and mayor in the town of Casterbridge. As he nears the twenty-first year of his oath, his wife Susan returns, finding him in his exalted position, and Henchard knows the only right thing to do is \\"remarry\\" her since they have been legally married all these years, and therefore make it possible for him to claim Elizabeth-Jane as his true daughter, not just step-daughter. Yet life has many secrets for Michael Henchard - some he keeps, like the fact he is engaged to another woman, and one shocking one that his wife keeps from him that will desperately impact his dealings with Elizabeth-Jane. While Henchard has prospered up to this point, a falling-out with his foreman, the Scotsman Donald Farfrae, leads to his eventual downfall in both his private and his public life. As evidenced by the selling of his wife, Henchard allows his quick temper to get the better of him, and he sets his mind on revenge to all those who have wronged him, whether acutal or not. Therefore, he constantly finds himself at odds with Elizabeth-Jane, with Donald Farfrae (whom he would like nothing better than to kill), and with another woman from his past who has upset his life.Michael Henchard is truly a tragic character, for while it may be easy to dislike him for his roughness and his callow actions, he is not entirely an evil man. His fault is that he regrets his actions, just usually too late. \\"The Mayor of Casterbridge\\" is a surprisingly fast-paced read, with a vivid setting and an extremely intriguing character in Elizabeth-Jane. The web that Michael Henchard manages to spin for himself is compelling and familiar, as these characters and their motives transcend beyond the time period captured so effortlessly by Hardy."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"...but without the histrionics.One of the greatest novels ever written. Also one of the most suspenseful and (for those whose palates have not been ruined by trash) one of the most enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"Reread this one recently - what a great book. This is my favorite of all Hardy's books. The fascinating part of this novel is the protagonist, because he is such a mix of good and bad. He has good and even heroic impulses and acts, and bad and even evil impulses and acts. The way he manages to sabotage the good things he could get reminds me of Lily in the House of Mirth, although Henchard's sabotage is due to through bad temper and anger and insecurity, while Lily's are due to ambivalence. But the trip downward is quite similar. Basically it ends up being the story of a man's self-destruction. What a crime that Hardy's novels were unpopular when he first wrote them, and the bad reviews discouraged him from writing more! I have them all but wish there were more."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"The Mayor of Casterbridge is undoubtedly one of the finest novels of the Victorian Era - quite a tribute given that the period produced a countless number of classics. The conflict between Michael Henchard and Donald Farfrae reflects a clash between tradition and modernity. This dichotomy is perhaps best encapsulated in their contrasting styles of record keeping; Henchard relies entirely on intuition and memory while Farfrae maintains extraordinarily meticulous accounts of all his transactions. Furthermore the struggle between Farfrae and Henchard reflects a conflict of vastly different temperaments. Henchard proves to be of a passionate temperament while Farfrae is rational and levelheaded. For instance, despite his modest means and limited experience, Farfrae boldly ventures into agricultural trading and through a series of shrewd bets manages to unseat Henchard as Casterbridge's preeminent merchant. In order to regain his erstwhile position, Henchard engages in rash and seemingly desperate speculation - in contrast to the prudent risk taking of Farfrae - that ultimately culminates in his ruin.While some AP students have chastised Henchard for his inability to overcome his animalistic nature, the more astute reader realizes that his inveterate character serves to illustrate a basic theme of most Hardy novels - the philosophy of determinism. The rise and fall of Henchard illustrates the unpleasant reality that one's life is subject to forces beyond one's control - in Henchard's case a deeply flawed character - and these forces often overwhelm the power of one's determination and ambition. This doctrine is certainly anathema to 21st century Americans who firmly believe in the concept of free will and a future holding great promise. While constantly lamenting one's ill fate is self-defeating, it would be naive to entirely disregard the power of destiny to shape one's life for worse as powerfully shown in the tragic tale of the Mayor of Casterbridge."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"The mayor of casterbridge is a descriptive, sad, but fun to read novel that keeps the reader glued to the seat. In this novel, Tomas Hardy's skill for describing the enviroment is clear, and his characters are vibrant and true to life. I recommend this novel to anyone who is in search of a great read."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"This is truly a classic tragedy, and perhaps Hardy's very best. The opening is one of the most memorable I've ever read; Michael Henchard gets drunk and auctions off his family. The tale spins off from there, boldly and without restraint. Though Hardy is a pessimist, he knows how to craft a story of unforgettable characters inspired by all sorts of passions- some taking whatever they can find for themselves, and some giving generously and unconditionally. Wait until you meet and get to know Elizabeth; she is a beautiful human being! I always learn so much from Hardy. I'm grateful that he wrote the novels he did before turning exclusively to poetry. This one in particular is so well done that I don't know how anyone can fail to be impacted and changed by it."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"A question about the source of human tragedy lies at the heart of The Mayor of Casterbridge. Characters frequently mention fate and providence as causes for tragedy (and joy), but Hardy offers more subtle and complex explanations for individual tragedy. At times, Hardy seems to indicate that circumstance and timing play a more important role than Providence in shaping the course of human destiny. Can people survive without the aid of luck or providence by pure force of will? Henchard (the Mayor) is a man whose loneliness, egoism, and pride cause him to make bad decisions. His faulty judgement certainly do not help him in his quest for fulfillment, either. Hardy's depiction of an ultimately unknowable universe is achieved partly through his characters' false assignment of meaning to meaningless incidents. Fate, human will, and faulty perceptions are central issues in much of Hardy's writing. Though not as moving and intense as Hardy's masterpiece Tess of the d'Urbervilles, The Mayor is not to be missed. Hardy's complex rendering of Henchard's multi-faceted personality is remarkable. In addition, The Norton Critical Addition provides excellent commentary and background information from noteworthy critics."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"In the novels of Thomas Hardy, tragedy can be an externalized force like Egdon Heath in THE RETURN OF THE NATIVE or it can be of the internalized sort, the kind that Michael Henchard brings on himself in THE MAYOR OF CASTERBRIDGE. In either case, nature is unforgiving, a quality which is a given in any of Hardy's works. When tragedy is of the latter kind, then the protagonist is not unlike the doomed tragic hero from classical Greek drama wherein he is first seen as a great or simply a good man who suffers from a tragic flaw, the results of which drag him down so that by the end of the action, his state is so miserably pathetic that the reader/audience can do no more than shake their heads in sorrow at his downfall, that in another and less proud man need not have happened at all.Michael Henchard is the post-Victorian man of mixed qualities who like Oedipus, commits a sin and then spends the rest of the book trying to make amends. His sin is maudlin self-pity. He allows his current debased financial position to lead him to drink, all the while blaming his wife and child. At an auction, he offers his family for the sale to the highest bidder. He ignores the warnings from those present that he is courting disaster. An unknown man offers the highest bid and off he goes, taking Henchard's wife and child with him. Hardy takes pains to place Henchard squarely in the middle of this somber farce. Hardy gives no name to the successful bidder nor does he allow the reader to note the wife's actions. She, surprisingly, remains silent, but weeping. Henchard, by contrast, is loud, crude, and obnoxious. He occupies central stage until the next chapter when he sobers up, is filled with remorse, and then tries to set things right. He fails and winds up the leading citizen of Casterbridge. The image of the drunken Henchard and the mayor Henchard are startlingly unlike. The latter is sober, industrious, and respectable, causing the reader to commiserate with him. But the tragedy of Henchard does not lie merely in a series of vain regrets. Just as he seems to undergo permanent rehabilitation of self, his ex-wife shows up again, with a new child from the now dead bidder. Hardy complicates the plot with his usual unwieldy complications. As a result, Henchard plunges again into the depths of despair; this time he shows that his old sins of false pride and egotism have returned with a vengeance. He tries to bankrupt his business partner Farfrae, for reasons purely of jealousy. It becomes progressively more difficult for the reader to maintain the same sympathy that they had earlier. Later, at the novel's close, Henchard is made to wander like a wounded Lear, and this alone partially elevates him back to his previous stature of a tragic figure. He, like Lear, dies repentant. From his death, the audience discovers that the essence of a tragic fall lies not so much in how much sympathy that protagonist garners during that fall but rather in how true to life his fall was. Michael Henchard was neither saint nor reprobate sinner. He was the Victorian Everyman with a mixture of goodness and mean-spiritedness, either of which could emerge under the right circumstances. At his fall, the reader saw that the \\"right\\" circumstances were sufficiently ordinary so that anyone of us might have done the same. This is the essence of the tragedy of THE MAYOR OF CASTERBRIDGE."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"Read this novel after Far From The Madding Crowd and Return of the Native. It's a very bleak and depressing novel - without the comic flourishes and moments of his earlier work.The story follows Michael Henchard, a hay-trusser, who sells his wife and child for five guineas in an 'auction' during a fit of inebriety. He spends the next 21 years regretting his action, but during that time he does well for himself, becoming mayor of Casterbridge, a rural town. Years later, his wife and daughter reappear. This starts a chain of events that leads to Henchard's fall. He eventually ends up losing everything because of his pride, passion and stubborness. The main character isn't very likeable, but there is something of the tragic about him that commands your attention."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"Mayor Henchard was drunk when he sold his wife and child. This instance of reckless cruelty would come to haunt him in his later years. Overall a pious and good man, his downfall was his reluctance to face his past. His will dictated his epitaph. He will never be heard from again. (The will is on the last few pages of the book.) Fading into nothing, it challenges the reader to find a term for death. Is death the physical end of life, or the emotional end of life. Readers will be challenged to determine their own answers to Henchard's damnation."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"This is a fabulous book written in classic Hardy style.

Although I do not feel it is one of Hardy's finest, it was, never the less, entertaining. It did not seem to achieve the level of pathos, or engender the concern for the main characters that \\"Tess of the d'Urbervilles\\" did. There were numbers of similarities between this book and Dickens' \\"Little Dorrit\\", except Hardy appeared to see how many mistaken innuendos, statements never made that could have cleared up false impressions, and misguided moralistic pressures could be fit into one story. All said, I am glad I read \\"The Mayor of Casterbridge\\". I enjoyed it very much, I just didn't LOVE it."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"I enjoyed this book. It was a good mystery.

Once you get used to the period of time and the style of writing ~ in old english, of sorts ~ one needs to continue this type. You get so much more out of a book that way.While this book may have been written in the 1800's I must say that the events taking place, the people and their responses doesn't seem to have changed one iota to the way society behaves today. This is a charming story of rags to riches to rags again. A story of humility, starting over, of pride, of desolation and back to humility again. It does have a bit of subtle romance, which keeps the story flowing.Both of the Thomas Hardy's books (Tess of the de'Ubervilles) and this one are wonderful stories and well worth reading.Interestingly it wasn't after I finished reading them that I discovered that these books were considered Young Adult reading. I guess someone rated it this way because it's a pure, non-smuttly book so ubiquitious of today's media.I don't care about the rating I just appreciated Thomas Hardy's contribution of literature."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"This is the easiest Thomas Hardy novel, but one of the most complex in terms of emotions. Being an English literature fan, I have to say that the story that goes on in this book is one of the most original and refreshing. If you found Tess of the DUrbervilles (another Hardy book) too difficult but loved the general storyline, read this, it's simpler for the simple minds out there."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"&quot;The Story of a Man of Character&quot; as described by Thomas Hardy is somewhat flaccidly applied to this novel. In fact, a better description of this novel comes from a colleague of mine, Professor Neale Scott of the Baltimore University, who remarked &quot;I realise now I had mistaken the dullness of Henchard's character for the dullness of the whole novel.&quot;. Ultimately, Prof. Scott is quite accurate in his assessment of the text. The characters bumble around, waiting for circumstance to attach itself to their groins, and do very little of plausible importance at all. Henchard himself is, without doubt, one of the most irritating characters to be placed in 'classic' fiction, and one can't help but wish that the death of our tragic hero had happened an awful lot sooner, such as before the novel started. The character of Elizabeth-Jane, wonderfully parodied by Helli Kitchin, of the Moscow State University, is so blase towards her constantly changing parenthood that it completely ruins any sense of empathy that the audience may have for her. The least convincing Scotsman ever can also be found in this text, in the form of Donald Farfrae, and I am inclined to agree with Dr Daniel Greenfeld, whose thesis, &quot;Hardy makes the heart grow colder&quot;, points out that the author would not know a Scotsman if one jumped up and bit him, a way that most of us admittedly meet them. To sum up - I discourage my students from reading this shambolic text. Avoid this novel like the plague - it is so soggy, you couldn't even burn it to stay warm. Attempt, perhaps, to read something a little more plausible with something other that a praetorian wanderer and an intransigent hay-trusser to tantalise the imagination, something that the author was obviously lacking - Wessex indeed."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"I loved the book! It is not for the faint of heart as it takes a little more time to read....the old English. The story is classic."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"This book is similar to a Dickens novel in that it seeks not to reach perfection, but to please its audience at the time. Like Dickens, it is very dry and filled with hard to believe coincidences that make the story hard to swallow. Still, Hardy paints a very lively, realistic and flowing impression of the English countryside in the early days, before the industrial revolution. I would recommend this only if you are obsessed with Hardy, if you have run out of books to read (try Fifth Business by Robertson Davies) or if you are forced to read this as a part of some course."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"Michael Henchard (yep - - later he's the Mayor, all right), having sold his wife and baby early in the novel for 5 guineas while in a drunken rage, gets what he deserves despite his valiant efforts at atonement years later after an initial rise in fortune and a 'chance' reunion with his long-abandoned wife and daughter. Not that an example of Divine retribution is Hardy's intention; Hardy was an atheist. But he stacks the cards so heavily against Henchard that it's hard to believe he isn't a True Believer after all. Chance? Irony? Coincidence? (Synchroncity?? Gadzooks!) Divine retribution? All grist for Hardy's deterministic mill, and a grinding mill it is for Henchard. It ultimately doesn't matter - - to prove his point Hardy orchestrates the narrative so obviously and nothing can stop Henchard's downward spiral, of course. Everywhere in the novel, it's plain he's doomed. Hardy created this character whose final wish, as Hardy has him spell out in his will, is that he be forgotten. And then Hardy titles the novel after him for the ages. Did I hear someone say 'Omniscient Narrator'? Pretty divine, I'd say."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"The book is essentially a daytime soap opera.

Although it may pick up later, it certainly is not worth it."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"I read this book for a class, and I am sorry to say that it was a disappointment. It is a silly tale, and totally unrealistic. I cannot believe that something like this could be considered a &quot;classic&quot;. Mike sure made some dumb choices, and it is unrealistic!

Sometimes his depressing stories has a message that produces a somewhat cathartic reading experience (as with Tess of the D'Urbervilles), but with The Mayor of Casterbridge all we get is utter negativity. This mayor is one twisted, selfish and self-loathing individual. He seems to live with a rain cloud over his head, and doesn't quite understand how it is to be loved. Fun guy? Nope. And there isn't even a happy ending.Bottom line: nice characterizations and fine prose amount to lipstick on a sow. Not recommended."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"I skimmed some of the longer descriptions of scenery/village life. There was still plenty to stir my imagination. This study of human character - especially that of Henchard - was very interesting. Really enjoyed the book!"},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"I was nearly put off reading this by friends who termed it \\"depressing\\". This trivialises it, for it is, to my mind, truly tragic. In a shockingly irresponsible drunken act, protagonist Michael Henchard sells his wife at a local fair. The consequences, stretching over a couple of decades, sweep away both him and other characters.The plot teems with journeys, coincidences, long-lost people showing up, and a strong vein of morality. In typical Hardyesque style, Henchard moves from the height of civic success to bankruptcy and alienation. A quasi-Greek-tragedy air of fate prevails, but Hardy manages to keep suspense alive. Protagonist and antagonist (Farfrae) are pitted against each other on civic and domestic fronts. There is not one Mayor of Casterbridge, but two, and success, failure and rivalry play a large part. There is also competition among the males as lovers, husbands and fathers.This novel gives an insight into civic life, the worthy burgesses of Casterbridge networking in their council-rooms and taverns. But the animal instincts of the wife-sale, the gutter-press viciousness of the locals' \\"skimmity-ride\\", and the proximity of the countryside, where so many Victorian characters wander to survive and to lay bare their feelings, reveal the fragility of civilisation and our urban constructs.Great stuff."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"I read this novel in English class, like most people probably did. It was one of the best assigned to us.Hardy is a gifted author. He writes in a clear style with vivid descriptions that really bring the setting alive, without making the reader (at least this reader) feel inundated with borning, unnecessary detail.The thing that I look for most in a novel, however, is quality characterizeations, and this book had them in spades. Dialogue was used effectively to flesh out characters. These are not stock characters, either. These people have flaws and shades of grey. They seem as though they could be real. I found that I could relate to the characters, and I did empathize with them, even when I didn't agree with their choices. Everyone had clear motivations. The characterization of Henchard shows that Hardy clearly understood the notion of the tragic flaw and the tragic hero/anti hero.Students who have to read this book as part of their English class may find it a bit on the long side. I would urge you to stick with it; once you get through the initial chapters the book will pick up (a commonality that all British classics seem to share). The book is easy to follow and understand. It is a key novel that marks the shift from Romantic Age to the Victorian Age, so it's an important read for anyone who has a serious interest in English Literature."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"The Mayor of Casterbridge is not Thomas Hardy's most famous or acclaimed novel, but in the opinion of this die-hard fan it is his best. The later Tess of the D'Urbervilles and Jude the Obscure are generally considered his masterpieces, but while this lacks their epic grandeur and sociopolitical relevance, it is more immediately arresting, has a more conventionally interesting plot, and features one of literature's best tragic heroes. I give it the highest possible recommendation not only for fans but for anyone even remotely alive to literary greatness.Hardy in his day was nearly unique in mixing high literary elements with what would later be called pulp factors. Hard as it is to imagine, he was like William Faulkner and Stephen King in one - a true artist with mass appeal, both critically acclaimed and bestselling. However, his early nineteenth century rural English settings, heavy dialect use, eccentric vocabulary, and other characteristics make many current readers think his books slow going. The Mayor is the obvious exception, beginning almost immediately with one of the most arresting and unforgettable scenes in all literature - nothing less than a drunken man selling his wife and child to a stranger out of anger and disgust. As often with Hardy, it is based on a real incident, but he dramatizes so vividly that we cannot help being enthralled. The drama indeed reaches such a fever pitch in these first few pages that even those normally averse to classic literature can hardly help being pulled in.Such a beginning sets a very high standard, and it is a testament to the book's greatness that it never disappoints - and, indeed, hardly lets up. The popular aspects of Hardy's fiction made him more influential on later writers, especially mainstream ones, than nearly any other classic author; it is almost impossible to exaggerate his impact, which is such that even many who have never read him have been greatly influenced without knowing it. These strengths are present even in his earliest fiction, but The Mayor is the preeminent example. Supremely engrossing and intriguing, it is full of plot twists that will keep even the savviest readers guessing and ends in one of the most spectacularly memorable conclusions ever. One could not expect more from even the most entertaining pulp novel - and The Mayor of course has a wealth of great artistry to boot. To be sure, this Hardy aspect has always had critics bemoaning apparent overreliance on complex plots and melodramatic coincidence, the implication being that Hardy was unable to make a story without them. However, anyone even remotely familiar with him knows that he was intensely interested in coincidence, chance, and fate, using them deliberately to dramatize what dominated his thought. Those aware of this can see how well his writings work out the implications of his bleak impressions: that humans are near-laughably insignificant on the cosmic scale, that no force sympathetic to humans or generally benevolent controls the universe, and that human life is essentially miserable with little chance of success at love or other happiness. More specifically, his work illustrates what he called the Imminent Will - an unconscious force controlling human action. What seems luck or chance may thus be very much otherwise, though we can do nothing about it. Many have said that he has an almost malevolent attitude toward his characters, plotting so that things work out in the worst possible way and cause them the greatest possible suffering, but this is simply Hardy's view of the human condition. The Mayor's complicated plot is an essential example - perhaps the preeminent. Hardy was later somewhat unsatisfied, thinking that it suffered more from serialization's effects than any of his other novels. He worried that he included too many improbabilities and twists in an effort to include an exciting event in every installment but noted with satisfaction that the events arise naturally from the story, and so they do. Those who do not like this feature elsewhere will be unconvinced - or even have their view cemented -, but those for whom Hardy's tragic vision speaks powerfully will be in awe of the masterful execution.There are several keys to its success. Hardy reiterated over and over again that probability of character, not of action, is what matters, and this proves it. The book works mainly because its characters are so believable and often identifiable; we care about them in spite of - or arguably even because of, such is Hardy's skill - the highly-wrought events. It has one of Hardy's largest casts, and the four main characters are some of his most fully realized and memorable. Three are unsurprisingly doomed to near-constant suffering: the admirably strong-willed and hard-working but fatally impulsive Michael Henchard; Elizabeth-Jane, who has great empathy and love potential but is so passive that others constantly step on her with impunity; and the dignified but overly passionate Lucetta. The fourth, Donald Farfrae, is one of Hardy's most original and interesting. He was not one to champion a creation, but Farfrae is probably his most thoroughly positive and genuinely likable. Other characters are drawn to him almost irresistibly, and so are we; intelligent, industrious, and positively infectious, he is drawn with a good humor almost never seen in Hardy and gives much of the book's appeal. He is also notable as a sympathetic and nuanced Scotch character from an English writer.But this is of course mainly Henchard's story, and what a story! Hardy based his tragic fiction on ancient Greek models, but Henchard is his only true example of the tragic hero central to those works - a character who is in many ways admirable but imbued with a flaw that proves his downfall. \\"Impulsiveness\\" perhaps sums up his and is manifested in various ways; many know such a person, but the far more important thing is that we can see ourselves in him. He is in some ways an Everyman despite obvious flaws and has several admirable qualities, not least how he raised himself from extreme poverty to relative wealth and prominence by sheer force of will. However, his fall is even greater than his rise - in fact, one of the greatest and most affecting ever imagined. It is a true testament to Hardy's artistry that he makes us care for Henchard despite him being in many ways despicable; for him to win our hearts after the opening scene seems not only impossible but perverse to even conceive, yet Hardy pulls it off. There is much to dislike, but he is fully and thus frailly and tragically human. Whether or not we think him redeemed, he is more sinned against than sinning, as even those he has wronged eventually see. Yet he also undeniably caused his own demise; what seems like bad luck or wretched fate is really his bad decisions' delayed consequences. His end is one of the most highly tragic and sympathetic ever written; he dies miserably alone and fully broken, denied even the last ray of light that a guilty conscience and sincere repentance could have potentially given. The scene with his final note - complete with misspellings belying the lack of education and humble background that made his rise more remarkable but that he was in many ways unable to overcome - is one of the most moving I have ever read. It is the culmination of what is a highly emotional work throughout; Hardy runs us through a gamut of feelings as only he can. The pathos is at times almost unbearable, and few readers will not cry at least once. Indeed, aside from Les Mis&eacute;rables, which I believe is unquestionably the greatest creation of all-time, no other book out of the hundreds or thousands I have read has moved me so often or deeply. Other than Victor Hugo, Hardy has no equal at conveying emotion, and this is his supreme example. Later works, particularly Tess, show the tragedy of the human condition on a grander scale, but only Oedipus Rex itself even rivals this as a supremely moving depiction of individual tragedy. Indeed, I can say without hyperbole that nothing else I have ever experienced - artistic or otherwise - has driven home life's profound tragedy with such conviction or force.This alone is of course more than enough reason to read the book, but the work is also notable for other reasons. Chief among these is another perennial Hardy strength - great sense of place. Perhaps no one equals him in making place so vivid that it is essential to the story; setting is never mere background with him. He is of course best-known in this regard for Wessex - the part-real, part-dream country based on his native Southwest England that he made world famous. Setting is not as important here as in some other works, but the Casterbridge focus is particularly noteworthy. Based on the real-life Dorchester, Casterbridge is Wessex's largest town; nearly all Wessex stories and a considerable number of the poems mention it, and many take place there in part. However, this is unique in being almost entirely set there, giving both a fascinating glimpse into Southwest England's early nineteenth-century hub and filling in much of the background to other works. This is invaluable to fans and of considerable interest to historians and others.Relatedly, Hardy's work is well-known for showing modernity's ache, i.e., how technology and other advances were rapidly and drastically changing a society that had been essentially the same for a thousand years. The Mayor in particular portrays its effect on agriculture and other business aspects, depicting all with realism and human interest. Some current readers may think this makes the book drag somewhat, but it will be a big attraction for others, especially those keen on the background to the book and its importance to Hardy's life and thought.I simply cannot praise the novel highly enough; it is one of the all-time greatest artistic achievements, a supreme creation of artistry and, more fundamentally, the human heart. Suffice it to say that anyone sensitive to the unforgettable final two paragraphs, which sum up Hardy's grim but eminently practical view of existence in his fine inimitable style and conclude by calling happiness \\"the occasional episode in a general drama of pain,\\" will not find the sentiments more vividly dramatized anywhere. This is enough - perhaps even all anyone could ask for.As for this edition, it is essentially bare bones, lacking even Hardy's Preface, though it has a bibliography. The dedicated will want something more extensive, but the work more than stands on its own."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"Michael Henchard, a down-on-his-luck, unemployed hay trusser, succumbs to the siren call of alcohol at a country fair.

Ravaged with guilt over his selfish, impulsive act, he swears he will not take another drink for twenty-one years.Whether his wife was indeed one of Henchard's problems is left for the reader to ponder as Henchard moves to Casterbridge, prospers wildly in business and eventually becomes the town's leading citizen and mayor. Henchard's wheel of fortune, however, begins to spin on a wobbly axle as Donald Farfrae, an enterprising young Scot travelling to seek his fortune, enters his employ as the manager of his business. At the same time, Susan and Elizabeth-Jane, re-enter Henchard's life believing that Michael Newson, the sailor who had purchased them some nineteen years earlier, has perished at sea. Henchard's life truly begins to come apart when Lucetta Templeman, a former lover, also moves to Casterbridge and, ashamed of her past romantic entanglement with Henchard, seeks to hold him to his promise of marriage!Hardy raises many issues but, not expressing his own opinion through an unequivocal direction in the story's plot line, seems content to leave these issues as topics for sober analysis by his readers. Hardy questions the conflict between the merits of tradition vs modernization. There is the enormous irony that Henchard's success as a business person seems clearly attributable in part to his tee-totalling vow but is founded upon the five guineas seed capital raised through the auction of his wife and daughter! Henchard seems to epitomize the constant personal conflicts we all face between decisiveness and strength of character as opposed to impulsiveness and stubborn bullheaded intransigence! One wonders whether Lucetta is flighty, coquettish, thoughtless and selfish or is she an early manifestation of modern woman sadly out of time and years ahead of the ladies around her? Is Farfrae to be admired or scorned for his meteoric rise to power in Casterbridge and his complete devastation of Henchard's place among his peers?Perhaps the most powerful moment of the entire novel comes with the discovery of Henchard's will and his words directing that the world leave him to rest in forgotten isolation and that no person mark or mourn his passing in any fashion. Once again, we are left to decide for ourselves whether Henchard's life should be pitied, forgiven, admired or looked upon with scorn and disgust.To the readers of the day, \\"The Mayor of Casterbridge\\" would have been perceived as a darkly pessimistic tragedy that might have evoked emotions akin to those raised by Shakespeare's \\"Hamlet\\" or Sophocles' \\"Oedipus Rex\\". A classic worthy of the term, \\"The Mayor of Casterbridge\\", certainly never cheerful or uplifting, is however many, many things - compelling, moving, disturbing, thought-provoking and poignant. Above all, it is worthy of being read and enjoyed by any lover of classic 19th century British Literature.Paul Weiss"},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"This book has everything fans of the 19th century novel, such as myself, love-melodrama, romance, secrets, plot twists, mistaken identities, rising fortunes, and, of course, a tragic ending. I can't give much away because the novel rests on a series of shocking revelations-each more shocking than the last!However, since the book begins with the most startling event of all, and since it is given away on the back of the book, and happens at the very beginning, I will only deal with that event, which is what drew me to the book in the first place. This will set the stage and make you want to read the book as much as I did when my friend told me about it!The main character is a certain Henchard who SELLS HIS WIFE AND INFANT DAUGHTER. That's right, he sells them! To a sailor! Granted, he is drunk. It's an intriguing study of alcoholism, although some men wouldn't have to be one to want to sell their wives for some beer if they could get away with it. Henchard's wife is understandably furious, and leaves with the sailor. After this, Henchard vows to never again drink-although the introduction to my edition suggests that he remains a \\"dry drunk\\". I don't exactly know what that that entails, but the introduction assured me that it was one of the first books on alcoholism which is important enough.Henchard then redeems himself and in Jean Valjean fashion would like to both atone for, and hide, his shameful past. He tries to find his wife and daughter, and that's where all the fascinating plot twists come in. It's very well-written and kept my attention throughout. I have also read \\"Tess\\" by Hardy and I like his writing style. I cannot say that his works moved me in any profound way as other literature has, but I'm not sure why that's important. There's a lot of humor and farce in this book which is first-rate, and I just enjoyed his protagonist-it's not easy to create one so believable and yet so interesting at the same time.Yes, there's a lot of melodrama, but who is to say that an individual like Henchard, with his addictions and his furious personality, wouldn't realistically live a melodramatic life? I'm sure all those who panned this book may have known someone who found a way to surround themselves with drama even in this day and age. All the book's drama is caused by Henchard and his mercurial personality-if at any time he'd played things differently he could have had a better life. But no, he had to be a lunatic."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"One of my favorites works of English literature. The opening \\"wife selling\\" chapter is one of the best in all literate, setting the major tone and themes for the entire book. The ironic twits of fate provide a wild, entertaining ride that shows off Hardy's themes of the balance between fate and individual choice in a non-didactic way. The Mayor must be ranked as a tragic character in line with Shakespeare's best work. A work that makes profound psychological and philosophical statement while remaining engrossing on every level."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"I began reading The Mayor of Casterbridge as an ISP (Independant Study Project) novel, as it was reccommended to me by my English teacher. At first, I found the book to be unbearably boring, but beautifully written. The language is something to be admired. But I soon became absorbed in the story, and I have to say it was one of the most compelling ones I've ever read. I might just say it's the best book I ever have read. And it's sad. I'm a 16 year old guy, and I cried at the end. I don't want to sound prissy, but it's true. And you will cry too, I'm sure. If there is one thing I can say to you, it's this: read The Mayor of Casterbridge. It would be a great injustice to one of the most profound stories of our time."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"For being written in 1886, this book felt surprisingly modern and completely engrossing. The twists and turns of Henchard's life enthralled me and though many of his actions proved him reprehensible, he was still somehow likable... Farfrae also was an interesting character, though Elizabeth-Jane truly stole the show. All in all, I was surprised at just how much I enjoyed reading this and I will certainly keep an eye out for his other works. Hardy is one of those classic authors that genuinely isn't a chore to read!"},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"Thomas Hardy's \\"The Mayor of Casterbridge\\" es a truly remarkable novel. Interesting throughout, it is the story of the rise and fall of a man named Mechael Henchard. Ay the beginning of the novel, Henchard is a volatile, twenty-one-year-old hay-trusser. He becomes drunk at a fair and sells his wife and daughter to a sailor in an auction, which originally began as a joke, turns serious.Upon realizing that he has sold his family, Henchard searches for them to no avail, and takes an oath to give up alcohol for twenty-one years. After the supposed death of the sailor, Michael's wife, Susan Henchard, and her daughter began a search for Michael Henchard, who has become the mayor of Casterbridge.The novel proceeds as many soap-opera-like events unfold. The unique plot-twists made reading the novel a very entertaining experience. An unfavorable trait Henchard possesses is not letting go of past mistakes. Although he tries to atone for the past indiscretions, fate always seems to catch up to him. These factors and others contribute to the downfall of Michael Henchard."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"Thomas Hardy has a reputation for writing bleak, sad stories. The Mayor happens to be my first Hardy read, and I can't tell you how saddening I found the overall tale.Many points are made by Hardy: dealing with the past and its haunting effects; pride before the fall; and even the folly of mental inflexibility.I couldn't shake the parallel of the King Saul/David story from the Bible while reading this. You have the powerful man who takes in an apprentice then becomes overcome with jealousy and envy as his apprentice eventually outshines him. And rather than putting his usurped life in perspective, allows his anger and envy to make matters much worse.I saw Michael as a flawed man who is redeemed by his sense of duty and obligation.I think the theme of duty to world versus self is important here. Michael's duty to his first family overrides his desire to be with his new girlfriend Lucetta. He probably would have been happier with Lucetta; but wouldn't we as the audience have seen him as selfish if he had chosen her instead of Susan? Both women were manipulative, one aggressively, one passively, so it probably didn't matter. But it does raise the question of how much of our personal happiness should be sacrificed for societal duties.Donald Farfrae, the Scottish apprentice is put here purely to provide Michael Henchard with a foil. I don't feel he is developed at all, and is kind of dull, as is Elizabeth Jane.There are character driven stories and plot-driven stories. And in plot-driven stories, you know that the characters' personalities or decision-making won't really matter in how things end. That's an aspect of Mayor...that some may find the most frustrating. You never could shake the feeling that destiny was unalterable. I, however, had no problem with it. It was a good ride."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"Opinions on this novel seem to be a bit polarized to say the least. The plot is a tad too complex and soap-opera-ish for its own good, but the twists and turns are interesting enough to keep people interested, and it really isn't a tough read. Additionally, it represents the transition between the more emotional, passion-centered Romantic era (Henchard) to the more mechanical Victorian Era (Farfrae), and that in itself is a pretty interesting concept."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"The story twists and turns and Hardy takes the reader on a journey exploring the hopes and shattered dreams of the book's central characters.This is a masterpiece.I, like many reviewers above, had to study this text aged 16 for school exams. At the time, I remeber thinking that the long winded descriptions of the countryside irritated me. Perhaps now, aged 28, I would appreciate this book more. I feel that those who criticise it are entitled to do so - but the criticisms (if genuine) ought to be more constructive than those above - which are just bitter and inmature!As a story, this is first class and a must. Read it and savour it."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"If I were ever to be an English Literature teacher, The Mayor of Casterbridge is the first book I'd start with. Not just because it's filled with themes of major gravity or features extraordinary descriptions of England and its culture, but simply because it's a damn good read. One reads it at a breakneck pace, occasionally stopping only when plot twists have one's jaw dropping on the floor. This is one of the most truly amazing books I've ever read."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"The Mayor of Casterbridge is a superbly crafted tale of youthful folly and the futility of repentance. Set in the early Victorian Wessex beloved of Hardy, the time and place still speak to audiences more than a century after the novel was written.The title character commits one huge act of drunken folly in his youth, to his eternal regret. He seeks to put it behind him and become a pillar of his community. But the consequences of his deed come back to haunt him and one by one he is stripped of all that he holds sacred and dear.The prose is so vivid and the tragedy of the ending so great that it is like being pierced with hot and cold daggers again and again as one reads the last fifty pages or so.Vivid characterization, realistic deeds, thought, and dialogue, and graphically depicted settings all combine to make this one of the finest novels in the English language.Even if you are not a Hardy fan, this novel is a must-read! The many TV movies and mini-series do not do it justice!"},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"Thomas Hardy's books are somewhat difficult to read, but this book, set in an English market town, is well worth reading to obtain a picture of life in rural England during that time period along with a complex tale of an ambitious man's rise and ultimate fall. A man rising from the ranks of farm laborers builds himself up to become a successful grain merchant and leading citizen of the town. Events of his past emerge to place a shadow over his success, and his greed and some bad judgement lead to his ruin. Like most of Hardy's books, it is a tragedy for the main character."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"I had to read this in book in high school and now again in college... and I hope to read it again in the future.

It has the pace of a thriller and keeps you guessing till the end. Who would have ever thought that a 19c. novel could be unputdownable? As you voraciously consume the book you may not have time to notice how the major character studies so typical of his other novels are compromised, lacking depth and detail. The end is disappointingly predictable."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"Hardy does exceptional work with his attention to detail. It keeps the reader entranced. The story of a man who, though he means well, always does wrong. Out of his love for certain persons, he ends up hurting them. Ironically, he hurts himself as well. The novel is filled with amusing dialouge, suspense, and plenty of sarcastic wit. I give this novel an 11 on a scale of 1-10! I definitely recommend it to all persons who enjoy ironic and challenging books."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"This book was writen with passion. Each word has an impact on the reader, and each page is a work of art. I've never read a book with more realistic characters or a more intense plot. The ending is sad.

It has to be read."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"The Mayor of Casterbridge focuses mainly on Michael Henchard, but it's the little characters that make the novel fulfilling. Their personalities clash with one another at every twist, making Hardy's plot twists all the more enjoyable. Personally, my favorite character is the Furmity woman who does her best to make Henchard's life a living hell. The court room scene is a classic!!!"},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"The bittersweet rise, and fall, of an irresponsible man.

He talks of man's selfishness and desires. He presents his theory, which states that man's destiny is no more than the product of his character and fate. In the wake of the industrial and intellectual revolutions, he gives us an idea of what man's guidelines would become. It such a wondeful novel, that is full of insight and wisdom. (check the death scene, page 123; it might be as well, the most elegant description of a human being passing away!)"},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"The Mayor of Casterbridge is a book of fate and tragedy. The story revolves around Michael Henchard who, under the influence of alcohol, sold his wife and child. This is enough to demonstrate that one mistake can lead to a life of utter misery. Although Henchard thrives and becomes mayor, his past comes to haunt him when his wife returns. Hardy's description of Henchard's downfall is unrealistic. However, what I found most unconvincing was the manner in which Donald Farfrae completely replaced him. The ending is moving, especially his will, and the book is beautifully written; but I shall always find the parts I found unrealistic the most memorable."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"Thomas Hardy's The Mayor of Casterbridge is a story about Michael Henchard attempts at redemption and the many sorrows, pain, and misery that comes with his decision to uphold his pride and name. To say that Henchard is the only character that suffers in this novel would be a misrepresentation; almost every character at some point suffers immensely in some trial of life, whether it is death of someone close, pain of separation, or the frustration of a relationship. For these reasons, this work is not a \\"light\\" read by any stretch of the imagination, and will probably test even the optimist's patience in getting through. Still, Hardy's story, the descriptions of the countryside and the characters' inner feelings, as well as the way he ties together every character in this book, is a remarkable feat and makes for a powerful read.The story begins with Michael Henchard walking with his wife, Susan, to the fair as they cross the countryside. While there, in an act of drunkenness, Henchard sells his wife to a sailor, and seemingly sets in motion his irreversible bad fortune. Not being able to find his wife the next day, he makes an oath to not drink alcohol for 21 years, the exact amount of years he has lived. The novel then fast forwards 19 years to find Henchard the Mayor of Casterbridge, and a noteworthy man of respect. Susan finds him, marries him after forgiving him, but there are many secrets that both parties have and will have until the end of the novel. It seems that many of these secrets are the character's downfalls. Henchard, while Mayor of Casterbridge, meets a man named Donald Farfrae, who he comes to like and implores to stay in town; however, eventually he and Farfrae become bitter rivals in not only their business and society, but also in their relationship with Lucetta, a woman who had an affair with Henchard in the past.Henchard's fallacy of character lay in his stubborn pride and his foolish belief that name and appearance is everything. He sometimes tries to create a faade, or cover up one sin with another secret or problem. When he tries to persuade Lucetta to marry him, so as to not destroy her name, he retorts: \\"But it is not by what is, in this life, but by what appears, that you are judged.\\" He is a tragic individual who seems to not be able to change his views long enough to make something right occur; when something does go well, it is short lived. He even gets to a point where he connects himself with an ominous and unpreventable fate, at one point referring to himself as Cain. He never really heeds Elizabeth's attempts at love until very late in the novel when tragic occurrences seem to be set in motion.Still, despite all his problems, and all his pride, he is a \\"likeable\\" character because he makes the effort at retribution and is sorrowful each time he gets hit with a dilemma or makes an unfavorable decision. He has the willingness and conscience to try to amend his deficiencies, but, in the end, he just makes too many mistakes, and has too much pride to reverse his fortunes."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"&quot;The Mayor of Casterbridge&quot; feels like something Charles Dickens would have written if he had been a more efficient storyteller, more economical in his prose, and had a better understanding of how humor is supposed to be applied to tragedy, if at all -- with subtlety and congruity. This is not intended to be a slight against Dickens, but rather a testament to the quality of Thomas Hardy's writing.The first chapter alone is a dramatic masterpiece and perfectly sets the rhythm for the rest of the novel. A young man named Michael Henchard and his wife Susan and baby daughter Elizabeth-Jane enter a village where Henchard hopes to find work as a hay-trusser. They go to a country fair where Henchard immediately gets drunk and sells his wife and baby to a sailor. Regretting his actions the next day, Henchard looks for them in vain, swears off liquor for twenty-one years, then takes up residence in a town called Casterbridge.Nineteen years later, Susan, now widowed, and Elizabeth-Jane track Henchard to Casterbridge. It turns out that in the intervening years, Henchard has become a successful granary owner and is now the town's mayor. He welcomes his former wife and daughter, proving himself to be genial but often petty and easily vexed. For one thing, he is in a bitter rivalry with a former employee, a young Scotchman named Donald Farfrae, not only in business but also for the affections of a vixenish woman named Lucetta who has recently moved to town.Hardy wastes no pages unfolding the plot, which is filled with Dickensian intrigue. It chronicles Henchard's relationship with Susan and Elizabeth-Jane after their return, his jealousy over Farfrae and Lucetta (who happens to be Henchard's old flame and inadvertently incites a public scandal because of this), his fear of the discovery of his deceit, and, finally, his feelings of isolation from Elizabeth-Jane and the town he loves. By the end, you realize that Henchard is not a bad man; he's a lonely man who's made the mistake of letting his love for Elizabeth-Jane distort his judgment.Especially impressive is Hardy's prose, which is strong and descriptive without being florid. He has a sharp ear for native dialects, and the dialogue of Casterbridge's inhabitants comes off as genuinely homey chatter rather than just dispensations of information set up to advance the plot. Moreover, like any good fictional place, Casterbridge takes on a vibrant life of its own, offering a realistic bucolic backdrop for this stormy human drama."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"An early fall afternoon in the 1840s bucolic world of Wessex. Michael Henchard, a young hay trusser, sells his wife Susan to another man for the paltry sum of five guineas. The 400 page classic by Thomas Hardy (1840-1928) goes on to chronicle the rise and fall of Henchard. The main characters are:1. Michael Henchard-The tragic Mayor of Casterbridge who loses all he values in life and all those people he loves to his rival. Henchard is a visible proof of the fact that fiction displays \\"the human heart in conflict with itself.' He is a Faustian striver who is ambitious in business as a corn chandler; politics as he becomes mayor and love losing the three women who have meant most to him. Henchard dies in an obscure hut near Egdon Heath desiring to be completely forgotten by the world. He has a death wish and wishes to achieve the oblivion of death in a universe controlled by fate, chance and irony. He is one of Hardy's great creations.2. Sue Henchard is the wife sold by Henchard to a sailor. She emigrates with him to America. When she returns 20 years later to Casterbridge she remarries Henchard but dies soon after the wedding. She is a simple-minded country woman lacking in knowledge and sophistication.3. Donald Farfrae-While Henchard represents ancient Wessex in folkways and beliefs, Mr. Farfrae is a young Scotchman who soon steals Henchard's supremacy in Casterbridge. He is hired by Henchard to straighten out the latter's business affairs but leaves him to start a successful rival business firm. Farfrae is the second Mayor of Casterbridge in this novel. He marries Henchard's mistress Lucetta. When Lucetta dies after being the center of a scandal caused by old loves letters to Henchard being revealed, Farfrae weds Henchard's stepdaughter Elizabeth Jane. He is a kind man who seeks to help Henchard to no avail.4. Eliaabeth-Jane-She is an intelligent person who returns from abroad with her mother Sue. She has been raised to believe that Michael Henchard is her father. Elizabeth-Jane becomes a hired companion to Henchard's quondom mistress Lucetta. Elizabeth Jane later weds Farfrae. This young lady learns her real father is the sailor Newson and Sue.5. Seaman Newson-The real father of Sue who returns to find her twenty years after the deal of exchange he made to purchase Sue as his wife from Michael Henchard.6. Lucette-The Jersey miss who had an affair long ago with Michael Henchard. Lucette is sexy and exotic. She weds Donald Farfrae dying after details of her affair with Henchard lead to scandal.The characters in this ironical novel are all puppets in an uncaring universe.The last word in the novel is \\"pain\\"! There is plenty of pain to share among all the characters.As with all of Hardy's classic novels, the descriptions of the town folks and the flora and fauna of Wessex are beautifully written. Hardy is the best regional novelist in all of English literature.The Penguin Edition of the novel contains excellent illustrations by Robert Barnes which were included in the original edition. A helpful chronology of Hardy's life; discussion of the textual history of the novel and a useful introduction by Dr. Keith Hardy are included. The novel is one you should read and enjoy."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"My second reading of a Thomas Hardy novel was every bit enjoyable as the first, if not more. Having a very limited background with this gifted author, it has taken years to appreciate his talents.The Mayor of Casterbridge starts with a very dubious event...concerning a drunken 'sale' of two persons by one Michael Henchard...bidding them a not-so-fond farewell; once Michael sobers up, he realizes his mistake, and searches, in vain, to retrieve his family.Flash forward 19 years, when a weary woman and her now-grown daughter appear near Casterbridge, searching for the woman's first husband, who has now become the mayor, and succeeded in keeping his 21 year pledge to abstain from drink following his grievous error years before.Susan Henchard, now the widow of a missing sailor, comes looking for Michael, and is surprised at what she finds. A sober, well-to-do, respected member of the community, and a leader. A far cry from the man who bartered her away years before. Also new in town is Donald Farfrae, who, once apprenticed to hay and corn merchant Michael, becomes more than Michael bargained for.To tell any more of the plot would be to deprive a reader of numerous twists and turns that occur along the way to the conclusion of this wonderful novel. Perhaps its due to a limited amount of experience with Hardy, but I found several jaw-dropping revelations along the way, and more twists than a television reality series.The story is never dull, nor is it mired in too much unnecessary detail or character introduction. Each of the 'dramatis personae' are well-realized, as is the notion that the past can always change the course of the future.For newcomers to Hardy's works, indulge in this page-turner, which is fraught with enjoyment. As this is a less 'dreary' tale than Jude the Obscure, I would recommend it as an introduction to Hardy's style...and a chance to meet a masterful storyteller."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"The Mayor of Casterbridge has so many plot twists and turns that it would not be an exaggeration to label this book as a \\"plot spiral.\\" With practically every new section, Hardy invents a new way to reveal some surprising (and sometimes not so surprising) twist to the plot line. Hardy creates a complex story about love, lust, relationships, economical hardship, family, shifts in power, and more in a beautiful and picturesque way. He concentrates so much on detail that it seems as if you are watching the events first hand. His style presents information as if you were reading it in the form of a play. He nearly always sets up the scene before beginning the action, which makes it so much easier to delve deeply into the action of the characters.Hardy also creates enormously dynamic characters that are subject to so many changes throughout the novel that they become like real people. The author's grip on human emotions makes his characters believable and easily loved and then hated. The fluctuating emotions of the main character, Michael Henchard, as he falls subject to disappointment in every avenue of his life is a true example of Hardy's gift for characterization.The contrast of the out-dated and underdeveloped town of Casterbridge vs. the complexity of the relationships that develop within it is brilliant and makes the reactions of the common townspeople to these relationships even more significant to the development of the setting and also the relationships themselves. Though not portrayed obviously in the book, the town of Casterbridge itself plays a very large role in the story. As Hardy thrusts outsiders from other cultures into this archaic town, things suddenly become very complicated and even more so when the newcomers begin to meet and mix together. The Scotchman, Farfrae, and Lucetta, the Jersey girl, as well as some others, react in such a way to the old ways of this society as to disrupt the harmony of this simple community, making this novel an avenue for Hardy to demonstrate his gift for rich dialogue and language, as created in direct relation to the character&#65533;s point of origin.Hardy has created a book about rises and downfalls of a small group of people and presents a very fitting theme about the events of ones life and how they affect everyone around them in death. I must say that I enjoyed this novel for its substance and complexity, as well as the timelessness of the general plot outline."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"At first, I was a little confused as to how Hardy could stretch what seemed to be a simple plot into such a long novel--especially because the story in blurb on the back cover happened within the first 50 pages. But the story is more than the blurb on the back cover. It is about betrayal, last wishes, the &quot;evils&quot; of drink, and how one mistake can affect you 21 years down the road. Hardy's fatalistic view, seen through Henchard, is, at times, enough to drive the reader crazy.Like many of the other reviewers here, I cried throughout the book. There are constant turns in the story line that at times uplift your soul, and then crash it into the depths of depression. This book is not an easy read though. There are sections that you will struggle to get through because it is dry, but then there are others that will keep you up at night rushing to finish.I liked this book slightly less than I liked _Tess_, but it was _Tess_ that made me buy this book. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"I remember having read this book in high school. I immediately fell in love with Hardy. (I was also fond of Hardy Boys at that time, so in my opinion the name Hardy acquired a special significance.) Unfortunately, though, I never liked another book by him quite so much. I've read Tess of the d'Urbvilles, Under the Greenwood Tree, Far from the Madding Crowd(which was perhaps his second best novel, as others here have affirmed), and perhaps a few others. It is strange, or perhaps significant that I remember the exact circumstance when I was reading this book. It must have been about ten in the night. I had cleared my study desk, and unlike my common practice of lying on my stomach on my bed to enjoy a book into the night, I sat down on the straight-backed chair at the desk to read it. Very soon, I was overwhelmed by the narrative of Mr. Hardy. My father came in to see what I was up to, saw the tears streaming down my face as I turned the pages of my book, and quietly went away. I have never before owned any story books- my parents told me to read out of libraries. But now I am 22, and have started earning some money of my own, and I'm going to start a little collection of my most beloved books, to pass on to my children, perhaps? And this is among my very best."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"The Mayor of Casterbridge, focused and simple the premise has been in itself, affords a quite convoluted plot that packs with events as the memorably niched characters play out their lives and unravels the novel. The book is riddled with a well-faceted theme of conscience: the purging of conscience and its reconciliation through an allusion to deceit and characters' shameless past that ceaselessly haunt them and render them despondent and guilty. The tragic actions revolve around one man who manages to establish prestige, wealth, and authority over Casterbridge and ironically the very elite status leads to the fall of the deeply flawed man.In a fit of drunken anger and delirium, young Michael Henchard sells his wife Susan and baby daughter Elizabeth-Jane to a sailor for 5 guineas at a county fair. Over the course of the years, though he manages to establish himself as a respected and prosperous pillar of the town from literally nothing, Henchard still affords a ray of hope in reuniting with his family, until he meets Lucetta Templeman who nurses him in America. Such black spot of his youth as wife-sale caused by his fits of spleen not only renders him ashamed of himself but also wears an aspect of recent crime: something that will shame him until his dying day. Behind his success is always lurking such shameful secret of his troubled past shielded from the public and a personality prone to self-destructive pride and temper.Contributing to the suspenseful nature of the novel is the return of the mayor's wife and daughter some 18 years later whom Michael Henchard believed to have perished at the sea. The sentimental reunion, which marks Henchard respectable 20-year abstinence from alcohol, brings about a heartrending revelation and an ironical sequence of events that irritate Henchard. The very truth cruelly leaves in him an emotional void that he unconsciously craves to fill. At the same time, the regard he has acquired for Elizabeth-Jane has eclipsed by this revelation. The new-sprung hope of his loneliness (or \\"friendless solitude\\" in Hardy's own words) that she will be to him a daughter of whom he can feel as proud as of the actual daughter she believes herself to be, has been stimulated by the (yet another) unexpected arrival of the sailor to a greedy exclusiveness in relation to her.All these ineluctable consequences of his past shameful transaction at the fair take a stupendous toll on Henchard and his conscience. He is also uneasy at the thought of Elizabeth-Jane's passion for Donald Farfrae, whose rising prestige and success in his independent business provoke in Henchard enmity and envy. Henchard quails at the thought that Farfrae shall utterly usurp her mild filial sympathy with him, that she might be withdrawn from him by degrees through Farfrae's influence and learns to despise him. The pricking of conscience subtly manifests in Henchard's solicitous love and growing jealousy. His fear of losing tie after the death of his wife is sympathetically understandable. Though he in his effrontery has been weaning Elizabeth-Jane from the sailor by saying he is her father, she understands that Henchard has himself been deceived in her identity.Lucetta Templeman, inescapably torn between her past disgraceful entanglement with Henchard and her love for a more refined gentleman, is also pricked by her conscience. In an impulsive moment, purely out of gratitude, Henchard proposes to the Jersey woman who has been so far compromised to him. But as the years gone by, Lucetta is more convinced that she has been forced into an equivocal position with Henchard by an accident. She has discovered some quantities in Henchard, who is either well-educated nor refined in manner, that irretrievably renders him less desirable as a husband than she has at first thought him to be, notwithstanding there remains a conscientious wish to being about her union with him.When Lucetta learns of the wife-sale, she immediately dismisses any possibility of being with him and realizes she cannot risk himself in his hands. It will have been letting herself down to take Henchard's name after such an ignominious scandal. But her past which she diligently seals, if not expunge altogether haunts her. The surreptitious history with Henchard becomes the torture of her meek conscience and the reconciling of which through a marriage with a second man remains also her secret alone.Subtitled \\"A Story of a Man of Character\\", Henchard's origins remain unexplained but he literally begins and ends the novel away from Casterbridge, where he achieves his prominent status ironically destines his downfall, through the lampooning and skimmity-ride. A psychological study, the novel accentuates the fury that causes him to lash out against both himself and those who stand closest to him. It depicts to the fullest the very self-destructive nature of the power that causes Henchard's fall, which is so obvious through his louring invidiousness.2004 (46) MY"},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"Luckily I have the physical book too so was able to read the missing bit.

The hardcover is appropriately decorated with motiffs of Casterbridge. The wood engravings by Agnes Miller Parker are wonderful and unique! Of course, the story reads like a tragedy - Henchard is certainly his own worst enemy. On the other hand, Thomas Hardy's prose is certainly wonderful reading, unlike many 20th century so-called literary authors. Hardy's descriptive analyses of places and characters are exquisite, including the historical aspect of the English countryside near Casterbridge. The secondary characters are varied, some solid and some weak in spirit. Henchard seems to use them all to his detriment and the detriment of others. Elizabeth-Jane and Farfrae give the story balance and in the end are winners despite Henchard's downward spiral.This review is not in any way a descriptive review of the book's story line. However, there are hopes that your interest has been peeked and that you will give this book a complete reading. Also, there are DVD's of this story which can be accessed on Amazon.

I'm just tired of neurotic English characters who are obsessed with class (are they ALL obsessed with class?) and destroy themselves due to inherent character flaws. Henchard is hot headed and makes bad decisions. He drinks, repents, drinks, spirals out of control. This is almost a clich&eacute; in novels now. I suspect Hardy might be lost or relegated to Freshman English classes as the canon grows and embraces more \\"diversity.\\" In short, Dickens' characters are more interesting. Forster's visuals transfer better to the screen thanks thanks to the Merchant Ivory team. I hope Hardy does not get lost in the shuffle because I actually enjoyed the prose quite a bit, although I probably liked his descriptions of the town and countryside and even some of the minor characters (that old \\"seer\\" guy who predicted the weather) who were more representative on a mythic level more than Henchard."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"A story of hope - from a lost cause to glorious circumstances.

The only possible reason that I can come up with is that people in 19th century England, did not have things like T.V. and so were absolutely desperate for anything to entertain themselves. This is possibly the most boring book that I have ever read. Nothing happens! I feel that a lot of people call this book a classic simply because some literary expert happened to like it once, and so these people, in a vain attempt to appear more intelligent than they are, simply churn out someone else's opinion, without actually thinking of their own response to the novel. I don't know how many copies of this book have been printed, but it is bound to be a large number, and all I can say is that it is a huge waste of paper which could have been put to better use elsewhere. I wish that I had not wasted some of my life reading this book."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"I have recently read this book (not out of choice) and I am at a loss to understand why Hardy wrote this and why anyone would willingly read this for &quot;fun&quot;. I agree wholeheartedly with the author of &quot;Classically Boring&quot; as this book is complete excrement. People are always going on about how we should stop cutting down the rainforest etc. and if this is what all those trees are turned into, then I'm with them 100%."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"I had never been so against reading a book in my life. Everything about it seemed boring; the cover, the title, and even the way the pages smelled. It was only the fact that Henchard sells his wife and baby in an auction; that kept my interest alive.Even with a premise as weird as this one, the book's beginning was painful. It wasn't until later on that I discovered the book wouldn't be as painful as I feared. The Mayor of Casterbridge is based entirely on irony and coincidences. Never have I rolled my eyes so many times in disbelief.Hardy created a soap opera-like world in the town of Casterbridge. This actually gave a humorous appeal to the book. After every major section of the book you can't help but mumble, \\"Sure...\\"Some people deem this book, \\"Depressing,\\" however The Mayor of Casterbridge didn't once give me a similar feeling. This book is presented in such a way that it helps you laugh at other people's misfortune.I wouldn't recommend this book as a \\"free-read;\\" But if you must choose between a bunch of boring books, and this one happens to be on the list, then I highly recommend you choose it. It may seem boring at first, but give it a chance; Hardy's humorous look at tragedy will give you a good laugh. I mean how bad can a book be, that starts out with its central character actually selling his wife and baby girl at a fair?"},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"Hardy was a naturalist in whose novels everything goes wrong. Michael Henchard is a drunk who \\"sells\\" his wife Susan and infant daughter Elizabeth-Jane to a sailor. Susan doesn't realize the sale is bogus because she is \\"simple,\\" throws her ring away, and leaves with the sailor. When he sobers up next day, Henchard searches all over for his lost family, and finally enters a church and swears an oath over an enormous bible that he will not drink from his current age of 21 to double that age. Meanwhile, and 18 years later, when the sailor dies, Susan, with Elizabeth, comes looking for Henchard at Casterbridge. He is now a corn merchant and mayor of the town. As a teetotaler, he is described as drinking glass after glass of water at table for a town hearing. Eventually Susan, via Elizabeth-Jane, contacts Henchard and he pens a note suggesting that they meet at the \\"Ring.\\" This last turns out to be a ruined Roman amphitheater or coliseum, a 1500-year-old relic full of ghosts and whose very name symbolizes the dark past. Henchard and Susan agree to remarry, playacting a courtship for public appearances, and to keep the daughter in ignorance that the sailor was not her biological father. After they marry, Henchard and the manager of his business, Farfrae, have a falling out because the latter shows the former up and makes a fool of him, making himself more popular than the mayor. To make matters worse, Elizabeth-Jane falls in love with Farfrae.Frankly, that's as far as I've gotten. I know how it ends for Henchard, but I won't spoil the ending. Hardy is a mean naturalist writer, and has no sympathy for his characters whatsoever. _Casterbridge_ was first published in 1886, when alcoholism was little understood - least of all by people like Hardy who didn't have the disease. It's all too easy for this author to condemn and be judgmental of alcoholic people. I would suggest for an alternative reading Eugene O'Neill's _The Iceman Cometh_, since O'Neill was himself an alcoholic and could rightfully speak for alcoholics. The subject, no matter in whose hands, is by nature depressing. All my editorializing aside, Thomas Hardy is a great novelist who has earned his place in the canon. His poetry is good, too. _The Mayor of Casterbridge_ is worth pursuing to the end if you're not an alcoholic."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"This book was originally written to be printed in newspapers, newspapers were then used to wipe one's posterior.

Good, but I forget the movie title. Both are very believable, which I like."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"Modern novels can be so pretentious, with their needless philosophizing and conscious experimentation with the language. So isn't nice to read a classic novel with straight-forward writing that aims for no insight into society or people? Actually no, it's kind of depressing. The Mayor of Casterbridge relies on coincidence, melodrama, and, as the afterword in my edition puts it, &quot;the constant exploitation of chance happenings to determine situation and hence the fate of his characters.&quot; I chose this Hardy novel because it was supposed to be character-centered. The story starts with Michael Henchard selling his wife and child at a fair. I thought this book would examine his redemption, it would be a Lord Jim type tale of profound psychological insight. A strange event like that is a good way to get a book started, but the crazy, unlikely events just keep a-coming. You feel nothing for the characters, ever. You learn nothing in the end, except life is cruel and if something can go wrong, it will. Read something else."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"&quot;The Story of a Man of Character&quot; as described by Thomas Hardy is somewhat flaccidly applied to this novel. In fact, a better description of this novel comes from a colleague of mine, Professor Neale Scott of the Baltimore University, who remarked &quot;I realise now I had mistaken the dullness of Henchard's character for the dullness of the whole novel.&quot;. Ultimately, Prof. Scott is quite accurate in his assessment of the text. The characters bumble around, waiting for circumstance to attach itself to their groins, and do very little of plausible importance at all. Henchard himself is, without doubt, one of the most irritating characters to be placed in 'classic' fiction, and one can't help but wish that the death of our tragic hero had happened an awful lot sooner, such as before the novel started. The character of Elizabeth-Jane, wonderfully parodied by Helli Kitchin, of the Moscow State University, is so blase towards her constantly changing parenthood that it completely ruins any sense of empathy that the audience may have for her. The least convincing Scotsman ever can also be found in this text, in the form of Donald Farfrae, and I am inclined to agree with Dr Daniel Greenfeld, whose thesis, &quot;Hardy makes the heart grow colder&quot;, points out that the author would not know a Scotsman if one jumped up and bit him, a way that most of us admittedly meet them. To sum up - I discourage my students from reading this shambolic text. Avoid this novel like the plague - it is so soggy, you couldn't even burn it to stay warm. Attempt, perhaps, to read something a little more plausible with something other that a praetorian wanderer and an intransigent hay-trusser to tantalise the imagination, something that the author was obviously lacking - Wessex indeed."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"\\"The Mayor of Casterbridge\\" ought to be the model of what a classic is not. Books deemed as a \\"classic\\" are said to be everlasting and universal in its message. This book does not spread its wings into our era, and it does not apply to everyone in some way, unless you've experienced paternity uncertainty and emotional neglect. The characters are rigid, changing without reason, and lacking practical emotions. Michael Henchard is repulsive from the start, from when he sells his wife and child, to his emotional withdrawal towards the young woman who turned out to be his non-biological daughter, to hiding the truth of who her father actually was to Elizabeth-Jane, so one cannot pity his outcome. Elizabeth-Jane, the non-biological daughter of Henchard, was completely void of personality. \\"Blas&eacute;\\" has more personality than Elizabeth-Jane. After a tennis match type life, of being flung back and forth between fathers, to marrying Donald Farfrae who one day courted her, married another woman (who just happened to be the landlord of the house Elizabeth-Jane was living at, at the time), and then realized his affection for her, Elizabeth-Jane would've been a prime candidate for therapy (how could she give her heart to men who kept being introduced as her father?), but instead acted as if she was a spokesperson normalcy. Finally, Donald Farfrae, a Scotsman, who was the poster boy for blandness, never really showed growth. He was always monotone, and I could not tell if he found Elizabeth-Jane's biological father to scorn Henchard, or truly help Elizabeth-Jane find the truth. I felt naught for the characters but purposelessness, and the story itself was uncreative and improbable. I do no recommend."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"I recently had to read this book as part of my English GCSE and I can honestly say that much paper has been wasted and our trees are being destroyed to churn out a book, which is quite frankly absolutly awfull. I also am very glad that I was not around to ever meet Thomas Hardy as from this book it sounds to me that he may well of been a manic depresent, also in most, if not all, of his other books they all end in a very sad a depressing way.

It's also a totally gripping story, abounding in reversals, romances and local color. Don't start reading it on a night that you hope to get to bed early!"},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"In Michael Henchard, Thomas Hardy created a tragic figure of Shakespearean dimension. The opening scene of a drunken Henchard selling off his wife and infant child at a country fair immediately establishes him as a rash and impetuous character. These qualities will return to haunt him and those nearest to him again and again as his fortune rises and falls.Henchard is contrasted with the genial and almost too innocent Scotsman Donald Farfrae who starts as his friend but becomes his rival in almost all things. Farfrae has an easy charm about him that makes him an unwitting competitor that stirs additional dark forces in Henchard as his rashness mixes with a growing envy.The Mayor Of Casterbridge is one of Hardy's great works alongside Tess and Jude The Obscure. Hardy's vision is dark and the relentless sadness in his work may put off some but in the end these characters he created are as strong as tragic figures as those of any writer in the English language.Finally Hardy's descriptions of rural England and the people who inhabit including their dialects of the time are priceless."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"Good literature provides keen observations in behaviors and psychology of human beings when faced with moral choices and consequences, and this book definitely is filled with good stuff. The main character, Mr. Henchard, is severely flawed and his iniquities are multiple, and yet, he also is so human and really hard not to have sympathetic feelings toward him in the end. The writing is wonderfully philosophical and dramatic, especially the last paragraph of Elizabeth-Jane's reflection on life is movingly insightful."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"Hardy mixes the comical here with the sorrowful so you're at once, entertained and saddened by the events; the largest event which brings on the sale of one man's wife and child to another; a moment which both liberates and destroys the main character through-out the story. Competition and jealousy figure prominently in the time line, which covers many years in the lives of a few sad people. You could say Michael Henchard was doomed from the 1st chapter. He certainly is haunted by his past to the point of no escape. And in fact, it's his past (as well as everyone who was part of it) that fuels the inevitable heartbreak to come. Casterbridge as a central location isn't quite as powerfully stark as Edgon Heath from... Native but the landscape does affect the players in similar ways. A wicked sense of folly usually dominates every novel Hardy has written."},{"Title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"This story STILL haunts me since first reading it in college, 20 years ago.

Everything he has built threatens to unravel when his dying wife shows up, almost-grown daughter in tow, seeking a guardian for her child.

Lombard Street might be difficult to read at first, but as with Charles Dickens once you get used to the style the tale is riveting. And his advice on how a central bank, as the lender of last resort, should behave in the face of a banking crisis remains valid to this day."},{"Title":"Lombard Street : A Description of the Money Market (Wiley Investment Classic)","review":"Can a book about finance written in 1873 be helpful in a world with complex financial markets and plenty of information about how they work? The answer is yes. It is not that \\"Lombard Street\\" is a classic that one finds quoted many a time; the reader's interest should transcend historical inquiry or curiosity; \\"Lombard Street\\" should be read and revered by anyone interested in the underlying, abiding features of financial markets.But what are those characteristics? Bagehot, then editor of The Economist, writes that credit centers on trust: \\"Credit means that a certain confidence is given, a certain trust reposed.\\" And, banks always have on-demand liabilities that far exceed their readily available assets. In short, credit works on trust, and the system, in the absence of trust, can fall apart rapidly.What follows from these premises is a careful examination of how the money market came about, what its uses are, how its operations are connected to trade and country's overall welfare, and, most importantly, how central banks can deal with financial crises. Written elegantly, \\"Lombard Street\\" is, at the same time, an introductory overview of the market and a trenchant analysis of its most salient features.But what makes \\"Lombard Street\\" timeless is that it deals with finance in its human form. Bagehot talks about power, prestige and perception as much as he does about interest, discount, and credit. Trust is based on institutions and people: the human features of finance-trust, anxiety, mania, optimism-are timeless and apply to the financial markets of the nineteenth, twentieth, or twenty-first century. That is why \\"Lombard Street\\" is an ever useful introduction and guide."},{"Title":"Lombard Street : A Description of the Money Market (Wiley Investment Classic)","review":"Wiley Investment Classics generally fall into two categories, tough and dreary reads full of information, and lively entertaining accounts which also educate. Unfortunately, Mr. Bagehot and Mr. Bernstein's text is the former. The book does an outstanding job of promoting the importance of a strong central banking system and the importance of strict credit control when combating financial crises. However, it does so amidst extremely repetitive and somewhat painful language. The authors provide outstanding quantitative and anecdotal evidence supporting their case, but they do so in such a way that makes the book a true labor to read.This book would be very beneficial to anyone doing research on, or working for some kind of central banking organization. Otherwise, I would suggest looking to any of the other Wiley Investment Classics for a more interesting and educational read about finance."},{"Title":"Lombard Street : A Description of the Money Market (Wiley Investment Classic)","review":"This is an excellent book.

I wish I had read it many years ago. But I have to wince at the terrible job Echo Library did in printing it.It's full of obvious missing spaces so that words run together, likethesewords.This happens on almost every page. The author, Walter Bagehot, includes some actual balance sheets from the Bank of England as examples. Yet Echo Library fails to align the figures into columns. Instead it appears as a bunch of jibberish.It appears that Echo Library somehow acquired a text file of the book, perhaps as a Word document or something, and then simply output that onto paper and binder, and then shipped the books, without even glancing at the results, let alone proof reading it.Also, apparently to save paper, the publisher made the type size a bit small, and made the page column a bit wide. That saves paper alright, and makes it a thinner book, but it makes it harder to read. But it's still worth reading because Bagehot is so good.MY RECOMMENDATION: It's an excellent writing by Bagehot, first class.

An excellent book, which I recommend to any reader."},{"Title":"The path between the seas : the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914","review":"Just finished the Panama book and thought I'd relay my thoughts. It's my third McCullough book, and they've all been great so far. This one I'd put behind 1776, which I really, really liked, but it was still a page turner. As someone who used to read a lot of history books in college and write a lot of history papers, I have tremendous respect and gratitude for someone who can give a history and make it as exciting as a novel at the same time. I read a John Muir book or two back in college that struck me the same way, but very few since.The book is a bit thick, as the Canal took a while to build and I guess a thorough telling is going to take a page or so. It is divided into several chronological parts, and these roughly correspond to the French years, the years in limbo, and the American years. It is well told and the figures, since they are mostly non-military, are of a type one rarely encounters in history books. The mood was set well, the attention to accuracy and detail seemed scholarly (I must confess I didn't cross check footnotes or anything, but I've never heard anyone complain about his facts), and as in the other books of his I've read- he weaves in quite a bit of narrative through journals and personal accounts and he does this about as well as anyone.It was a long, ponderous, obstacle-filled journey- and the sheer miracle of the engineering task probably still remains beyond the reader's grasp, but this book probably does a good a job of bridging that gap that one is likely to encounter.Finally, in this day and age it is worth mentioning, if you are looking for a good chance to bash the French, this really won't supply it. While they did have to bail on the little project, it was not through lack of intelligence or effort. Some of the technological advances came too late, and probably as important (and fascinating), the discovery of the cause of yellow fever (Yellow Jack) and malaria and how to deal with them came post-France. Of the many, many topics this book touched on, that was the one that most piqued my curiosity.A long read, but an easy and fascinating one. Well worth the full five stars."},{"Title":"The path between the seas : the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914","review":"A story like this one is invariably told along two narrative lines: technology and political economy. The first is the how what when where, the second is who and why. That's an oversimplification, of course, but hey - it's a short review.The technology story is usually the happier one to tell when it's successful. So we get the usual genius and statistics narrative. Couldn't have done it without those brilliant engineers who figured out how to move a ga-zillion tons of dirt out of the way and how to pour more concrete than ever before and how to build the biggest locks to date with a bra-zillion tons of steel. And so on.That steel, by the way, came out of Pennsylvania, whose Senator just so happened to have a financial interest in the building of the canal. Which brings us to the political economy of the story, which is, alas, not so happy. There's the phony little rebellion that created Panama out of Columbia with winks and nods and logistical support from the Theodore Rex administration. There's the appalling toll in human life, especially amonng the black laborers from Barbados called on to do the nastiest work.Would that the moral dimension of political economy could keep pace with advances in technology. Mr. McCullough does a good job of telling both narratives, perhaps favoring the technological one."},{"Title":"The path between the seas : the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914","review":"The history of the Panama Canal, and it's construction is very unique in itself. The references of all the French names (although I couldn't pronounce all of them) were very interesting and kept me hooked. I'm a history buff, so naturally, I like to read historical books.After nearly a hundred years of owning the Panama Canal, on December 31, 1999, the United States gave the Panama Canal back to the nation of Panama. When Europeans first began to explore the possibilities of creating a pathway between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, the nation of Panama did not exist; it was a part of Columbia.When prospectors discovered gold in California in 1848, all that changed the author, David McCullough writes in the book. The Panama Railroad, at the time, was the most high-priced stock listed on the New York Exchange. Building a canal through this area that would be approximately fifty-one miles seemed to be an easy situation for investors, but it turned out that it took over four decades and an army of workers to complete the canal. In the book it mentioned that enough soil, rock, and dirt was removed to build a pyramid a mile high.When the construction began, McCullough notes that the leader of the project was Ferdinand de Lesseps, who went bankrupt. After President Theodore Roosevelt orchestrated the purchase of the canal, the United States entered the picture. A revolution took place that removed Panama from the rule of Columbia.David McCullough is a very unique and interesting author and writer, and he kept me captivated while reading this book.The historical aspecets of the book are accurate as far as my research has gone on the Panama Canal. This book is just fasinating because of the history that is involved. When Theodore Roosevelt bought the canal and a revolution occured between Columbia and the United States, the United States won, and the canal became ours. But remember, on 12/31/99, we returned the canal to its rightful owner, the nation of Panama."},{"Title":"The path between the seas : the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914","review":"In my opinion McCullough's best book and one of the best I have ever read.

From the debate over the path and the method, to the somewhat disastrous French attempt, through the triumph of the United States' completion of the canal, this 600 page history moves fast. The technological (sea level or locks?), natural (the landslides and the annual flooding of the Chagres River), and health (malaria and yellow fever) obstacles were enormous. The scale of the project was, literally, unprecedented.

It shows that the canal connected a lot more than just two oceans. Although the vehicle of this true epic was the search for a useful canal, the story touched on so many other aspects of the human civilization than just the engineering of what should be a wonder of the world. The cheapness of human life (thousands lost), the human desire for conquest and expansion, the psychology of business and investment, revolution and international affairs, the experimentation in social organization (pseudo-socialist lifestyle in the American Canal zone). The reader should be prepared for multiple off-shoots and tribulations that are all connected to the canal projects.

I am so glad I did. It brought the entire experience to life for me. When I saw the jungle, the locks, the gates, the Culebra Cut, the Chagres River, and Gatun Lake, I felt like I had been there before. It was the best of history lessons as I knew very little about the struggles entailed with the building of the canal. And I was able to answer some questions that fellow cruisers had.As an FYI, I downloaded the audio book from my library, but found that there were just too many names and details to keep it straight in my head. I needed to see the names in print.I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the history of the canal, and especially for anyone who is going to, or has cruised through the canal.

The French government became involved in the financing, and millions of francs were spent and thousands of lives lost to malaria and yellow fever, before the project was given up. This brought about the fall of the French government.With some highly suspicious maneuverings by Theodore Roosevelt, the U.S. gained independence of Panama from Columbia and eventually built the canal after discovering the cause of malaria and yellow fever and taking steps to avoid it.The usual excellent writing by David McCullough."},{"Title":"The path between the seas : the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914","review":"Epic. Herculean. Grand. Ambitious. Formidable. Staggering. Prodigious. These are some of the words that come to mind while reading this hefty book, and yet none seems quite adequate. David McCullough has a rare talent for telling history like few can. The Panama Canal didn't seem like an interesting topic when I began, but by the end I was astounded at the history behind this enormous undertaking.There were many who suggested a canal through Central America but there was disagreement as to the location - as many as 5 different routes were proposed. The French were the first to try with Ferdinand de Lesseps, builder of the Suez Canal. Unfortunately, he thought he could make it happen simply by sheer force of his larger-than-life personality, and ignored many of the differences between Suez and Panama. The result was an enormous scandal which resulted in accusations of investors being swindled and de Lesseps' son going to prison.Teddy Roosevelt and America took over some years later, and the behind-the-scenes deal-making that resulted in the Panama site being chosen left me thoroughly disgusted. But the men who took over the actual work at the canal were an inspiration and the real heroes. John Stevens, the engineer who got the work organized; William Gorgas, the doctor who eliminated yellow fever and malaria as the main obstacles; and Col. George Goethals who completed the work - an enormous task. Without these men there would have been no canal.But he doesn't leave out the working men who did the actual work. He discusses the different levels of society that developed, from the white workers and their families to the Caribbean blacks who did most of the hard labor. He discusses the Panamanians and how they were viewed by the outsiders, as well as the politics of the isthmus (and the story of how the US helped a revolution to break Panama away from Columbia was pretty shameful). He goes into the details of the French scandal, the outrage in Europe, and the cover-up in Paris. He profiles the influential Philippe Bunau-Varilla and the politicking that got America into Panama. He covers the geography and geology and the different proposed routes, as well as the sea-level plans vs locks that were proposed, the construction of the locks and Gatun lake, the railroad that served for so long...This is an amazing and compelling read that I enjoyed as much as \\"John Adams\\" and it's difficult to sum up in a short review. Let me just say I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The path between the seas : the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914","review":"Having been a history major, I am use to reading history books for fun that bore me to tears.

I was surprised that once I got into the book, The Path Between The Seas, I enjoyed it so much I actually had a hard time putting it down.

I definitely won't be giving my mother-in-law a copy of this book for Christmas."},{"Title":"The path between the seas : the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914","review":"When gold-struck multitudes began streaming to California in the rush of 1848, a railway across the Isthmus of Panama was built in a hurry to shorten the trip. It was such a success that a ship canal seemed the next logical step. A French company led by the visionary Ferdinand de Lesseps began to plan and raise funds for a canal, and digging commenced in 1882. How much harder could it be than the astounding canal at Suez?The French initiative in Panama, at that time a province of Colombia, was dogged by deaths and disease, the relentless jungle climate, the unpredictable Chagres River, and the inadequacy of both planning and technology. The project was largely kept afloat by small investors dreaming of a success equal to Suez, but things fell apart in the early 1890s.InThe Path Between the Seas: The Creation of the Panama Canal 1870-1914, historian David McCullough works his usual magic. The early part of the book is heavy on personalities and politics, light on engineering; but McCullough turns it into a fascinating tale. The serious digging began when the United States bought out the French interests, got involved in a Panamanian insurrection, and signed a treaty (later shown to have no legal standing) giving them rights to the corridor where France had been digging. In 1904 President Teddy Roosevelt appointed John Findlay Wallace as Chief Engineer and sent him to Panama with orders to \\"make the dirt fly.\\" John Stevens took over in 1905 and began by organizing housing and transport, and most importantly, drastically reducing the incidence of yellow fever and malaria. When Stevens left the project in 1907, Roosevelt appointed George Goethals to the Chief Engineering post; Goethals completed the monumental project in 1914.This book is history done well. From politics to public health, from Manifest Destiny to mudslides, from Senate debates to steam shovels, from excavation to electricity--McCullough's in-depth research and storytelling flair will keep you up late reading, as surely as any thriller from the fiction shelves. The dream of a 50-mile canal joining the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans was bold; the determination and sheer hard work involved in completing the project makes a truly fascinating tale.Linda Bulger, 2009"},{"Title":"The path between the seas : the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914","review":"David McCullough makes the epic story of the building of the Panama Canal come to life in a way that few authors could. Throughout the long history of tranportation across the Central American isthmus (first railroad, then canal) McCollough focusses on fascinating characters like the brilliant but enigmatic Frechman Ferdinand de Lesseps, who built the Suez Canal but whose career crashed and burned in Panama. McCullough's skill as a storyteller simply cannot be understated. The book will leave you with a true appreciation of just how Herculean an undertaking the canal was. This book is simply one of the best works of history to appear in the last quarter century."},{"Title":"The path between the seas : the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914","review":"David McCollough is a heck of a writer -- a fact I already knew from reading his wonderful biography Truman. His skill does justice to an epic story of recent times: the building of the Panama Canal.This big book is necessary to tell a big tale. The effort to build the Path Between the Seas across the isthmus of Panama lasted from the 1870's through 1914. In a nutshell, first the French tried and failed to build a sea level crossing at Panama. This was in pursuit of a vision held by many national leaders in order to cut thousands of miles from the journey from the Atlantic to the Pacific oceans. The Americans picked up where the French left off, and after a decade succeeded in creating a crossing using locks and a man-made lake.What McCollough does so well is flesh out the above nutshell. It is a tale that would not be believed if written as fiction. The level of incompetence, misfeasance and malfeasance, wondrously peculiar personalities, engineering failures and brilliance, vision and size astound the reader and underscore how that age relied more upon enthusiasm, idealism and optimism in the pursuit of grand efforts than does our careful and measured era. The French followed the builder of the Suez Canal into the jungles of Panama. Tens of thousands of French families invested their life savings in the stock of a company that had no plans for the actual canal, very little good data of conditions on the isthmus, no idea of the amount of earth required to be removed, and no budget that would pay for the grand adventure. After spending the 1870's and 1880's mired in the jungle, losing tens of thousands (mostly black Caribbean workers -- the people who really built the canal) to disease and accident, raising increasingly more expensive capital in desperate gambles to stay afloat, the French effort collapsed. Shame, ignominy and jail awaited some of the project leaders. Their effort will amaze the reader -- that such an ill-conceived (that's too much of a compliment it wasn't even conceived at all beyond &quot;we'll dig it -- viva la France!&quot;) undertaking could consume much of the savings of middle class France reminds one of how susceptible people can be to charlatans and swindlers.Into the breach stepped Teddy Roosevelt. This story once again displays the Presidents immense force of personality, drive and integrity. Evidence strongly suggests he made a revolution in Panama to win that then Colombian province away from a country that could not come to terms with the United States on acquiring the rights to dig the canal. He then ensured, through the use of highly skilled and able administrators, that the organization, logistics, financing and authority existed to make what for years stood as the world's largest construction effort. Great credit for the actual building goes to several engineers and their staff -- many US Army engineers. The success also greatly rested on Col. Gorgas and his partially successful efforts to battle disease: yellow fever, malaria and a host of others that had cost upwards of 200 of every thousand the French employed a generation earlier.McCollough brings scores of fascinating personalities to light. He tells of the financial and great political battles that attended all of the stages of the canal effort. The engineering and workings of the canal are simply and clearly laid out. The important efforts to improve sanitation and fight the mosquito borne diseases are succinctly explained. All of these elements are rendered interesting and tightly woven in this very good book."},{"Title":"The path between the seas : the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914","review":"&quot;The Path Between the Seas&quot; is narrative history at its best - the story of perhaps the greatest engineering feat of modern times. Writing in the clear and lucid style for which he is noted, historian David McCullough traces the creation of the Panama Canal from its earliest inception by the French in 1870, to its completion 44 years later by the United States.McCullough skillfully weaves personalities and events together to create a powerful narrative replete with political intrigue, financial scandal, and triumph over tremendous adversity. The author first acquaints the reader with the leaders of the French attempt to build the canal - Ferdinand de Lesseps and his son, Charles, and Phillippe Bunau-Varilla, among others - and tells of the ultimate failure of their venture, and their disgrace due to financial scandal. McCullough then chronicles the ultimately successful American attempt to build the canal. Here is seen the political intrigue (the U.S. backed Panamanian revolution against Colombia, with the complicity of President Theodore Roosevelt, Secretary of State John Hay, and Bunau-Varilla); the successful war against yellow fever and malaria, led by American doctor William Gorgas; and the organizational and engineering genius of two American Chief Engineers - John Stevens and Colonel George Goethals - which led to the completion of the canal in 1914.&quot;The Path Between the Seas&quot; is more than just the story of how the Panama Canal was built; it is a well researched, historically accurate, and at the same time lively and highly entertaining account of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The path between the seas : the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914","review":"McCullough is a master of the English language. This was my first non-biography of his and though it was very entertaining, it was not quite as captivating as his John Adams or Truman. The book is divided naturally into the French effort and the American effort, with ample interlocking references. Fleshing out the individual principal characters is McCullough's strong suit, and as always, they seem to come alive in this book. Research is complete and lends just enough detail without becoming too tedious. The book seems to end rather abruptly, but then again that seems to be historically accurate, as much of the fanfare was lost in the European conflict that had erupted just as the Canal was opened. In any case, this is a job well done and a book worth reading."},{"Title":"The path between the seas : the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914","review":"I hold a personal interest in the Canal as I have just visited it and am a direct descendant of Col. David Gaillard one of the American engineers of the Canal, and all everyone in Panama told me was to read Mr. McCullough's account of its creation. As a history major in school, I read many great and many bland histories; this book ranks in as one of the most captivating books I have read, fiction or non-fiction. Even if one does not have any previous interest in the Canal, after the first pages you will become hooked. McCullough writes with such elegant prose and interesting humor, that the story unfolds like a Victorian novel. From the incredible cast of characters (from Ferdinand de Lessups to Teddy Roosevelt), the intrigue, the conspiracies, the romance, the quest for one of Man's greatest achievements explodes into an incredible book that will keep the reader thinking about the Canal for years to come...and will compel the same reader to venture to this tropical country and view the incredible &quot;8th Wonder of the World&quot; himself."},{"Title":"The path between the seas : the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914","review":"Definitely an extremely well-researched and well-written tome but about three-quarters of the book is about the politics and planning prior to the actual building of the canal. If that's what you are looking for, I'm sure you will enjoy it. I was hoping for more discussion of the creation of the canal community and the engineering of the canal and locks. A lot of reading to get to that portion of the book. Additionally, I think the book would have been served better with more maps and diagrams of the canal.Also, keep in mind that the book was written in the mid(?)-70's so the history from the past thirty years is not included. A minor point, I know, but perhaps worth mentioning."},{"Title":"The path between the seas : the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914","review":"I found Mr. McCullough's book about the building of the Panama Canal to be well written, extra-well researched, and highly entertaining! I would recommend this book to anyone who truly wants to know what it took to build such an engineering marvel. Having lived in Panama twice and visited on many occasions, I can attest to the fact Mr. McCullough's book is THE SOURCE for accurate information on the canal and it's builders (both French and American efforts). I would also recommend purchasing the NOVA video, which Mr. McCullough narrates, called &quot;A Man, A Plan, A Canal, Panama&quot;. He even quotes out of his own book on screen! I've never read a book so intricately and fastidiously researched. MUST READING for the true Canal enthusiast."},{"Title":"The path between the seas : the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914","review":"The Panama Canal represents one of the great battles between man and nature and is truly one of the wonders of human achievement, especially when one considers the technology available at the time it was built. The Path Between the Seas chronicles the many difficulties faced, as well as the men and the scientific advances that eventually overcame those challenges.Ultimately this is more of a history lesson than an engineering textbook. While McCullough does an admirable job of describing the massive excavation operations, that is but a small part of what occurred during the 44-year period the book covers. McCullough grants the reader an insider's view of the \\"revolution\\" that created the independent nation of Panama and paints a vivid picture of what life was like during the construction period. He also brings attention to the individuals who played a major role in the eventual success of the endeavor, from the men who governed the canal zone to the physicians who discovered, and virtually eradicated, the causes of some of the worst tropical diseases of the time. The book includes a number of maps and photographs that help illustrate the narrative.Interestingly, much of the book takes place far from Panama. Shortly after the close of the Civil War the United States and other powers began surveying Central America with an eye towards building a canal there. In a time before satellites or aircraft this proved to be a demanding and deadly undertaking. Despite the relatively short distance across the Isthmus at Panama, this was not the only location considered for a canal. In fact, Panama was widely considered to be the wrong place to build the canal. An abundance of back-room deals and propaganda campaigns had to take place in both France and the United States to turn a Panama canal into a reality.The Path Between the Seas is a well-written book that I would recommend to others with the caveat that this is a long, densely packed book that is likely to appeal primarily to those with a strong interest in history."},{"Title":"The path between the seas : the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914","review":"I cannot say enough good things about David McCullough. &quot;The Path Between The Seas&quot; is my third McCullough book (&quot;Mornings on Horseback&quot; and &quot;Truman&quot;) and is a masterpiece. &quot;The Great Bridge&quot; is next on my list."},{"Title":"The path between the seas : the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914","review":"So riveting is David McCullough's account of the construction of the Panama Canal, that it is one of the few works of nonfiction outside of the sciences that I have read twice. He chrnoicles a mesmerizing saga of despair and triumph, starting with Ferdinand de Lesseps disastrous attempt at building a sea level canal through the disease-infested jungles of Panama. The second half covers the American effort at building the Panama Canal, a project as grandiose as developing the atomic bomb or landing men on the moon. McCullough describes the groundbreaking work of Dr. Gorgas' team of doctors and nurses in combatting malaria and yellow fever; their success made possible the canal's eventual completion by U. S. Army engineer George Goethals. While McCullough does a splendid job in providing facts and figures with his graceful prose, he also excels in recounting the lives of many of the prominent figures associated with the Panama Canal's construction. For example, McCullough describes General Goethals' substantial role after the United States' entry into World War I and his subsequent work as the first chief engineer of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Indeed, if there is a hero in this saga, it most certainly has to be General Goethals. Along with McCullough's history of the Brooklyn Bridge's construction, this has to rank as one of the most spellbinding tales written about American technological ingenuity in the late 19th and early 20th centuries."},{"Title":"The path between the seas : the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914","review":"Im panamanian, and no other book has been so enlightning about the history of my own country as The Path Between the Seas.It's a history lesson, and with simple descriptions it pefectly describes the amazing work and creativity men in the past had to develop to fulfill the dream of a Canal connecting the two oceans.I live in the Old City, (Catedral) and is very gratifiying to read of places and buildings that I see everyday. Makes one proud about all the history and histortical and cultural importance our city has.In short words, the book is a great read, very enlighting on historical facts, and a must-read for anyone even considering visiting Panama."},{"Title":"The path between the seas : the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914","review":"This is an outstanding book, not just for anyone interested in the Panama Canal, but for anyone who likes a good story.As usual, McCullough has exhaustively researched his topic, but this book more than others of his that I have read (biographies of John Adams and Harry Truman) adds a tangible sense of drama.I picked up Path Between the Seas at the library on a lark, but after reading the first 100 pages I decided that this was a book I wanted on my bookshelf and bought my own copy."},{"Title":"The path between the seas : the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914","review":"The Path Between the Seas by David McCullough is an excellent book which details the time period from the Gold Rush to the French involvement of the canal and through to the completion of the Panama Canal in the 2nd decade of the 1900's.This book in very efficient prose details why the canal's location is in Panama versus Mexico or Nicaragua. This is a bit of history that I was completely unaware of. It is also quite interesting to read about France's involvement and how they (surprise, surprise) failed in their attempt to achieve the successes they enjoyed in the building of the Suez Canal.Mr. McCullough is also quite thorough in detailing the politics behind the building of the canal during that time period.The yellow fever and malaria eradication campaigns were instrumental in the success that the Americans enjoyed. The author does a good job in acknowledging the successes but not trivializing the very substantial loss of life suffered by the immigrant workers primarily from the West Indies. America did build the canal (and President Carter essentially gave it away), but it came at a heavy price monetarily and otherwise.Excellent book and a definitive resource for the layman."},{"Title":"The path between the seas : the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914","review":"I first read a borrowed copy of this this book some fifteen years ago and bought a copy for myself (since re-read, at least in part, several times)some six years ago when based for a time in Panama City, having then embarked on writing my own first book, a thriller titled &quot;The Panama Affair&quot;.As a valuable research tool, a damn good read, and a fascinating history of how this project to breech the tropical disease infested jungle, and cut a hole through a small mountain range with early twentieth century technology came into being - along with a new nation; and the politcal machinations and deviousness that lay behind its creation, McCullouch's masterpiece has no equal."},{"Title":"The path between the seas : the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914","review":"This amazing work is the best novel never written. David McCullough has found a way to make history alive with a passion that most other authors can only dream of. At once an adventure story, a mystery, a Shakespearean tragedy (complete with a deeply flawed hero), a surreal comedy, and triumph of grim determination the story of the struggle to unite the seas is uplifting in its clear presentation of true, though nearly unbelievable, facts. A short read despite its length. Will make you want to got to Panama."},{"Title":"The path between the seas : the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914","review":"Having lived in Panama, along the Canal, and having read this book both before and while living down there I can say that the author did a splendid job. Most Americans today only vaguely realize that we &quot;dug a canal&quot; in Panama years ago. The full story is fascinating history. McCullough weaves a detailed yet very readable story of political will, international intrigue, national pride, and engineering excellence to show that the creation of the canal was one of the crowning American achievements of the 20th century - the &quot;moon shot&quot; of it's day! Wonderful!"},{"Title":"The path between the seas : the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914","review":"I certainly did not expect too much excitement from a 700 pages book about the Panama Canal, but David McCullough did an excellent job. He obviously did a lot of research, but his true accomplishment is putting all the little fragments together to one exciting story. This is not just history, it is politics, business, engineering, medicine, etc. And best of all, it is very well written and easy to read.I like it even better than &quot;Truman&quot;, McCulloughs most famous book."},{"Title":"The path between the seas : the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914","review":"David McCullough has one of the best minds today. His writing style is very easy to read and has a cadence that is natural, full of facts and makes you a part of history.I was so impressed (I have about 8 of his books) I sent a letter to him via the publisher thanking him for being who he is.He is a very gracious man and actually sent me a reply.Anything you read or see with his narration is a class act."},{"Title":"The path between the seas : the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914","review":"An exciting book that covers a fascinating time in American history.

This book did not win a Pulitzer but clearly is worthy of consideration."},{"Title":"The path between the seas : the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914","review":"I HAVE READ THE PATH BETWEEN THE SEAS AT LEAST 5 TIMES, AND I GAIN NEW INSIGHT INTO THE TREMENDOUS SCOPE OF THE CANAL AND ITS BUILDERS WITH EVERY READING.I SPENT TWO YEARS IN PANAMA COURTESY OF THE US ARMY AND HAVE PERSONALLY SEEN ALL THE LOCKS AND THE MANY HISTORIC SITES THAT THE BOOK VISITS AND I CAN TELL YOU IF YOU CANNOT VISIT PANAMA,BY ALL MEANS READ THIS. I ONLY WISH THAT IT HAD PREDATED MY TOUR-THE BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ."},{"Title":"The path between the seas : the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914","review":"As others have said, this is an engrossing and fascinating book. I'm going to the Panama Canal soon, and this is THE book to read in preparation--my trip will be much more meaningful because of it.However, as good a job as McCullough does telling the story (and even that could be more clearly laid out), I find this to be one of the most frustrating books I've ever encountered.No one would read such a detailed book without paying close attention to the people and places. That's the entire point. There are thousands of details, and many players in this huge story and any reader of such a book deserves a bit of help.It's a book about geography and people. That means we need maps and photographs. In this book of nearly 700 pages, there are ONLY two maps, and they aren't very good. Often important places are mentioned time and again, but are NOT on either of the maps. An example: the early French routes proposed for the Canal are not clearly shown anywhere, though they are a big part of the story.This is much like a textbook in scope, and thus it would be extremely helpful to have maps--even small ones--scattered throughout and clearly labeled with what's being discussed.There are photographs, printed on four sections of semigloss paper, but it's up to the reader to flip through the pictures and try to relate them to the text. How much trouble would it have been to link an image to the text at appropriate places? Something simple, like, \\"see photo on page 55\\" would make the reader's job easier, make the book more memorable, and keep constant flipping and searching to a minimum.Finally, and I honestly feel bad about writing this because it is such a fascinating work, I think this book would have benefited organizationally from heads and subheads. This would help the reader keep perspective and not get lost in the many, many small (yet important) details.As I've said, it's a great book, a monumental effort. It's just that it is SO frustrating to be reading closely, following along, and then not be able to find important points on the map. Or to remember that you've seen a photo of a dredge somewhere in the book... but it's up to you, the reader, to find it.I feel sure that these were editorial or production decisions, and not McCullough's. But, in a book of 692 pages, what could it have hurt to put it a few maps to help the reader really understand the big picture? I'd sure have been glad to pay an extra dollar, if that's what it would have taken."},{"Title":"The path between the seas : the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914","review":"Having spent the first twelve years of my life (1933-1945) in the Canal Zone, and with a father that began working for the Panama Railroad Company when he was only nineteen, I have always had an interest in the history of that great achievement. Thus, I have read many books on the subject. This was by far the most in depth, detailed and INTERESTING of them all. The author tied all the various entities involved into one fascinating story, although historical, that seemed like a developing dramatic story. If someone wants to learn about this \\"wonder of the world\\" achievement and do so in an enjoyable manner, this book is for you."},{"Title":"The path between the seas : the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914","review":"THE PATH BETWEEN THE SEAS has three super things going for it. First, it's written by David McCullough, a popular historian with spellbinding storytelling ability. Second, it involves shady business deals and even shadier politics. Third, it's about using big, noisy machines to move dirt around, and what guy (at least) hasn't liked that since playing with Tonka trucks?The Panama Canal was an amazing engineering feat for its time (it opened in 1914); indeed it remains a marvel to this day. It was terrifically hard to build, and cost tens of thousands of lives, but in the end was proven to have been beautifully designed. The French had attempted to build a sea-level canal in the 1880s and 1890s, but failed. The Americans, who had been thinking of a Nicaraguan route, took over the French project, and through grit and determination--and, crucially, realization that a canal with locks was the only practicable solution--finally triumphed. The breaking out of the Great War (World War I) overshadowed the long awaited opening of the Canal, but the Canal soon demonstrated its worth.McCullough is, as to be expected, an engaging writer. One gets the sense, though, that he struggled to bring some of this material alive. The first section, on the French attempts at Panama canal building, is, frankly, a bit dull. Once the Americans become involved the story takes on fresh life, either despite of or account of the Americans having engaged in some imperialistic adventuring to get a hold of the canal land under terms favorable to U.S. interests. However that may be, it's also due to the no-nonsense, clear thinking, pragmatic American engineers like John Frank Stevens and George Washington Goethals that the Americans triumphed in the wake of French failure. Also, as McCullough points out, by the time the locks were built the available technology had improved enormously since French days.The abridged audio version likely does not do justice to the very long original work (700 pages); one notices the gaps. But the audio version nonetheless gives you the salient points about the Canal's construction, and it's read beautifully by actor Edward Herrmann. McCullough is at his best with the biographical material. Financial details and French politics aren't as compelling as his stories about the people that led the project. One wishes, though, for more anecdotes about the average people who did all the heavy lifting, as it were. Those were the guys playing with the Tonka trucks."},{"Title":"The path between the seas : the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914","review":"This is a 'must read' for anyone going through the Panama Canal. McCullough is a very good historian who writes in a style that makes for an interesting read, even the sections about the technicalities of building the canal. I had a much more enjoyable cruise for having read this book about the people and passions involved in the creation of the \\"Path Between the Seas\\"."},{"Title":"The path between the seas : the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914","review":"Fascinating, well-researched history of the building of the canal- details, intrigues and insights into personalities and controversies from the very beginning until 1914. The book was published in 1977 so the canal's most recent history -the relinquishment of the Canal Zone by the US to the Panamanians - is not covered."},{"Title":"The path between the seas : the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914","review":"This book is a highly informative account of the entire history of the contemplation and building of the Panama Canal involving many nations across several decades. The difficulties facing any entity, private or public, considering building an Isthmus-crossing canal were unbelievable: the sheer complexity of the canal design; the volume of earth to move and the size of the structures to build; the huge and multi-dimensional labor force; the tremendous earth-moving machinery required and its effective usage; the magnitude and difficulties of coordinating all the work; the decimating impact of yellow fever and malaria on the work force; and the logistics of supplying an obscure part of the world. In addition, the political maneuverings involving the governments of France, the US, Columbia, and Panama and any number of lobbyists during several periods were crucial in deciding the location and type of an Isthmus-crossing canal, as well the decisions to proceed. The debate of whether Panama or Nicaragua was most appropriate for a canal was waged repeatedly with final decisions being made on little more than a coin-flip.Personalities are very important in the author's story. He scarcely conceals a predisposition to the belief that brilliant and appropriate men will eventually rise to meet the most difficult of challenges. Perhaps surprising to most readers is that the first attempt to build a canal across Panama was made by a private French conglomerate led by the charismatic aristocrat and entrepreneur Ferdinand de Lesseps in the 1880s. While his dominating personality persuaded many to undertake the huge risks of building a canal in Panama, his complete lack of technical competency and his tendency to ignore and conceal serious problems, thus deceiving investors, were factors in the collapse of the French effort after a near-decade of prodigious but ultimately futile efforts. What was to be a triumph of French ingenuity turned into bitter recriminations, with jail time being served by a few scapegoats.The middle third of the book is devoted to the politics of the US taking on the task of building a canal and the support of the US of the Panamanian coup in 1903. Powerful interests led by Sen John T. Morgan supported a Nicaraguan canal but President Theodore Roosevelt threw the weight of his office behind, what he considered to be the more practical alternative, Panama. An enigmatic Frenchmen, part of the de Lesseps effort in Panama, Philippe Bunau-Varilla not only was persuasive during that period but coordinated the Panama takeover. Though the US quickly came to terms with Columbia over the loss of Panama, that flexing of American power rankled for years in Latin America.The last section of the book is an amazing story of the completion, with substantial alteration, of the original French canal. After some lackluster appointees were replaced and administrative structures streamlined, serious advancement of the project began. Again, very talented individuals were key to the progress. Dr. William Gorgas was able to implement a country-wide program of eradicating mosquitoes, the carriers of yellow fever and malaria. John Stevens, a veteran of railroad design, in his role as chief engineer undertook a vast improvement of the infrastructure of Panama, such as housing, sewerage, and water supply, greatly improving the well-being of the labor force and also devised a means of non-stop digging and movement of dirt. The author suggests that Stevens' efforts were perhaps most important for the project's completion, yet he is largely forgotten because he prematurely resigned. His successor, George Goethals, though rather aloof, proved to be an equally able administrator and saw the Panama Canal through to its completion in 1914.The story told is complicated with many considerations and individuals involved. However, at times, almost too much detail is provided - too many names, too many physical descriptions of people. The luminous personality of de Lesseps gets excessive attention, as well as the political intrigue in France and the US. It was not the author's intent to write an exposition on canal building; the approach is far more social, political, and economic. It's impossible to read this book without coming to realize the sheer audacity and improbability of building a canal across Panama, especially one hundred years ago.PS. Though not especially emphasized by the author, this book is a cautionary tale for grandiose schemes and schemers. In this case the half-baked plan eventually was successful, but at tremendous costs in lives, savings of small investors, and total funds. One need only look at the financialization of the US economy and the costs to most of us to see that con men are alive and well."},{"Title":"The path between the seas : the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914","review":"This Pulitzer-prize winning book tells of the creation of the Panama Canal, and in doing so, gives a great introduction to the American century. The book is written in third person, and follows the who, what, when, where and how of this great undertaking. The who includes engineers, politicians, business leaders, and common laborers who manned the machines that dug the canal. The what includes detailed descriptions of the work that went into making the canal, with a good recall of the businesses involved in this great undertaking, such as General Electric. The when is 1870 - August 1914, a period that straddles the turn of the century and the transition from Europe to America as the economic powerhouse of the world, a nation that could perform the greatest feat of construction and engineering then known to man. The where is not just Panama, but also the US and France, where political decisions were made that determined the location of the canal, and the type of canal it would become. The how is where this book excels. The author does a great job in examining the political processes in Congress and Roosevelt's administration that led to America taking over the construction. Names like Robert Woods (of Sears fame), John Knox, Gustav Eiffel (Eiffel Tower), and other celebrities of that time were linked in some way or another to the canal are all mentioned in this tome.The book also comes with two sets of photographs. These include photos of the key individuals along with shots of the canal in various stages of completion.

Long (more than 650 pages) and printed in small font size. However, it is so full of interesting information (told in good and entertaining prose), documented facts, and historic photographs, that it is real pleasure to read. It covers more than 40 years of history of one of the greatest construction projects ever: the Panama Canal. From the failed efforts of the Frenchman Ferdinand de Lesseps to the completion of the canal by the Americans, David McCullough masterly describes with exquisite detail the intricacies of financial schemes, international politics and obscure legal maneuvers that made possible the construction of the waterway between the oceans. There is also plenty of human drama, tales of success and failure, survival and death, pride and shame. Particularly interesting to me where the sections detailing the development of measures to control mosquito-born diseases that decimated workers and engineers and their families. This accomplishment not only advanced science, but made possible the continuation and completion of the work. The final chapters provide many particulars about the dimensions and operation of the locks allowing the reader to understand and admire the amazing nature of this gigantic undertaking.

Mr. McCullough is a superb writer. The 600+ pages passed rapidly. I was totally absorbed. Mr. McCullough makes come alive all the people involved in this gigantic endeavor. I could almost see Teddy Roosevelt, Goethals, Gorgas, Stevens and all of the people involved including wives and politicians.

McCullough's ability to comprehensively deliver on all the relevant historic facts, as well as present highly readable and entertaining human interest stories, made this book an outstanding read, even though it was published in 1977. When we toured Panama, the Panama Canal and associated museums, now all maintained by the Panamanian government, the museum display captions were all written in Spanish, and effectively translated by our multi-lingual guide, but it felt as if he was actually reading from McCullough's book. Once we returned from the cruise and I no longer had access to the ship's copy of McCullough's work, I had to get one of my own."},{"Title":"The path between the seas : the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914","review":"I read this book many years ago. While it was full of interesting and compelling facts, it was also hard to put down. McCullough has proven more than once since then that he is a master historian and an accomplished writer. However, this may very well be one of his finest efforts.The task of building the Panama Canal was enormous. First the French tried (DeLesseps, the architect of the Suez Canal) and failed and then the Americans under Teddy Roosevelt threw in to make an effort. The politics (both foreign and domestic) are intriguing but the project itself was beyond anything ever before attempted by Americans.Using steam shovels, dynamite and hordes of manual labor, the Americans succeeded where others had failed. The canal is arguably the greatest engineering feat in the history of mankind (up to that time) and McCullough tells us all how it happened!John E.

However, McCullough spends far too much time with our friends the French. He whitewashes them and seems to even prefer them to the Americans who follow them in Panama and especially Teddy R. As a liberal McCullough launches into their usual apologetic critism of America, Americans, all things American, and of course our turn-of-the-century civil rights. Personally, I am so tired of their constant apologies and chest beating over America, from \\"wounded knee\\" onward! Yes, we are not perfect but I believe we are the best of all present countries. McCullough willingly forgives the French their rampant graft and constant lying. All-in-all, the book is rewarding but filled with David's personal values, which frankly I found to be offensive."},{"Title":"The path between the seas : the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914","review":"Before cruising the Canal, this spell-binding book will make your journey a rich and exciting experience."},{"Title":"The path between the seas : the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914","review":"As another reviewer wrote, if you're looking for a book to keep you glued to the edge of your seat, this is not like the one for you.

He is probably responsible for quite a bit of the modern Canal tourism!"},{"Title":"The path between the seas : the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914","review":"It takes a good author to make a subject like this interesting. McCullough accomplished it!The story behind the Canal is so much more than just the physical construction involved. The years of the French construction involved a lot of corruption and scandal that I'd never heard about!Then, after about two decades, American takes over, and within a few years the canal is open for traffic. The successful fight against the deadly mosquito was one of the turing points.McCullough talks a lot about some of the politics involved, in both the French and the American stages. The story behind the Panamanian revolution was quite interesting. . . the US more or less \\"stole\\" Panama from Columbia, I guess you could say.Definitely a good book, and worth your time to read."},{"Title":"The path between the seas : the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914","review":"The Panama Canal started as the dream of the Frenchman who oversaw the creation of the Suez canal, and he over-optimistically belived that the Panama Canal would be an easier job and that technical geniuses would (almost) magically solve whatever problems arose.As is usual in a major project, the canal was completed neither on time nor in budget. The 10-foot-per-year rainfall made the terrain a quagmire that instantly rusted the machinery, and the native diseases caused tragic losses among the families of the management and workers alike. A massive river blocked the way and a mountain had to be moved on the way to the other shore. The overall configuration of the canal was undecided till the project was significantly underway.Partway through, the project suffered a loss of public support and was abandoned, only to be taken over by Americans who arrogantly thought that their confidence and knowledge would make the job easy.This whole adventure was a project management nightmare and an epic tale of courage, personal strength and hubris.

I can't believe all the \\"light weights\\" who felt the book was a \\"hard\\" read or \\"not bad\\"....whatever!First off...anytime I intend to read a long, or in-depth work, I always stick to my mantra no matter what: \\"a chapter a day keeps the doctor away\\" - whether it takes 30 minutes or two hours. You can polish off War and Peace easily and not be overwhelmed - AND actually remember everyone's names and comprehend/enjoy the book, whatever it is. To each his own though...Having said that, it's a great story - period. The reason virtually half the book is dedicated to unraveling the characters of the French effort is...uh...because they started it! Having read it, I greatly appreciated the insight into that (and the fascinating characters/controversy) which, until reading it, I had always sorta thought was, \\"o.k., the French started it but then we did everything!!! yeaaa!\\".It's just not how the events unfolded.What a silly assessment to suggest there was too much French coverage. That would be like becoming impatient that a World War One book discussed too many events in European countries before mentioning the efforts of the U.S. to assert itself!Finally, I'm especially captivated by the very peculiar relationship the U.S. has had with the French, since even the revolutionary war times. If you read Frederick Douglas's excellent bio. George Washington, you will get more taste of this bizarre love, hate, respect, detest, admire, and mutual help that we always give each other over the years. To me it's quite interesting to observe. Even now, if WWIII broke out today, it probably wouldn't be long 'fore we would be helping each other like true brothers, only to go back pontificating how completely wacked out of our gords we both are.I think the French connection was clearly the MOST fascinating thread throughout the book. After all, THEY built the Suez canal FIRST and...uh, screwed it all up on the Panama Canal...and we determined to build/complete it in my estimation on sheer ego alone (That's my boy Teddy!). You can't get soap operas like this on daytime! Truth IS stranger than fiction....Great book."},{"Title":"The path between the seas : the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914","review":"I bought this book for my husband prior to going on a cruise through the Panama Canal.

I am glad that I read it in preparation for the trip.The first third or so of the book is on the initial French effort to build a canal in Panama and is fascinating. This is the best part of the book. It is well researched and captivating. The second part of the book tells the American political tale of choosing Panama over Nicaragua and supporting the Panamanian revolution and separation from Colombia. This part of the book is also very good. The final part of the book is on the construction of the canal and I found this part to be less good, not bad but perhaps rushed or hurried. Perhaps the author had to cut back the text for this part? The friend that recommended the book stopped reading it during the third part, which confirms my take.The construction of the Panama Canal was a monumental effort at an important time in America's emergence on the world stage.

The story includes much of the politicking that preceded the USA involvement in removing the Canal Zone from the jurisdiction of Colombia and the complicated and possibly illegal way it was done. I had no concept of how tropical diseases yellow fever and malaria had impacted the French attempt to build the Canal,or how the almost complete eradication of yellow fever there was achieved by the same team that first sucessfully tried their public heath methods in Havana, but were stopped for some time from applying their successful method by redtape and lack of belief in it by their superiors The book is longer than most so be prepared to spend a few hours reading it.

While we had some inkling of the engineering and health challenges that faced its builders, we were ignorant of the commercial escapades incident to its conception, planning and construction. We also learned more about the politics of the project that included the creation of the nation of Panama and the roles of historic American figures in the process.

THE PATH BETWEEN THE SEAS fits that bill perfectly. I highly recommend this book. It is both an interesting and an easy read.My impression at the end was surprise at how little about the actual construction is included in over 600 pages of research and writing. The amazing thing is that there is so much to this story; that the physical construction, while ultimately the real story, is but a part of that story. The book paints a broad picture of the whole canal effort from the Private French Effort and failure through the American purchase and eventual success.With the benefit of hindsight it is inconceivable that Ferdinand de Lesepps would attempt to build the canal as a privately funded project. Most of the first half of the story unfolds beneath the backdrop of the incredible costs of the project. Ultimately, these costs along with the tropical diseases overcame the French effort.Beyond the gargantuan efforts needed to fund the French Canal is the amazing realization that the work was started without a clear idea of how it was to be completed. In this age of thousand page contracts, imagine starting to dig through the Culebra Cut without any idea of how to cross the Chagres River!I was stunned to learn that a decade later even our American effort was begun without a clear idea of how to finish the job. Yes, this was the time of Iron Men: men of vision, courage and audacity.The narrative of Panamanian Independence reflects poorly on all involved: the Panamanians, Colombians and American Foreign Policy, but it is not quite fair to pass judgment with 100 years of perspective.The medical successes of Dr Gorgas and the Engineering success of Wallace, Stevens, Goethals and their teams should be a source of immense pride for every American and should be a story with which every educated American is familiar.De Tocqueville observed: \\"America is great because America is Good.\\" Our country's efforts in Panama were indeed great and the results of those efforts have resulted in an incalculable good for all of mankind.Read this book and make sure your children know this story.Semper Fi,Joe Rooney"},{"Title":"The path between the seas : the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914","review":"I have just got around to reading this book after having read several others by the author. It is THE definitive work on the Panama Canal. But it is more than a story of digging a ditch. It is a tale of international intrigue, the rise of the United States into a world power, the slow demise of French influence in the world and of an incredible engineering feat that astounds us today.The canal started out as a dream: To travel from Atlantic to Pacific without going around the tip of South America. France had eliminated the need to round Africa with the Suez Canal and she hoped to do the same here. Yetm despite her educational system, training, history and spirit of achievement she was not up for the task and the result was the end of France as a world power. (She suffered humiliating swift defeats in both World Wars.)Another sub-story is the location battle. Panama won through a combination of marketing (smart and deceptive) and luck. This is also the tale of the first modern American president - Teddy Roosevelt. It was his drive, ambition and vision for the nation that propelled him to support such a mission. The United States emerged from the ordeal stronger, a more mature country than when it began, and with a firm start on the road to becoming the technical and industrial giant of the world. This nation of a hundred million folks became a dynamo that affected industry and science from that point on. It was the Panama Canal that started us on this long road.McCullough writes in a manner similar to Paul Johnson. He ably combines a historical tale with captivating sagas of individual triumphs and defeats. This humanizes the story and makes us realize that history is more than dates and battles. In the end, history is about people."},{"Title":"The path between the seas : the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914","review":"McCullough never ceases to please and the Path Between the Seas: The Creation of the Panama Canal 1870-1914, continues this trend. He's written about great politicians, such as Truman and Roosevelt, and about significant engineering feats such as the building of the Brooklyn Bridge.McCullough always brings out the human drama that unfolds beyond his main subject and, in the Path Between the Seas, he provides us with the human tragedy and events that went into the making of the Panama Canal, the great passage way between the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.The French were the pioneers in this Panamanian adventure and the strength and resolve that they put into the Canal, as told by McCullough, was astounding. To finish the job, McCullough provides a vivid accounting of the revolutionist action to form the independent county of Panama so that the Americans could complete the Canal.Designed to expand and enhance commerce and provide a valuable and quickened pasage way for the defense of the continents of South and North America, the Panama Canal is probably taken for granted today. But, the human sacrifice and courage that went into this great engineering feat is not lost because McCullough provides us with the footprints of history on this grand adventure."}]`),P={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:A},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:q,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},C={class:"card-container"},S=["disabled"],x={key:0},H={key:1};function j(n,o,s,u,r,i){const c=m("PoemCard");return e(),t("section",null,[o[1]||(o[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),a("div",C,[(e(!0),t(y,null,g(i.visiblePoems,(h,f)=>(e(),w(c,{key:f,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(e(),t("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:o[0]||(o[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(e(),t("span",H,"Loading...")):(e(),t("span",x,"See more"))],8,S)):p("",!0)])}const Z=d(P,[["render",j],["__scopeId","data-v-65fd8d1f"]]),E=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotes/3.md","filePath":"quotes/3.md"}'),W={name:"quotes/3.md"},R=Object.assign(W,{setup(n){return(o,s)=>(e(),t("div",null,[b(Z)]))}});export{E as __pageData,R as default};
